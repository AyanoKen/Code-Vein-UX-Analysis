A huge amount of customization tools to shape your character.+ Fun side diversions including side dungeons, quests, vestiges, trading through friendship points and more.+ The story gets better as the game progresses, generating interest from the player and evolving into a series of developments.- Doesn't quite live up to the potential it has when compared to other games of this style.- Takes a while to get good, players must get to the 5th area (not counting the home base) to truly experience what this game has to offer, which might turn them away before they get there. Introduction Code Vein is a soul's base game that sticks to the core elements but brings new ones to the table. It manages to create its own identity and make a name for itself in a genre that's been popular. Weapon styles, classes, and skills have a lot of variations making the game combat fun to experiment with and tailored to personal tastes. Its unique storytelling and mechanics set it apart from its peer and creates a sort of hybrid that is an interesting addition to these types of games. Gameplay Code Vein gameplay features a huge array of options when it comes to combat. Weapons have their unique moves in contrast to many soul games, which creates their fighting style in the game. Gear can affect movement, changing the type between a roll or a dash or affecting the skills used in combat. Classes feature a bunch of archetypes from healers to tanks to battlemages.The mix of these creates a loadout that you can use, and it is rewarding to see one own character become stronger and shaping their approach to enemies, exploration, and bosses. For example, a defensive style with a lance, using long reach to hit enemies before they can even strike you can be combined with defensive skills such as area knockbacks that push enemies away, projectiles of ice to have a long-range option and defense boosts.Apart from the customization options, the game follows the traditional formula. Players explore dungeons, find the boss, beat it and keep moving on. The difference here is the AI system that the game has chosen to implement as buddies you can take with you.The game is always based on having a buddy with you so some parts can feel unfair if you don't have them, but they don't make the game a breeze. While how they will exactly act to a situation is random, my experience with them is that they usually do a good job at tanking enemies, assisting in damage and saving the player from death through healing.It is satisfying to see your loadout work well together and hit enemies, exploring the depths of it while getting a sensation of achievement when getting something that clicks together well. Classes can be changed at any time outside of combat which allows for a fluid experience when trying out new skills and weapons as well as providing options on the fly. Strong points The game strong points are its story which if you take it seriously and give it a chance, is good. I know some players are not into the anime visuals, but if you see past that it will make you invested in it. The combat which features lots of options never gets stale and is satisfying to use your loadout to its max capacity. The character creation and design feature a good array of mixers and options while keeping a design that is not overwhelming or filled with unnecessary elements.One of the things that the games have going for is regarding encounters with the enemies are the ambushes. Sometimes, enemies will appear in larger numbers. This is a great idea as it creates tense moments when being surrounded and changes the pacing when progressing through dungeons. Defeating all these enemies will give a good chunk of haze which is the equivalent of souls in other games and sometimes hand out special rewards.This is where the strategic part of the game comes in, knowing where enemies could come front and what type of attacks they use will dictate your approach to them. Combat is fast and ambushes can be ruthless so knowing when to fight and when to retreat is key. Story The game story is possibly the best it has to offer along with is combat. The pace is well maintained and is never too slow or rushed, making the world more tangible to the player. The story features character development and it also expresses a lot of emotions, from moments of happiness to sadness or regret. During the first hours, it can seem a bit melancholy, but once you get past that you find out it is a more complex story that at first glance.One of the core things that keep Code Vein unique among its peers is how it approaches the foundation of its lore build and story. To do this the game has something called ""Vestiges"". Vestiges are divided into parts and each of them explores a segment of the character, whenever they are their origins, story, beliefs or development.These are well crafted, short yet impactful. Through connecting the dots across various vestiges, one can piece together parts of the game's story. How the world came to be or how the characters related to one another. When a game makes a character likable and to care about them in 10 minutes, that is an achievement.Paying attention to vestiges will allow for a better experience story-wise while making classes stronger. It offers lore and attracts player through the offer of progression. Some Notes The game runs well on a GTX 1060, solid 60 FPS on the highest settings. Online can be clunky sometimes but my overall experience with it was decent.Early parts of the game can be lacking, however, once one reaches the 5th area in the game (the ""white"" area) it becomes an improved version of it. Bosses start to be more challenging with and more special while enemy design evolves into complex versions that represent a huge danger to the player. Finally. Exploration stops being straightforward as puzzles and multiple paths begin to show and areas become much bigger.AI partners are a mixed bag, some people like them, others hate them. Sometimes they are useful and smart, and other times they can be lackluster. Overall my time with my partners was good and they live up to their job, assisting me in meaningful ways and not feeling particularly overpowered but rather like a useful companion. What Makes It Special What makes the game special is that it tries to break the mold of a genre that has been static for a long time. It takes its share of risks by introducing new elements and changing how the story is told through a more common medium rather than through imagination.Its character creator is probably one of the most complete and complex ones, it has tons of options and people can go crazy with it. Is a huge improvement in this genre and it looks very pretty to the eye. Main character design is also fantastic, keeping a low profile yet looking good aesthetically. Conclusion Code Vein is a fantastic new IP and it has a lot going for it in this genre. I think this is a game that could get its following and that could be seen more of in the future. With its approach to storytelling, huge options in a combat that is fast-paced with a strategic mindset and depths, it is a game that I can recommend to any fan of the soul's series and players who like this kind of game.

Recommended,98.6,"																I'm writing this as a Dark Souls veteran (1000+ hours) who doesn't really care for Anime.First off - is this Anime Souls? Absolutely.But is it a bad ripoff? Absolutely not.Overall comparison:- movement is a bit more floaty in this one- Combat feels a bit less beefy but still very good- Weapon movesets have been replaced with active skills which I like more. You unlock them over time and after mastering each skill you can mix and match cross classes- Bosses are very similar to Souls but still feel fresh and challenging- most of the consumables and game mechanics are basically 100% copy&paste from Souls, which I don't mind because of the familiarity it creates for players like me- Level design also feels very similar with shortcuts and gorgeous views along the wayThe story gets interesting very fast with elements of post-apocalypse, underground rivers of Blood, Vampires etc.When it comes to the art style - I'm not a fan of Anime in general, but holy hell this game looks gorgeous! The characters are lively animated, the world is interesting with lots of details, it's colorful and the character customization is the best I've ever seen in any game. You can not only change your person itself but you can also customize different outfits and change between them whenever you want. Fashion Souls+Oh yeah one mention about the difficulty: some people say this game is easier than Souls - wrong. Turn the AI companion off and you'll see. First ""real"" boss took me 20+ tries and it felt just as rewarding to finally beat it.Overall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of deep character customization and want a fresh Souls experience in a wonderful world with gorgeous characters and interesting story.

Recommended,41.3,"																There are a lot of Soulslike games these days flooding the market. Most of them are usually either under developed or derivative of the Souls genre and often only amuse for an hour or two at best. Code Vein is one of the rarer exceptions that actually is able to pull off interesting and fun souls like gameplay, albeit not perfectly.A brief overview of the world. Code Vein takes place in a post-apocalyptic city (probably in Japan). The land was decimated by an entity known as the Queen. You play as a revenant, one of many warriors who had a BOR parasite implanted in order to kill the Queen during the end of the world. However, revenants now are reduced to desperate survivors who thirst for human blood. You are awakened and accompanied by a girl called Io who seems to be the only one who knows of your origins. Eventually, you and Io meet with a crew of Revenants led by a young man named Louis. It is then up to you and your ragtag team of mutant warriors seek to discover the truth of the red mist. A miasma that turns ordinary Revenants into monstrous creatures called The Lost. Gameplay is very similar to souls in movement and combat. If I had to name a game it resembles the most I would have to say both Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne respectfully (and not just because of the constant use of blood in the games world and lore.) You are incentivised to be a lot more aggressive than your average souls affair, shields are not in the game, though a block feature does exist which does have it's uses. Code Vein expects you to charge right in and get slashing, chopping or smashing.The enemies in this game, the Lost, are also hyper aggressive and can really cause you troubles if you let them. Even a basic lost warrior can eat half your health in one strike if you are not careful. Possibly even all of it if you are under equipped and under levelled. The game requires you to slaughter them first or they will slaughter you. Healing items are scarce at first and will never be as effective as estus, even at maximum efficiency. Luckily you do have a pretty interesting arsenal to deal with these foul beasts.Code Vein doesn't have as many armaments as the souls series. There are only 6 specific weapon types. Your armour is also limited based on your play-style, some have more armour for tanks while others empower your magic while offering little to no resistances. What make's Code Vein special to me however is the Blood Code System. Blood Codes are classes which can be switched on the fly. These Codes have base stats like health, resistances, magic points and so on. In each code are abilities, both passive and active which you can use in battle. Some are minor enhancements like more HP, more DPS dealt while below 50 HP, etc. While some can be massive abilities like creating a barrier to deflect physical damage or casting fireballs like a mage. What makes this system so alluring to me is that Code Vein encourages multi-classing. These abilities are not locked to just one class and when mastered can be attached to another class. Meaning that you could start as a DPS class like the Prometheus class at first, but then marry those abilities into a more tank based class like Atlas later. There are some restrictions however. For example the Atlas blood code cannot use A class spells as its spell casting ability is only D class. It's an amazing system that rewards experimentation that gave me pleasant Final Fantasy V flashbacks.Code Vein also prioritises the use of companions in battle. This is optional and can be turned off for the truly sadistic. You have a small but useful range of companions to pick from. The aforementioned Louis is a strong DPS caster. His best friend and (in my personal opinion) best bro in the whole game, Yakumo is a solid tank. There are others to pick which are unlocked during the story.Now for the last real highlight for me. The character customisation. Code Vein has, in my opinion, the most diverse and in depth anime character creator ever made. You can customise your hair with various extensions, modify your clothes with misc items, pick from loads of different faces, hats, voices. It's a time sink for sure and I would be lying if I said I didn't spend about an hour of my play time just making my anime protagonist look good.Now though, I need to address some of the drawbacks of Code Vein. One of them is the level design. Souls games are known for their beautiful vistas and stunning visual design. Code Vein is mostly just ruined cities, ruined industrial towns, ruined industrial towns with snow. The only visually striking area is the Cathedral, the fourth area of the game and in my opinion, one of the worst designed levels in souls like gaming. The cathedral is a huge, white complex of insect like architecture mixed with classical church aesthetics. What makes it awful is the sheer amount of wrong turns, pitfalls and enemy traps. The level is made out of roughly 5 rooms and walkways that are copy and pasted so much it gets to the point of irritation. This level is by far the longest in the game and is easily the worst. Worse is that they had the balls to literally copy the cathedral level and make a second area with the exact same design. The same rooms and layouts, the only difference being is that it's purple. Luckily at that stage of the game, a player is at a high enough level to blast through it. Even the final level of the game isn't super interesting. Unlike the Kiln of the first flame, the final area is just a crypt with a throne room that looks unremarkable.  Now this one may be up to personal taste. Code Vein is very ""open"" with its character design. Alright I’ll cut to the chase. Boobs, and lots of them. It makes that clear when the first thing you see when you awaken in the streets is Io’s face hidden behind her E sized boobicles. I personally do not have a major problem with this kind of design but it does feel at best, a little tasteless and at worst downright sleazy. If you have issues with this kind of design then I don’t think this will be a good experience for you. While not as egregious as some games out there, namely the cheap tat on the mobile market. I will say that discretion is advised.My final issue is with the bosses. Souls games have a wonderful balance of world exploration and boss fights. Each one compliments the other. Using everything you learn in the overworld to take on the boss, then using boss knowledge to better understand the next area. In Code Vein, the overworld is great at teaching you the mechanics for the game. However the bosses you face are mostly just big sponges that require little more than good dodging and opportunity attacks. The only bosses that break this habit are The Queen's Knight and The Gilded Hunter, who can both really mess you up if you are not on point with your movements, magic usage and heals. Some bosses are also highly exploitable. A late game boss was completely cheesed because I used a fire resistance ability from my blood code, which negated her magical attacks, pairing that with a physical resist meant her originally lethal fire claw attacks were ENTIRELY useless against me. This was not intentional, I just tweaked my stats and abilities and the game wasn't ready for it.So, to finally sum up my thoughts, Code Vein is a mechanically interesting, addictive soulslike with just enough interest to keep me going through the game. It's story actually had me feeling emotional at some points, specifically with best bro Yakumo's character arc and its conclusion. While it does have problems in its level design and boss mechanics, I do not think that that is a deal breaker for me. It may be for those who love to drink in the incredible scenery of the souls games or those who are very mechanically minded. I for one though enjoyed my time with the game. For an arbitrary score, it's a solid 7.8/10			"
Recommended,23,"																It’s like all those anime with overpowered protagonists. Except you’re not the protagonist.Code Vein really makes you FEEL like anime.It’s easy Soulsborne with anime tropes. I mean you immediately know it’s anime when you character starts with amnesia. What’s that? There’s hot springs too? Definitely anime Dark Souls.I mean if Dark Souls is a world class 5 star burger, Code Vein is a McDouble. I like McDoubles ya know? But, you know, don't expect a culinary awakening.Let me just say that the game is fun, but it’s not able to stand on par to any of the other souls game.  Many have described it as ""Dark Souls with anime titties"", and I find the description accurate. As a souls-like fan though, I find Code Vein is definitely more in the realm of a casual souls-like. As so, be prepared for it to be not ""super"" challenging. You could probably beat it in 20-30h casually.The gameplay is the bread and butter of the game. It's fun and lets you combo ridiculous skills to do stupid damage but in return makes the game way too easy. I say it's easy but since it's a souls like the enemies will still kill you in a couple shots if you're not careful.The character customization is insane though. In terms of face customization, it's meh. But the amount of accessories you can put on your character... Nuts. Had like pouches all over my character. And being able to save/load different appearances is just great.Also if after reading all the reviews you still want the game, then dont even bother with the DLC's. It’s the most useless piece of trash that I’ve ever seen added to a game as additional paid content. Please for the love of god don't get the DLC's.Basically if you're looking for that souls-like itch but not a big challenge with modern anime vampires and hentai waifus, Code Vein is worth trying out.I rate it two Niohs out of Dark Souls 2			"

Recommended,152.3,"																It is pretty much what it looks like, an anime-like dark souls, with a more explicit story and a different take on character progression and building. *Technically it's basically flawless for me, looks good, runs well, no significant bugs encountered (just a couple of flickering textures and that's about it). *Being able to change your build on the fly without having to respec is really neat.*Combat works well and is fun, it's not hard once you get the hang of it but the healing available to enemy damage ratio is kind of unforgiving, you have to try to not get hit. *Light weapons lack impact but that seems to be a deliberate choice, heavy ones feel really powerful and make you feel sorry for the poor sods you are crushing under them.*The AI partner is pretty useful and doesn't get in the way, and you can choose to go alone if you want more of a challenge (I'm eager to do a solo playthrough in NG+)*It is surprisingly polished, looks like they put the extra time from the delay to good use, it feels like a complete package, like nothing has been cut from it to sell back as DLC or microtransactions, which is refreshing nowadays. I can't guarantee that you will like it but it competently does what it sets out to do, if it looks like something you'd enjoy you probably will.The boobs are good, also.			"

Recommended,33.7,"																Oh man. I was really looking forward to Code Vein releasing, and it definitely did not disappoint once it finally did. I'm just going to say straight out, this is an easy recommendation at full price.StoryFirst off, the story does have all the hallmarks of your super convoluted, Japanese Anime writing, where you will inevitably start to wonder what the f is really going on. Where Code Vein's writing really succeeds, is in actually resolving those questions, and in interesting fashion. The story truly ended up being engaging and fairly exciting throughout, and even though there is the ever present feeling of impending doom, you are also left with a fairly hopeful and wondrous story more akin to something like Ys VIII and how they handled story resolution. It is possible to get multiple endings. I know the one I saw is considered the true ending, and I liked it a lot. However, really sharing much of anything else is an easy way to spoil the story, so I'll stop there. The rest of what you need to know is adequately shown off in the trailers IMO.GameplayYou ever played a Dark Souls game? How about Bloodborne? If you have, this game will be very easy in comparison. It has more in common with Bloodborne, but stays universally true to Soulsborne in general despite the anime flair. Also, and amusingly, since this is also a Bandai Namco title, they felt empowered to use the same menu UI and even some of the menu artwork as FromSoft does with their games. Exactly the same. However, that isn't actually bad...just amusing.With that in mind, a lot of the game does mirror FromSoft as well, and I'm not really gonna rehash that stuff. Suffice to say, if you played Bloodborne and are good with parries or dodging, you are in like Flynn here.All that said, Code Vein still does a great job of presenting enough wrinkles, twists, and even some unique additions to the Soulsborne genre, that it creates its own clear identity. For one, Blood Codes. Blood Codes replace the typical class systems, instead having you absorb the Blood Code of various companions, or learn them via absorbing memories found within the game. As a result, you can really find any playstyle you like, and can change between Blood Codes whenever you like, meaning you are never out of the game and can adapt your playstyle to suit your preferences or needs.Speaking of lost memories, when a vampire dies and is reborn again in Code Vein, they will typically forget part of their past life or lives, leaving those shards of memory in the world. Your character can and will absorb these memories, which will serve to unlock new Blood Codes and generally advance the story as well. In contrast (for NPCs), losing your memories can and will eventually lead to you becoming one of the Lost, vampires with no recollection of their human existence, living simply to feed their hunger.Because Blood Codes are at thing, actual leveling up is more in the vein of old school JRPGs, where you don't assign skills points and such, but rather receive a predetermined ability boost each time instead. Instead of souls or what have you, this game's experience points and cash is called ""Haze"", which is spendable blood for all intents and purposes. It is however used the same way as Souls. You can level up, pay to unlock abilities, and purchase items from one of three vendors available in the game (that I know of).Weapons and armor are upgradeable of course, and there is a pretty nice selection that will accomodate any specific Blood Code you choose to adopt. The boss fights were by and large pretty easy in my opinion, but there was a cool variety of bosses. What makes the bosses especially easy is that, despite having different abilities, they typically present in familiar ways. They'll have light and heavy attacks, some sort of spin or explosion radius attack with an obvious wind up, and will have one or more ranged attacks to use if you simply won't engage. So, as long as you keep that in mind, no boss battle should be especially difficult outside of the first mandatory boss, which has given people fits, and ""Ornstein & Smough"" as people are calling another fight.Finally, the companion system. You will unlock many companions along your travels, who will adventure with you, fight by your side, and so on. You can select one companion to travel with at a time, and your decision will typically be based on personality (or looks lol) or on their specific Blood Code, and how well their abilities mesh with your own. It is worth noting that the companion programming is excellent, and not only will they have a positive impact on any encounters you have, but really, they will take the fight to your enemies, and will use all of their abilities, at appropriate times. Additionally, they can and will revive your character if s/he falls in battle, if they aren't in the middle of being attacked themselves. GraphicsCode Vein is quite the looker. The nature of the world is obviously darker, and so a lot of the imagery is darker and decrepit as well. However, not only are those sections of the game given a lot of detail, but the other parts of this world are simply some of the more amazing looking areas you will find in a game. Of course, as is the case with the other aspects of the game, you will find heavy doses of Dark Souls inspired areas. The most notable in my opinion, is Code Vein's version of Anor Londo, which really can't be ignored.Unlike FromSoft games, which are universally darker and grittier, the anime aspect of Code Vein provides a lot of light moments as well, and this is well represented visually.I'm also gonna mention customization here. In Code Vein, the customization depth in the character creator is one of the best out there. You could definitely spend hours perfecting your character, and there is a good chance you could get your character to look like just about anyone, with enough time and focus. It has and will definitely also continue to be a bit of a meme machine as a result.Speaking of character graphics, there is a ton of in game detail and you really get full conveyance of mood and attitude via the visual representation of characters and situations.Also, the cutscenes are top tier, and there are a ton of them. Arguably enough to fill a Code Vein movie.AudioSimilarly, the audio tracks in Code Vein are top tier. A lot of work went into the sounds of combat and general conversation, and audio cues play heavily in both exploration and combat.The real star of the show is the voice acting. Similar to the Ys series, you (the protagonist) are voiceless (outside of one line late in the game), but all the other characters and a lot of the enemies and NPCs feature full voice acting, and really, done to perfection. If I had one complaint, and this is a common one really, it would be that your companion never shuts up lol. They will have something to say about pretty much everything. Is there a ladder nearby? A barrel? Did you just walk near the edge of a cliff? They'll let you know. It's really the statements of the obvious that make it kind of humorous though. Personally, I didn't find it nearly as annoying as other people have.VerdictObviously there is plenty more that I could dive into while reviewing this game, and that depth really lends itself to a stellar experience. As mentioned in my first paragraph, this is an easy recommendation. If you are already a Soulsborne fan, you will find a markedly easier experience, but with all the things that make Soulsborne games great. It is a bit more linear and much less interconnected than FromSoft game worlds, but that isn't really a big deal. It's really a great gateway to Soulsborne as a genre.If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers."
Recommended,30.5,"																- Janky, anime souls-like. There's estus, i-frame dodges, bonfires and challenging bosses.- Let's start out saying I played this for the first time after Elden Ring because I think hindsight from that whole series is important when judging what this game does well and what it does poorly.- For the most part, areas and enemies are well balanced. Similar to the main souls series, you can adjust how challenging the game is by choosing to use or not use various components that the game presents to you. - You have NPC companions in this game which follow you and help you with fights. The AI seemed to be fairly decent, with the companion being able to fight in a semi-helpful way, and the enemy AI being able to decently split focus between the pair of you. The constant narration from the companion did grate at times though: ""You looking at your inventory?"" ""Ooh what's in the treasure chest?""- Abilities similar to weapon arts in DS3 and Elden Ring appear in this game also. They range from damaging attacks to buffs and debuffs. I found myself using the buffs for bosses more as the game progressed - a sign of good scaling difficulty. There was also a huge amount of room for customisation since you could level up your abilities and use them to create customised builds and suites of abilities. For me this didn't really manifest because, being a bit of a completionist, I found myself constantly trying to keep up with the new abilities. I think it was only the last area or two of the game I actually caught up and decided to finally put together a build beyond a buff or two.- The Cathedral area in this game is notoriously horrible. I would say it's about halfway through the game and if you're not invested I think it could kill momentum for a lot of players. The layout is frustratingly labyrinthine, and the enemies are very difficult (I died in this area more than any other). This isn't helped by the fact that it looks very very samey. I took a break out of frustration in this area at least once, which is rare for me.- Aside from this, I found a few areas where character progression didn't quite keep up with enemies. If they kill you that's fine by me, but sometimes I felt they just had too much health at a couple of points.- The story was fine and for the first half of the game I was getting into it. It got a little convoluted and dramatic in delivery towards the end and I found myself paying less attention to it. I think skipping the memory shard sequences is a great pro-tip.- The female character designs are also very provocative with lots of skin showing and cleavage - I think that could be awkward for some players, but the game doesn't cross any lines or contain any nudity.- Overall, I have highlighted a lot of negatives, but this game is a solid souls-like contender.

Recommended,57.6,"																Pro tip: You don't have to buy the game to get the best part, the character creation. Just download the free demoEnjoyed it overall, combat/exploration is fun for the most part, but a lot of disappointing and weirdly contradicting design decisions.- They obviously want you to play multiple times to see the different endings, but the free-class-changing, no-stat-points system means you can do every possible build on a single character and playthrough. You can change your character appearance completely at any time by exporting/importing from the character creation. NG+ doesn't unlock any new content, only higher difficulty. The game is also a bit too long (the infamous Cathedral zone) to want to do it 4 times. So all the usual incentives for NG+ or multiple characters/playthroughs are not present in this game.- The Depths (non-story dungeons/maps for farming) are extremely small, with fixed layout and spawns, All of them have a hub design with 2 to 4 short spokes from the start point, so you have to backtrack or teleport to the start multiple times in a tiny fixed map. Which also means you can always heal at the start so there is no sense of progressing ""deeper"" into the dungeon and having to manage resources. All maps of the same tier have the same reward so there is no reason to farm different maps/bosses. Once you unlock the boss (which is on its own, shortest spoke from the hub), you can go straight to the boss on subsequent runs, rendering the rest of the map useless. It's as if they heard of the idea of ""farming bosses"" from other ARPGs and implemented it in the least interesting, challenging, and rewarding way.- The ""interactive"" memory cutscenes are completely uninteractive. You don't do anything except hold a direction key to walk through a level with the same music and a depressing blue lighting. Somehow it's more boring than just watching a normal cutscene or clicking on text boxes.- The Blood Veils (clothing that somehow forms bio-mechanical claws) are the main character design element that is unique to this game, they're featured prominently in artwork and animated cutscenes, so you'd think there'd be special skills using it, different finishers, some importance in the story etc. Instead they are mainly used for parrying (most of the claws are too slow, and dodging is very effective, so you can go the whole game without parrying), a boring drain attack, and a single backstab animation (for each of the 4 claw types) which you will enjoy seeing over and over again. They have different stats but you can go most of the game without changing Blood Veils and just upgrading one. They also have different looks for the exact same stats veils, but instead of having some cosmetic/transmog system, you have to buy and then upgrade the same-veil-with-different-looks all the way from 0, which discourages you from changing looks.- Extremely unnecessary anime tits. I enjoy sexy characters as much as the next guy, but c'mon. Most of the monsters have decently varied designs that fit the zone theme, then suddenly the boss is a naked anime woman (with wings). Then the next area, the monsters have another set of thematic designs, and suddenly the boss is another naked anime woman (with blue skin or whatever). The later bosses are somewhat better, probably because they were too busy putting humungous badonkadonks on the NPCs instead.			"
Recommended,29.4,"																Code Vein is not a game for everyone, or even all fans of Soulslikes. If I had to use a single word to describe CV, it would be ""fine."" It's okay. Is it worth playing? Maybe.I've seen people call it ""Anime Dark Souls"" but I think a more accurate description is ""Horny Dark Souls."" From character designs to bosses, everything has that shonen anime lewdness which characterizes everything people who hate anime dunk on. Like there's a boss who is basically a mini-giantess with a pole arm she uses as a stripper pole mid-battle. If that sounds bad to you, then maybe you should just skip this game, I won't judge. Outside of that, the characters are generic anime tropes, but aren't bad. They're mostly fine, especially the Yuki Nagato clone clad only in tattered rags that shows off her breasts. She's probably my favorite character in the game, despite her outfit.If anything, Code Vein is an exploration heavy version of God Eater with Dark Souls elements. You've got your equivalent to Estus flasks, which can be further enhanced with Estus shards and undead bone shards. There are animations like crushing lifegems in DS2. Dying results in your not-souls staying where you died, allowing you to pick them up if you can make it back. The aesthetics are generally closer to God Eater's post-apocalyptic setting, and the game is visually at its best when it's not trying to be a fantasy souls game. It does have an in-game map, though, which is usually useful. There is also no PVP, which might be a deal breaker for some FromSoft Souls fans; you can still engage in jolly cooperation with other players, but it's far less prominent than in DS. The story is closer to God Eater than Dark Souls too, with everything being told to you explicitly rather than through item descriptions, environmental details, and NPC interactions.Exploration is probably the highlight of the game, but some areas are much better than others. Some areas have great interconnected paths to get to mistles/not-bonfires with secrets hidden around the map. Others are a pain to navigate. A lot of people complain about the Cathedral, and they're right. It's a bad attempt at recreating Anor Londo without the visual identity and design of Dark Souls 1's most iconic location. It's fairly easy to get lost because everything is a whitish cream color without any landmarks. Imagine if Anor Londo didn't have any of the dark inner sections lit with moody flame, the rotating towers, or the giant hall with a certain painting in it. Now make every part of the architecture look exactly the same. This is probably why the minimap was implemented, and some people still got lost. It doesn't help that, like Anor Londo, there's a mid-point where you can go to a side area and then return later, meaning you get a brief reprieve before returning to an overly long area. There's another area later on that is essentially Cathedral 2: Only Towers Edition, too. Of course, I also have to mention the fire biome where touching the walls knocks you back, often into other fire walls. Look, this all sounds negative, and it is, but there are some decent areas too. These three, especially the Cathedral, are just worth knowing about before you get into the game.Again, this might sound really negative, but you should know what you're in for if you do decide to play this game. I still had fun with it, and I think it's a solid 6. If you're not completely turned away from this game by now, maybe get in a sale. Just don't get the DLC, it adds basically nothing of value to the game outside of three cool, difficult boss fights that probably aren't worth the effort of actually reaching.Oh, and the character creator is great and probably the best part of the game. The devs should be proud of it.			"
Recommended,433.7,"																First things first: Get this game on sale. It goes on sale often enough. If you do get the game on sale, get the deluxe edition if its also on sale. It comes with some extra cosmetics, an extra blood code (see details below on what a blood code is), an extra partner, and all the DLC.TL;DR: I give this game a 9-9.5 / 10. Great game.This is one of my favorite games. I've played through it a total of 15 times so far, some of which were challenge runs like a level 1 run, a non-upgraded rusty pipe run, and a few no partner runs with different themed builds. I'll go over a some of different aspects of the game and describe what I liked/disliked.Character creation:Character creation is surprisingly really good. Starting out, it just seems like theres a bunch of presets for everything, but once you get into it, you can make some really cool characters. I've made Hatsune Miku, Ai Hoshino (from Oshi No Ko), Harley Quinn, Amy Rose, and some other characters.Pros:- Color choices are good- Presets look alright- Accessories are super fun to play around with to get something that looks perfectCons:- Outfit choices are lackingStory:I don't have a whole lot to say about the story since I don't want to spoil it. Its a good story. Some parts had me teary-eyed. The characters are all really fun and have their own stories you can choose to look through when collecting certain items.Pros:- Good story- Fun and likable characters with their own stories- Theres some good character development throughout the storyCons:- Some predictable anime tropes- You have to find the items related to characters' back stories, which means you can miss some stuff.Gameplay:The gameplay is very smooth in my opinion. Movement is smooth with the right builds, like dark souls but faster and more fluid. All the weapons are fun to play with and are all viable options. Every weapon is at least a decent choice. Gifts (spells) are plentiful and feel great to use in combat, especially since you have 8 slots for them.Pros:- Movement is great- Lots of fun spells- Weapons are greatCons:- The controls can take a bit to get used to coming from most other souls-like gamesCharacter building:The character building is great. You are able to change your build at any point in the game provided you have the correct weapons, blood veils, gifts, and blood codes. The blood codes act as a form of class with its own stat scaling, weight limits, and gifts. You can even unlock the gifts from a blood code to use with other blood codes, which can make for some really fun combinations.Pros:- Can change build at any time- With the right combinations, you can use any gift with any blood codeCons:- Stat scaling is somewhat confusing. Gear scaling uses letters and gift scaling uses numbers- Some buff gifts don't really tell the whole story when it comes to what the exact buffs areLevel design:The levels are alright. For the most part, the areas are quite linear with how you navigate them. You only backtrack a few times in the game. In terms of the setting of the levels, they lack variety. For the most part you're either in a city or a cave, with some variations and exceptions. One of those exceptions (without spoiling it too much) will make you rage.Pros:- Can be easy to navigate for the most part.- LinearCons:- Lack of variety in setting- Transitions between levels are obvious- Enemy placement seems to be designed around having an NPC partner/co-op helper, making solo runs more difficultBosses:Whats a good souls-like without good bosses? The bosses in this game definitely deliver. I had fun with every boss, even if I was upset at times (but who doesn't get upset at times with a souls-like?).Pros:- Range in difficulty- The harder bosses feel great to defeatCons:- The difficulty range isn't linear with the game's progression. Some bosses near the beginning of the game are harder than some bosses later- Like the enemy placement, bosses seems to be designed around having an NPC partner/co-op helper, making solo runs more difficultOVERALL SCORE: I give this game a 9-9.5 / 10.

One nice change is you can basically change class and skills at any time, so you can play around with different builds and new moves.The game doesn't have difficulty settings, but has a kind of indirect difficulty select:1. Go solo- this is really very difficult, significantly more so than Demon's Souls, or DS 1,2 and 3 in my opinion. Invasion enemies can overwhelm you, the bosses are aggressive and mistakes will result in quick death.2. Coop online with a friend- this was how I played most of the game and I feel this is the best experience- we still got destroyed by some bosses, but the game felt quite nicely balanced.3. Bring AI companion Yakumo- the game is quite easy as he will do most of the work- he was more effective than me or my human companion.4. Bring any other AI companion- the game feels reasonably well balanced, not too punishing or too easy.4.  Bring an AI companion and invite a friend at the same time- super easy mode.I found I wasn't really invested in the story and I was honestly skipping cutscenes to get back to the fighting.			"

Recommended,138.8,"																*SPOILER FREE!*[Why you should buy Code Vein]1. Story-RichAmong all the popular and successful titles that Bandai Namco Entertainment has developed, Code Vein is my absolute favorite because of the immersive story-line that it has. As the story dug deeper into each character's past and experiences, I became engrossed in both game play and story-line which makes it one of my most favorite video games of all time.2. Content and New Game +While you can just play the game by following the main storyline, there are many other contents such as weapons, armors, blood codes and side quests that you can collect and complete. Also, this game has multiple endings which you can only achieve by completing more than one play-through. You also have the option to increase the game's difficulty much higher by entering New Game+.3. The game is just BEAUTIFULI've already mentioned how beautiful the game's story-line is but generally, everything about this game is beautiful to me. The music while traversing a post apocalyptic city is surprisingly very soothing for my heart. I recommended this game so that everyone can experience the happiness that I felt playing this game. *mini-spoiler* My eyes watered when Eva started singing *spoiler-ends*4. Epic CustomizationCode Vein has one of the most satisfying character customization compared to all other video games that I've played. You can go for any anime look and fashion you like without adding mods and skins from the game itself!5. Co-Op SystemThe Co-Op system in this game is very unique and interesting. This game requires teamwork and understanding between you and your Co-Op partner as monsters and bosses get buffed when the game enters Co-Op mode. Resurrection in this game is beautiful. It takes away health from the player and transfers it to team, reviving dead players and healing wounded teammates as well. Playing Co-Op also rewards you with Mark of Honor medals which unlocks rewards such as titles. It is encouraged that players find a co-op partner to enjoy this game together with!6. Custom Skill Builds and ClassesOne of the most captivating thing about this game for me is that you can build your character the way you want it to be. You can become anyone from someone who one-shots bosses or a high DPS magic user.As for me, I built myself around my partner as a healer and let him carry me while I watch over him from the back-lines and keep him healthy and alive. However, there are some bosses that we cannot win with me in the back-lines as a healer, so I switch around to a ranged Bayonet class so I can help him output more damage. You can mix and match many skills and passives to get the type of game-play you want from your character. Not to mention, weapons and armors too.[You shouldn't buy this if you..]1. You shouldn't buy this if you hate hard games.While the game has so much to offer and explore, this game is very hard even on the first play-through if you are not careful. The monsters in the game can catch you by surprise and the boss fights are really difficult (which is also the main interest points of the game). Imagine an anime dark souls ^^. It also gets harder if you enter new game plus but you have an option to choose not to.2. You shouldn't buy this if you hated Dark Souls (explained above)3. You shouldn't buy this game if you hate grinding.The game has many content which will require a lot of time and focus. It has multiple endings, many items to collect, skills to level and side-quests to complete which can easily take up days and weeks off your busy schedule. 4. You shouldn't buy this game if you are looking to play Co-Op with more than one friend.While I listed as Co-Op being one of the attractions of the game, the Co-Op system in the game is a little flawed as-A) It only allows one Co-Op partner to exist in one adventure. B) You have to complete one story, two times. When your partner helps you complete your mission in the map, it only counts as story completion on your end. You also have to do the mission all over again to help your partner complete their own story.TL;DRThe game is really beautiful in my eyes and the story-line is to die for. I've cried like a baby for most of the game and if you're into video games with rich story-lines, I recommend for you to really get this game. The experience I've had in this game is already worth more than the money I've spent to get Code Vein.			"

Recommended,63.4,"																Are you looking for an easier Dark Souls? Do you like typical anime characters? Do you like wandering around somewhat mediocre maps while looking for items and trying to progress? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you'll probably like Code Vein. The game's story itself is decent, if pretty familiar. The lore is cool too in spots, but the characters are your typical assortment of anime tropes. Their character models also have a lot of clipping problems. No matter what character you're looking at, their hair clips through everything. Thankfully you can change your hair at any time. I initially gave my character the longest hair I could, but watching it clip through my entire outfit every time I moved got old.So, yeah, the combat itself moves and feels just like Dark Souls. There are five weapon types and each has a light and heavy attack. You can parry too, but you have to hit the button a couple of seconds before the enemy attack hits, which is a little weird. But the main difference is that you've got a ton of abilities you can use by switching classes known as Blood Codes. There are a ton of these and they all have different stats and their own abilities. Abilities are mainly for attacking and buffs, but there are also ones that do other stuff, such as one that lets you return to your last not-bonfire.But this isn't a challenging game. The enemies are typically pretty easy to deal with. Most bosses are too. I almost never got into a life or death struggle where my survival was based on successfully learning boss movesets. Your partner NPC heals you if you die too. And you probably won't die much. I wasn't too upset about this, although I don't really understand why someone would transplant combat built around being patient and careful into a game that wanted to be more of an full-on action RPG. I don't like how the camera tilts up when you get closer to an enemy you're locked onto, though. Makes it hard to see what's around you. This is a decently-long game, for the most part. It took me about 22 hours with some wandering, mostly in the cathedral as that level is giant and confusing as hell. Definitely the worst part of the game, really. It's all the same color and every area looks practically identical. Plus there's multiple levels. The map in this game is pretty cool and you fill it in bit-by-bit by interacting with these plant things. It also shows you where you've been. But that wasn't helpful in the cathedral so much because it has multiple floors, which was plain confusing.Overall, I like the game, though. It's not great, but it's good. The story gets better as you go and there are multiple endings, plus a new game plus and a few optional bonus levels. If you're looking for a game to just be anime Dark Souls, you won't find it here. But if you just want a fun action RPG, you'll probably enjoy yourself. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.			"
Recommended,44,"																Boobasouls or something more?Before we start, you should know you aren't getting a deep narrative, with rich and extensive lore, using the exceptionally detailed enemies, bosses, equipment, and environment filled to the brim with seemingly unimportant items to convey its vague story to the player. No, Code Vein has plenty of cutscenes, shouting, questionable camera angles, edgy baddies, spiky collars, surfer haircuts and the power of friendship.But while all of that anime cheese is good and all, it's not what made Code Vein such a blast to play. That honour belongs to its excellent gameplay. Playing the likes of Nioh, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, when I was perplexed about defeating a boss, there really was only a single choice - learn his attacks. It's either not possible to respec or very inconvenient. Thankfully, Code Vein is having none of that and lets the player tinker with the build at any moment, free of charge. At first, this system may seem convoluted, complicated, hard to grasp. But have no fear, your friendly neighbourhood slav is here.At the heart of it all lie blood codes, Code Vein's quasi classes. You obtain them from bosses, companions or in the wild. What makes them unique is the customization freedom they offer and their fixed stats. Strength, dexterity, etc., all are more or less set in stone. The only way to boost them is by using certain passive abilities. But you'll spend your time mostly buying new abilities with haze, the game's currency. Also, it's used for levelling up, which only improves your health and damage. But that's not all; Almost every ability can be inherited, thus making it usable with any compatible blood code. To inherit one, you have two choices - kill enemies to gain mastery XP or use rare items to skip that grind. But there are restrictions in place, such as having a stat be a certain level, that ""decide"" what ability you can and can't use with a particular blood code.Pro Tip: Do not power level. Each area has a level cap. You'll receive an insignificant amount of XP towards mastery if your level is too damn high. So use haze to unlock new abilities and master them. Be smort!"

Recommended,41.8,"Now, using these fun abilities requires ichor, the game's mana. The cost varies (3,10,20+); the better the ability, the more it demands. And if you think there's some magic ichor recharging bottle, sorry to disappoint: you'll have to sweat for it. There are two ways to regain ichor: the simple way - basic attacks that drain enemy blood and slowly recharge your ichor supply. Or the chad way - backstab/parry enemies, giving you a large quantity of ichor instantly while simultaniously inflicting massive damage. Plus, this is the only way to increase your max ichor capacity. While this may seem insignificant, ichor capacity varies by blood code; Those more melee-focused (e.g. berserker) have low reserves, unlike their caster brethren. So using those fancy abilities is impossible if thou is not a true chad.Speaking of blood, each blood veil, or armour in laymen's terms, has a stat that affects your succ. The higher it is, the more blood your enemies volunteer to you. Blood veils can also change your parry animation and are the root for magic scaling, because just like blood codes, they have self-imposed fixed stats, as well. Thus, they impact the buffs for dark and light magic. They also have specific stat requirements that your chosen blood code needs to meet before you can get your swag on.Class? ✔️Abilities? ✔️Ichor? ✔️Sexy armour? ✔️Then it's time to show off some mad skillz. For that you have twelve slots; Four for passive and eight for active abilities. The active slots are where the fun is. They have shortcut keys assigned, making using multiple abilities mid-combat super easy, barely an inconvenience. And this was such a breath of fresh air from the endless scrolling of the other souls-like games and made combat so enjoyable. But I've yet to speak about weapons. Some are chunky and slow, others lean and mean. But in the end, they all accomplish the same thing - kill. There is a decent variety in both looks and moveset within a certain weapon category. I personally went with swag over practicality. Looking snappy takes precedent over combat efficiency, always!And I saved the best for last - the AI companion. Yes, yes, I can already hear your eye rolls. But please consider this - Shut up! Anyway, it's optional, and I likes it. It didn't make the game a cakewalk, but having my waifu watch my back allowed me to adopt a more proactive approach, unlike the more calculated ones in my previous masochistic solo adventures. Plus, now I do the ganking.However, reckless play will still earn you a trip to the cemetery, especially since locations tend to be tight, restricting your movement. The last area, in particular, will demand your full undivided attention. The bosses felt fair, for the most part. Some I liked; Like the big, fast, aggressive furry. Some I didn't; Like the edgy main baddy. Overall, they were decent and even with a companion by your side, they are no slouches."

Recommended,13.5,"But what's the endgame like you ask? Well, it's good, but...not as good as it could have been. The problem mainly lies with armour customization, as there is none. You can only equip a top. I appreciate all the different kinky weapons on offer and the insane freedom the character creator gives you, so it's sad to see such piss poor armour customization. But you can change your character appearance (not gender) at any moment, free of charge. So that's nice, I guess.And this sense of ""what could have been"" is also embedded in world design. While locations are diverse, they fail to leave a lasting impression. I still remember climbing out of the depths of the catacombs, only to lay my eyes on the Boreal Valley. But here, that moment of pure awe as you take in the scenery is absent. It's just differently coloured city ruins in various biomes, with spiky things shooting up from the depths. It made exploring dull and didn't satiate my Indiana Jones cravings. As for the enemies, I really liked their design. There is plenty of diversity and representation, with many demon races finally getting their five minutes of fame. As for the bosses, I really dig their looks. Could it be that my dig was, perhaps, influenced by most bosses having big sweater stretchers? Indubitably."

There is no singular enemy that when you spot, you know, good times a' comin'. I saw a big chungus looking demon lady that I thought was a mini-boss until I saw her cousin down the road. Definitely something the sequel should fix.There you have it folks! Code Vein is awesome. I went in expecting a semi-decent Souls clone with an anime aesthetic slapped on top. But I was wrong. It's far more than a mere clone; It's a stellar ARPG that's more than capable of holding its own against any of the heavy hitters, even surpassing them in certain aspects.

Recommended,98.2,"																So, my idiot self bought this game, because I thought it was going to be some fun, regular anime game similar to the SAO games, or something similar. Boy, was I wrong. When I first discovered that the game was going to be a tooth and nail struggle to not get waffle stomped by enemies either twice my size, or twice the size of my house: I quickly learned that I had just spent $80 on a game that I had absolutely no business, or interest in the combat. But, I kept with it, because, well- $80 is a lot of money, and I didn't want to waste it. I had really enjoyed the story, graphics, and I found that screwing around sometimes could be fun. After my first playthrough, which was around 24 hours, I realised that I was supposed to do something very important, and I didn't. So, I cut my losses, and decided to go for another round of butt-kicking torment, but on the first star difficulty. So, I then spent around 13 hours of getting my butt kicked, smacked (not in a fun way), and even bitten by some enemies. During my second playthrough, I appreciated more, and had more 'fun' (if you can call rage inducing bosses, complete with a kit to challenge my brutal stupidity fun) and I was able to get the ending that I wanted. But, after loading back into my save, I realised I didn't want another challenge, I wanted more of the same; I wanted fresh story, and new things to make the game fun. But, that wasn't there. I had purchased the season pass, and I was sorely upset by it. The DLC are shallow, and only really serve a purpose to challenge you, which I can understand some might like, but I don't. Overall, I'd say the game is absolutely worth playing, if you can stomach a few fights that may take north of half an hour of retries. The story was solid, the characters felt resourceful, and aided the narrative, and the levels of customisation on the aesthetics and play style variety (I played the Halberd :)) really made me feel that what I was playing was worth the $80, even if I had spent under 40 hours total in the game. So, if you're looking for a Souls-Like, and you're willing to wear your weeb-badge with pride: I'd absolutely give the base game a try, but I wouldn't say to purchase the DLC, unless you want the added challenges, and you want to support the developers.

Recommended,30.8,"																Sorry for any errors in grammar or misspelled words I have dyslexia and most of the times choose not to write reviews.      I personally like this game; I would go as far as to say I love this game and playing solo makes it a challenge, but it does have its drawbacks. Take for example its parring system which is weird and nothing like other souls-like games and it’s a little hard to get used to it. I found myself using the guard function most of the times another thing is the AI , yes the AI can be a little annoying with their dialog when exploring and sometimes they do get in the way of some boss battles and end up dying within a few seconds or minutes but overall the AI is okay and you always have the option to not take a partner or just summon a friend. The boss battles were for the most part good not great, even the first couple of bosses felt too easy and were a little disappointing but it gets better when you reach the mid-point, well a little before the mid-point. The flexible class system makes this game unique and a lot more interesting, refreshing not to mention with god-tier character creation which you could spend a while making the perfect character. The story is great but by no means is it awesome on that note the story is very narrative driven, but the only drawback is the anime tropes which if you watch a lot of anime like me will feel like a bunch of anime moments with cliché lines. Characters do fill many anime inspired archetypes and so do many themes and situations in the game. That being the case the story is fun and interesting.			"

I haven't seen a single repeated appearance or exact build apart from people pursuing the metas for maximum farming capabilities. It's comfortable and fresh.I'll end up adding more to this at a later date, but this game is excellent. It has a fantastic story, the characters actually feel quite pleasant as the story unfolds, and the fanservice doesn't actually overwhelm the characters themselves.

Recommended,79.7,"																Honestly, this is my favourite game I've played for a while, so I may as well do this. I'll try to answer some questions I've seen people ask when they consider getting into it. Difficulty- It's not that difficult for a Soulslike, but if you're not used to that style of gameplay you might be in for a bit of a learning curve. - Most people find that particular bosses are a lot more difficult than others. I beat some of the bosses in one attempt and others took dozens. - Sometimes you can figure out gift (ability) combos that cheese the boss easily, especially with a partner. - In terms of exploring, there's one area that's particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the rest are a lot more straightforward. - Part of the experience is the satisfaction at beating a tough challenge, in my personal opinion. If you don't find it rewarding to try something either repeatedly to learn patterns or from various angles to try different strategies, you might not find this game very rewarding. But you could still probably manage to get through it if you like the other elements. Gameplay- It really doesn't feel the same as Dark Souls, besides having the same basic mechanics. You won't get significantly better at Dark Souls after playing this game unless this was your introduction to reflex-based games and you improved your reaction time. - It's not grindy. In fact, overlevelling can be slightly detrimental (but not as much as some people make it out to be). The main focus is finding a good build with your gifts (abilities) and upgrading your weapon and blood veil (gear) in different ways that fit your playstyle. - Your core gameplay loop is always the same throughout the game, but there's actually a lot of variation as to how you can play. Rushing in and trying to deplete the enemy's HP within a literal minute versus kiting them with venom - it can feel very different, and it's the most fun if you try every different style, in my opinion. - The game likes to reward completionists, as it seems, so be sure to explore every area if you want the best ending (and play through the game a few more times if you want all the endings). They don't seem to want you to rush through things. Plot- People say it's cliché and meme on it for being ""weeb souls"", so be warned that it does have a lot of edgy anime tropes. But if you enjoy those, like me, you'll enjoy the plot too. - I've heard critique that you can pretty much guess the character archetypes as soon as their introductory scenes, but although the characters are indeed somewhat static, they're not too flat as you do uncover hidden sides of them as you discover their backstory through a gameplay mechanic - although, if you're genre-savvy enough, it's true that you may be able to predict them. - The fanservice is mainly in the visual designs of the characters and not their personalities, if that's something worth considering for you. - This may not be strictly plot, but the areas are beautiful and the cutscenes are nicely animated. Seriously, it's a better visual experience than some anime I've watched. Co-op- Co-op is dogwater. I know it's a Soulslike and not meant to be multiplayer, but please, I just want to chill at the home base with my friends. - You cannot play with a friend if you haven't unlocked the area on your end (including on NG+). Or if you've already cleared the boss (Depths don't count, making it the only place you can hang out or farm for Marks of Honour). - There's a hard limit of only two PCs and one NPC companion, so if you have more than one friend who plays this game, you'll have to take turns interacting with each other. - If you're progressing through the whole game with a friend, beating a boss only counts on the host's side, so you'll have to do each area twice. Character Creator- Literally THE best character creator I've ever seen, the eyebrows alone have more options than my futureOverall, I enjoyed this game because it vibed with my personal interests. Maybe if you're a bit like me, you'll enjoy it too.			"
Recommended,30.1,"																IntroductionNow that I have absolutely milked everything this game has to offer, it's time to make a proper review. This is the first game I bought on Steam, so it holds a special place in my heart. However, for a review, my feelings matter less and I have to look at the game in an unbiased view. I haven't played Dark Souls (yet), so I won't be comparing Code Vein to Dark Souls. Instead, I view this title on it's own. New players to Dark Souls in general or to Code Vein, this review is for you.Easily Overlooked Title Code Vein seems to fall victim to the assumption that it nothing more than a Dark Souls clone with anime waifu characters. Although the game takes inspiration from Dark Souls, there is enough that it does differently, and in some areas, much better to really stand out as its own game giving players an experience worth checking out.Character Creation SystemThis is one of the best character creators I have ever seen, it's like Skyrim with all those anime mods you are too shameful to admit using. It has a ton of accessories and whatever ones you pick, you can place them anywhere on your character, with options to reposition and resize it. See the glasses on my avatar? I can place them on my hair just like how I would in real life. You can now engineer your own catgirl/catboy or waifu/husbando.World Building Lacking in Depth The world design is linear, and I don't feel like everything is interconnected. You move from one area to another to progress, only needing to return to a previous area to do side quests or unlock the door to move to to a different area. Some zones don't even make sense as to how they are connected in the world: Home base is totally separated from everything despite being in the same city of Vein. Most areas have the same theme - everything is rusty, old, and falling apart. Only after the fifth area (my favorite area in the game), will everything look better.  It's a bummer that the game takes place in a big city but you can barely explore it or even just one building."

Recommended,6.9,"Your actions don't have as much impact as I'd like them. There's a quest involving you taking a map to an NPC to help them make a shelter. After completion they just reward you and stand there for the rest of the game instead of going to that taking, or even letting you go there. Overall, world building is superficial, instead of a being deeper.Companions Are Your Life Saver One of the best companion AIs I've ever played with. They react and perform even better than some players I met. They aren't a liability and can actually carry you. Going with one will make the game a lot easier, so I suggest going solo if you want a real challenge.Combat is Fun and Fast-paced Code Vein takes inspiration from Dark Souls in these aspects: Stamina-based action, lock-on target camera, and parry and back-stab leave you invincible.What differentiates Code Vein from Dark Souls is its own class and skills system called Blood Code and Gifts, these are what defines your character build. Blood Code is basically a class, with its own attribute distribution and Gifts. The latter are skills, they can be passive, weapon-based or active, with the latter ones requiring Ichor (the equivalent of mana) each time they're performed."

One moment you could be a DPS Halberd glass cannon, the next moment a tank build, blocking 100% of the damage from almost anything comes to you.Weapons Look Cool But Not That Interesting There are five weapon categories in the game, each categories has more than ten varieties. However, there is not much difference between them.For example, the companions' weapons are just a re-color of the regular weapons, there's no unique model that makes them stand out from the rest, some weapons' movesets are just mix and match of the normal ones. There's only one companion's weapon that has a Gift activation when using charged attacks. Some of the weapons dropped from bosses look unique but still have the same moveset as normal ones. There is only one truly unique weapon, in a sense that its own model, exclusive moveset, in just one category, which i think is disappointing, considering there is a total of 74 weapons in the game.Blood Veil is Your Armor and Fashion Style Blood Veil isn't separated pieces like in other RPG games, instead there's only one piece of armor equipped on your character. There are four categories, each has its own charged drain attacks that gain Ichor, parry and back-stab animation. Armors have dyed variants so pick one that suits your clothing, otherwise you can recolor your clothing to suit the Blood Veil."

Recommended,121.2,"Enemies and Bosses: Not Enough ThereThe lack of enemy diversification is one of Code Vein's downsides. The ones you see in the second area are also in the last before the final boss. Most enemies react slowly, so you can walk behind them and chain back-stab with ease, which is something you can do even with the mini bosses. The only enemy in the game that really intrigues me is the Recently Converted Lost, both in design and attack pattern. They genuinely look and sound like revenants who are turning into the Lost and fight like so. They are the same size as you but hit hard and wildly, can detect you while cloaking, do range attack, perform a charged attack much faster and parry you. It's a shame there aren't more enemies like this. Except for the story-related bosses, neither the bosses in the game don't have any backstory about their origin. They have an introduction cutscene, but after defeating them, you continue the story like if they were just another regular enemy, nothing more special, just beefier or prettier. Their designs are either tough big looking monster-guys or tall big sexy monster-ladies. There are only two bosses that I really like because their models aren't either of those, one of them is in the fifth area, the other one is the final boss.Multiplayer Somewhat ActiveThere's only Co-op, no PvP, which is a downside. Surprisingly, there are still few people who play in Co-op mode. During my latest playthrough, I received helps from five different players in just one area, which is unexpected from this game. Not only that, I met some new friends thanks to the Co-op, and had a blast with them. Really recommend playing with friends or finding some strangers to befriend. Underrated SoundtracksDramatic and emotional, especially in important cutscenes; however, still lack diversity. The bosses' theme is the same, even though it is good, hearing the same track again and again can be boring. Main Menu and Code Vein's theme (Memory of the Lost) are 10/10.DLCsOverall really bad for their prices. DLCs are just three extra dungeons with a single side story that isn't relevant, you can skip it and it won't make any impact. New Blood Codes are very powerful in late game. Weapons and Blood Veils added are just recolors, no unique models, some are good, many are indolent. Main bosses' designs are distinctive and outstanding. Only buy DLCs including in Deluxe Edition ON SALE, which is much cheaper and justified considering what they add to the game. Final rating: 7/10Code Vein is a solid game but it could have been much better. Get the Deluxe Edition when it's on sale, you will not regret it. Would you like to know more?

Recommended,16.9,"																So far having beaten the third boss, the game is good. Combat is like a perfect mash of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and God Eater 3. While the controls on keyboard and mouse are not entirely bad like Dark Souls PtDE, unless you are willing to fiddle with the key mapping, I'd suggest a controller. (Side Note: This is reviewing the offline experience, I have not played online yet, and probably won't until I either get to NG+ or become curious enough, so I can't really say anything on that side of the game.)So far here is my pros and cons.Pros:-Fun Combat Systems-A Tutorial-EXTENSIVE Character Creation (took me 30 minutes just sorting through all the options and i'm still going in an tweaking my character every now and then!)-Interesting Story and Characters-YOU HAVE A MAPNeutral:-Season Pass(I put this here because the description on it is vague at the moment, so I'm hoping it is similar to DS3's Ashes of Ariandel/Ringed City pass, plus it is a back-step from God Eater 3's free updates and extra episodes)Cons:-Some Stuttering/Frame Drop Issues-Unreal Engine (texture fade-in during cutscenes)-Partner Chatter Can Become Infuriating-Partner AI Is Sub-Optimal in Boss FightsIn Conclusion:I recommend this game. I am enjoying it, it contains everything I was hoping for and more. While the game does has its downfalls, I am hoping that solutions for what can be fixed do come around. Either way, I will be playing this game and continue to enjoy it and I hope that anyone who buys it enjoys it as much as I am.			"

Recommended,27.6,"																Code Vein. Relevant for the Steam version of the game. The absolute majority of the game was completed in a co-op with my homeboy.Cons:- Atrocious tutorial, which immediately dumps an enormous amount of information on the player, but at least gives you an opportunity to test everything in the process. Thankfully you can return to the tutorial later on and read text notes about how things work, nonetheless such an introduction to the basic abilities is unacceptable for a 2019 game.- You're very likely to get lost in a few locations.Neuter:• Just another soulslike with all the usual suspects: bosses, shortcuts, bonfires (mistles), stamina, souls (xp points), etc. You can probably fill in the rest of them by now.• The game's storytelling is far more comprehensible in Code Vein than in other representatives of the subgenre.Pros:+ Without going into confusing in-game terminology, the player can switch between character classes an unlimited number of times on the fly, whenever they want, even during the fight. Not only it creates infinite replay value and opportunities for experimentation with the build, but in general it's nice to have such a wide variety of choices.+ Convenient online co-op, which allows you to summon specific players by setting the same password.+ The combat system is deep thanks to a flexible character class management system. As long as the player fully grasps the nuances of the combat system, the fun is almost guaranteed to be had.+ You can go on a solo journey through the game, or team up with a friend online. You can also bring AI companions with you (both in solo and co-op modes) and they're hella useful: they can single-handedly dismantle the majority of the enemies and, what's really surprising for a souslike, they can also revive you multiple times. There are 7 companions in the game and you can switch between them at the mistles. Some of them are better, others are worse, but each of them makes tangible contributions not only during the fights, but outside of them too: they react to everything that's happening in the world and make their remarks, and thus participate in the storytelling.+ Some abilities are unlocked by collecting certain items and by watching mandatory interactive scenes, which shed light on the past events. This is a rather interesting concept, especially for the fans of the lore and players who get invested in the characters. For those who don't, there is an option to skip these cutscenes with memories entirely.Code Vein is one of the best representatives of the soulslike subgenre with its own story presentation and gameplay features, which unfortunately doesn't make it any less unoriginal. At least give it a shot.Recommendation - use a controller for a better experience.My Telegram channel with full overviews of the games including the games from other platforms (EGS, Playstation).[t.me]My Steam curation page.The Editor.

Recommended,28.1,"																Overall an amazing game that's worth investing your time into.Code Vein uses the typical soulslike formula at its core, but makes many twists and adjustments to it to easily distinguish itself from the standard. To keep this review short, here's a list of positives and negatives based on my experience with the game:+ Deep character customization+ Responsive controls coupled with stable performance+ Creative level design+ Challenging and unique boss fights+ Highly engaging combat with countless options to change and customize your build+ Strong focus on story and character development+ Memorable characters+ Great OST+ Stunning graphical design+ Fun Co-op+/- Limited enemy variety (more emphasis is put on same enemy types wielding different weapons than different enemies wielding a set weapon)- A few bugs and glitches- Co-op is quite unstable at the moment- No option to rewatch cutscenesWhen I first heard of Code Vein I was immediately hooked on it. I was shocked to hear that the release of the game would be delayed by a year. Now, after playing it, I can say with confidence that it was worth waiting all this time. The game is very well polished and I strongly recommend it at full price.To put it into numbers, I would give Code Vein a 9.5/10 Waifus. Give it a shot if you're a fan of soulslike games.			"

Recommended,34.2,"																Anime SoulsWhat else that can describe Code Vein other than that? It's pretty much a Souls-like game but in anime aesthetics and storytelling. In fact, I believe it's the most true to the Souls formula compared to the other games like Nioh and The Surge. Everything that you can expect from a Souls game is here, from the combat system, Souls system, exploration, upgrades, and progression. However, Code Vein fails to achieve the heights of Souls games, especially in terms of combat and exploration. There are tons of bosses in the game, some are great but most of them are just alright. Combat feels weightless at times because you'd need a heavier weapon (and buff) to make enemies stagger more easily. Enemies are varied enough, but they're not great either.That said, this game is also doing its own things. Lots of new system and mechanics are introduced here, such as the drain attacks mechanic according to your blood veil (armor) and various AI partner which can accompany you at all times. The game gets considerably easier with AI partner. Fortunately, you can still play solo if that's what you prefer. There are also a ""class"" system here, and you can switch at any time. Each class has its own gifts (skill) that you can learn and inherent so you can use them on other classes. This leads to huge amount of customization and playing styles. Lastly, I like it that there are lots of cutscenes in this game. It's such a nice change of pace from all the fighting. The story and characters are also interesting and often emotional. They way the game tells the characters stories through memory scenes is also brilliant. They really nailed it.Overall, it's a solid Souls-like game and I'll be there when the sequel arrives.			"

Recommended,44.9,"																This game is a big reason why a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" isn't enough for recommendation. I mean, if you like to make anime characters, the character creator alone is worth the asking price. The game itself is rather complicated. It has a number of wonderful ideas. The blood code system needs to be iterated on. There is definitely a phenomenal game that uses this sort of class/stat change on sight mechanic. Giving NPC helpers as difficulty adjusters was also a great idea. The issue is in the execution. For example: healing. Healing in this game comes from one of three sources: regen items, other player's abilities, and self abilities. The abilities either can only heal others directly, or require conditions to work. They tend to also come mid to late game. This means that for a lot of the game, you'll be relying on the regen items. They are slow to use, and do not heal very much. This is a necessity. If they were better, having an npc partner would make the game trivial. However, it makes solo play incredibly frustrating. Getting off a heal is difficult and not very rewarding. Generally, it involves breaking the flow of combat to run away and heal at a distance. So, as long as you are a pro gamer and are doing well, the game's healing system doesn't get in the way of the action. If you get hit it quickly spirals the fight. There are a million little knock on effects like this that plague the game. Ideas that individually make sense, but get very draining very quickly in the actual game. From deceptively wide sweeping attacks to janky backstabs, everything feels uncertain in a way that doesn't gel with this style of game. That said, there are large swathes of the game where these issues die down some, and we can see what Code Vein was attempting. It can get REALLY good at some points. Typically, the knight enemies are interesting and enjoyable. There are whole levels where they shun those awful bug enemies out of the way and just let you have fun for a bit. Honestly, this whole game feels like a rough draft. While I'm only lukewarm on Code Vein itself, I am very intrigued for a sequel. If you like Souls games, I can't promise this one will enamor you, but you'll at least get something out of it.			"
Recommended,57.8,"																 Feel free to follow my review page!The gist of it:Code Vein is exactly what you expect from an anime-souls game: dramatic characters, huge boobs, the power of friendship and souls-like combat. 👍 The good parts:+The combat as expected from this particular genre is pretty good.+The soundtrack is shockingly of high quality. +Huge amount of skills to pick from.+Anime boobs.👎The bad parts:-Level design is a bit boring.-Generic friendly anime story.-Weapons and armors are very underwhelming.StoryCode Vein starts as a mysterious as any souls game but eventually reveals itself to be just another anime show you've seen quite a dozen times. You're basically a revenant or what we know as vampires, and you're all stuck in huge blocked off zone filled with other creatures like yourself and the Lost, which are corrupt versions of the revenants. As you progress you meet several generic characters, the guy that acts a leader, the tough guy of the group who is actually quite emotional, the hot babe, the no tits babe who is tough but has given up that life, etc. and you slowly uncover that you're quite the ""chosen one"" of this story and not some generic custom character and you have the power to save everyone. That would be the simple version of the whole thing, obviously, there's going to be some character development as it is the case with jrpg's but this is done through an interesting mechanic which is vestiges. These are memories of the characters you may or may not meet and you explore them to uncover their past since when a revenant dies and revives they lose a few their memories. It's certainly not a bad story, but it is a wasted opportunity as this had the potential to be a very dark tale but instead, they opted for fan service and the generic power of loss and friendship. Yay! Story rating: 7/10GameplayA souls-like game needs to have meaty, brutal and satisfactory combat and Code Vein to a degree offers that but at the same time far from what I'd call brutal. For the story's sake, you do not play alone and the various companions you pick to bring with you are quite powerful and can also revive you, assuming they have health. The game was designed with this in mind because if you choose to go solo and you enjoy grinding a lot to be way overleved than what a normal playthrough would be, then playing with a companion is a bit easier than any souls-like game I've played. It's a 30-hour game as it is and honestly it's nothing special to make it worth grinding and wasting time playing alone. It's enough challenging with a companion as well. Only recommended for truly obsessed fans. Now you might be wondering what does Code Vein offer in the souls-like genre that we have not seen? Well, it's a skill-based souls game more than just pure combat. As you progress through the game you uncover and unlock blood codes. These blood codes are the classes of the game and each one offers unique skills suited for it and different stats, for example, you can be a dexterity and spells based character or maybe you just want pure combat. There are a lot and each skill is limited to that blood code, however, you can max out the skills with items you find in the game to allow you to use the said skill in any class you want offering an even bigger variety. My only problem with this was that even though you have so many skills to use, you can only use 8 active skills and 4 passives. While the game does offer a huge variety of skills and classes it sadly sucks at weapon and armor variety. In my 30 hours of gameplay, I used exactly 2 armors and 2 different weapons. I just did not like anything else nor did I find anything better than what you can get from your companions. I'm not an expert at the game but your companions weapons you can get by gifting them stuff, seem to be the best ones from the game assuming you upgrade them to the max. It really never felt satisfying exploring the levels because you will never find any worthy weapons or armors hiding somewhere nicely. Gameplay rating: 8/10AudioThe game is fully voiced and I honestly think the Japanese voices were pretty damn good. Unsure if the English dub is good but I don't even recommend playing the game dubbed, it's an anime after all. The sound effects and everything else related to them are decent and nothing really worth discussing about. The big surprise of the audio design was the soundtrack. It is incredibly well crafted from dramatic music to epic choral songs. It feels like they spent more money on the music than the game itself. Audio rating: 8/10Graphics, performance and tech analysisTechnically the game runs perfect, and I had very few bugs in my playthrough. There are some issues in certain zones with the running animations feeling like you're just walking on a treadmill and the overall quality of the animations are a bit stiffy or janky but overall the game is fine. The level design is a bit boring offering only in certain zones a fake sense of maze-like dungeon when ultimately it's just tedious pathing just of the sake of increasing game length. I expected the atmosphere from previews to be quite ugly but honestly, it's not that bad. Nothing really great either and some zones are sadly rip-offs from other games but ultimately they are varied and ok at best.Graphics, performance and tech analysis score:  7/10Conclusion The gist of it is if you love anime and the souls-like combat, this is surely a buy, however, if you're like me and you're probably not impressed by the generic tropes of animes or jrpg's but you love the souls-like combat then get it on any sale. It may lack in its atmosphere and story design but it does make up for it in combat and audio.  Final score: 7.5/10			"

Recommended,22.6,"																Casualized Dark Souls for the ""Anime"" crowdThis game had potential, it really did. But it's just not a Dark Souls game.Dark Souls is about exploring a smoothly interconnected environment with tons of boss variety, secrets, and unique playthrough variance to where every person you ask had a different gameplay experience.Code VeinIs a watered down """"souls-like experience"""" that put more emphasis on cutscenes telling a story through hundreds of flashbacks, than you learning through gameplay and environment about what happened to these broken ruins of a city infested by mindless vampire dredges.There is not a single Illusory Wall in this entire game.The story is just plain confusing and uninteresting.It's an anime game, I get it: Teamwork and the Power of Friendship are a requirement, but did we really have to have a sob story for EVERY character in this game?This game is disgustingly cringey. and I don't use that word lightly here.Every cutscene has you slow-walking through exposition, with long pauses and completely insincere voice-acting, all tied up nicely with a camera pan into the sunset. And to top it all off: You have no clue what these guys are talking about.A new villain is introduced nearly every area, just to be defeated and introduce another one-off villain for the next hour of gameplay. It's EVERYWHERE with it's story, trying to cover as many bases as it can for it to grab your attention, but by the end of the game, you probably already forgot about ""Random Girl you rescued who sits in the base for the entire game and doesn't do anything"". In fact, if you are expecting anything from the story, you're going to be REALLY disappointed, from lore AND gameplay.For a new IP, it did a phenomenal job with building its world. Walking through the post-apocalyptic ""vampire"" world at the beginning feels grand. Giant collapsed buildings blocking your path, enemies using cars as blockades, giant vampire spikes impaling most architecture, it's rad as heck. Until it goes into generic ""ice level"", ""fire level"", ""desert level"", and everyone's most hated zone in the game, ""Giant 3-hour long maze level"". (I had to do this area 4 times and it physically hurts me to LOOK at this zone now.)Gameplay-wise...It's alright. The main appeal of the game is to play as your favorite anime loli because the character creator is FLIPPIN FANTASTIC. The other main appeal is being able to freely switch between specs, talents, and steal spells from other specs to become your own weird ""vampire"" hybrid class type.Every level is basically a straight line with some branching paths that lead to dead-ends, so you always go back to that straight line. It's hilariously bland for exploration. Item pickups are worthless, item upgrades feel weak, new class types are worthless 90% of the time, unless you really want to steal a spell from it to perfect your build.On the subject of Code Vein maps, enemy placement is cheap to downright insulting at many points. There are many, MANY cases where enemies are directly on the side of doors ready to pounce, or small alcoves with little reaction time to attack back. It's just plain cheap enemy placement.Enemy variety is seriously lacking in this game. Seriously. Because the main evil is ""vampires who have turned"", every enemy is humanoid. If you're familiar with Dark Souls (mostly 2), you are extremely familiar with every single attack these guys will throw out with a sword, spear, and greatsword. It's boring fighting these guys 100% throughout the game, and there's like 10 enemy types total. This is the main downside to this being ""an anime game"".It does an alright job at emulating Dark Souls combat, but I understand it's NOT Dark Souls. It's a LOT faster paced and WAY more punishing in the lategame. Bosses are incredibly punishing, like even the first boss oneshots you with blinding speed. This is balanced by you having a permanent companion to take aggro for you, so you can heal back up freely at any time. Because of this companion you keep forever throughout the game, it makes nearly every scenario and boss really easy for the entirety of the game. If you have any doubts about this, I'll let you know that your partner can straight up revive you on a 10 second cooldown. Dark Souls? Punishing but fair.Code Vein? Punishing and unfair, due to circumstances that make it borderline unfair, like broken build paths and you have a teammate at all times. Many things will stunlock you to death on this adventure.It's somehow too easy and too difficult at the same time, which is a glaring balance issue. The DLC bosses are straight up insane.Speaking of lategame: The lategame is (non-randomized) little mini-dungeons that have 2 paths and a boss so you can grind mats. It's incredibly underwhelming and feels like an hour-sink to inflate game playtime.The co-op is dead btw. There are no invasions, just co-op. Nobody will see your awesome character you spent 2 hours making.(Which makes a certain achievement for getting 400 co-op helper coins take a WHOLE lot more 20 hour grind-y.)Whatever you do: Don't buy the DLCSeriously. Don't. It's awful, lasts probably 10 minutes per zone, and has a super-hard boss with little mini-achievements for more unlockable gear and specs. It's just not worth your time. Seriously, just buy the base game. I'm really serious about this one. Stick to the base game, which I would recommend at a solid $20-25 (on sale).""Then why did you give the game a positive review if there's so much bad about it?""Because I understand that it's not Dark Souls and it's its own attempt at being something else. Is it a bad game? No not at all, I got burnt out about 20 hours in. It's a good standalone game and if you keep comparing it to Dark Souls you're going to stop enjoying it. Just take it at face value, because that's what you should do to all games.In all honesty, I would play a Code Vein 2 if they release one. The base game itself has much potential to be a great game if built upon in the future of the series. It was not a ""bad game"" by any means.			"
Recommended,103,"																Let me keep this uncharacteristically short. Do I recommend Code Vein? Yes, but that comes with a caveat and a warning. First the caveat, you're going to want an SSD, performance wise the game runs like greased lightning on even older GPUs and CPUs,  but that comes at the cost of minutes long load times on HDDs with loading going both in and out of cut scenes, this will quickly become an annoyance. Second, the warning, the game has a good, ostensibly cannon ending that only completionists will discover on their first go.  Gather all of the shards before fighting the boss, then after the boss but before leaving their memories, USE their statue, you have to remember to do this for EVERY BOSS, you ALSO have to collect ALL Eos shards, and do their cut scenes with Io before the final boss.Edit: As a newbie to the ""Souls"" style I didn't have much experience with others before writing the initial review. Having now taken shots at all 3 Dark Souls games in the last few months, I'd say Code Vein is very much ""beginner's Dark Souls"". In every way it's more forgiving without making the game outright trivial, and assuming you're building out your gear to match, you will easily clear the campaign with only the DLC Super bosses (which are only ""super"" in terms of being much more like a real Dark Souls boss) to give you any REAL trouble.

Recommended,177.5,"																I played this game for 14 or so hours before finding it boring. I really couldn't put my finger on why I wouldn't like it, it had similar item, combat, and enemy systems to Dark souls and Bloodborne. I thought about it alot, and the story was great, it was solid story, so that wasn't it. The items were awesome too, you had great stuff in that department. The enemies were diverse and very not ridiculous in their mechanics. So what was it? The answer surprised me. Combat. I looked back on it awhile, and I finally figured out that what was wrong was the combat. The single most important aspect of the game was botched. How you might ask? Combat was unsatisfying, and when I say that I mean that when you hit something, it didn't feel like you were hitting something. It felt more like you were spamming an attack to get rid of an nuisance rather than fighting for your life against something. Enemies didn't stagger or feel like they were being hit at all most of the time, and what's more, this translated to almost everything besides the weakest of enemies. It felt more like I was hitting an animated doll rather than a thinking enemy, which is a surface level in most things like this, but it matters significantly.			"
Recommended,160.3,"																After getting 100% Achievements, Max level, mastering all Blood Codes I am safe to say this game is absolutely worth getting.Game has right aesthetics and gives that immersive feeling, quite similiar to other souls-like games but still in it's own interesting taste. It's indeed a blast.Storywise, isn't so deep to question your own existence after finishing true ending, but definetely good enough.Soundtrack is probably my favorite thing. Thanks to this I am always stuck in main menu for quite a while.Characters aren't unusual looking early in the game, but as story progresses, you get to know their lovely backstory. At that point you realise, their past is quite fascinating ^^.Oh, and enormous character creation ? Yes. They got it.10/10, get it for Mia's sake.			"

Recommended,280.3,"																Code Vein: ""A weeb's first Dark Souls"".(at least that was my case lmao)Pros: - Good story, kinda rushed at times but it's fine. - Great characters, nice nakamas and amazing waifus. You don't have a relationship system as games like Persona, but hey, at least you can give them gifts and take them with you to kick some ass. - BIG ANIME TITTIES (I had to mention it, sorry), - Outstanding character creation tool, the only bad thing was the lack of costumes to choose but in every other aspect it is perfect, I legit wasted like 3 hours just making a male and a female character. - Great progression system and gameplay, really entertaining, it success at making you want to keep going. - Good difficulty, it feels good to beat someone who killed you,  doesn't it?. Some bosses are reaaally easy, while others kill you in like 3-hits, and the thing is, you'll never know once you try, so it's a good way to make players be always prepared for battle. - Good graphics, pretty standard for Bandai Namco games powered by Unreal, if you have played other games like Good Eater or anything SAO then you know what I'm refering to. They aren't the best, but work perfect for anime style games.Cons: - ""Level"" based game, you enter a new area, go from point A to point B and that's it, on to the next area you go! it feels really repetitive, there is practically nothing else to explore in an area other than the main road, secrets are damn easy to find. - Partners IA, man, I died SO MANY TIMES because of how poorly the partners react, sometimes they die 1-hit for no reason, and they can revive you if they have a good amount of life left, aren't on cooldown and aren't attacking/being attacked, yet many, maaany times they didn't revived me, legit, they stop moving looking at you and say something like ""Sorry, I couldn't help..."" while they see you die slowly, they have everything ready to help you, yet they don't do ♥♥♥♥ just because the game decided to delete their artificial brain cells lmao, that maked me angry af.-  Presentation, while I sayd the graphics are ok, and the custences are great too, the in-game dialog sections have trash animation, characteds standing still looking at each other lifeless and without making any movement, many times they don't even use their mouth, those moments feel so damn cheap its sad. - Post-game content, there is none, you can go explore the ""Depths"" but if you are like me and really want to get stronger to progress throught the game most likely you will have beaten those areas  the moment you get them, letting you without anything to do. There are 3 DLC depths areas that are just that, 3 more areas, short and pointless areas. If you beated the game, finished every Depth area and got every Vestige, you can play the story again in a ""New Game+"" so you can try and obtain a different ending, but just that... the main post-game content is supossed to be the online multiplayer, but... - Multiplayer, it sucks. How does it work? you can help people in an area they haven't beated yet, so, let's say you have a friend and both 100% finished their game, the only way to play together is that one of you do a new run of the game, or to play the same Depths maps over and over again...  oh, yeah, and the MP is ♥♥♥♥ dead, good luck triying to get the rank 30 achievement, you need 400 emblems, wich translate to helping 400 players, nice, don't you love when games that can be perfectly beated offline-only have online related achievements? like, do game creators like Bandai Namco really think the online modes on their games will never die? lmao. - The True Ending, man, it is unfinished af, you want to keep playing but you can't, it's a great way to finish the game, but not the story. - The dialog choices you can make throught the game, they are absolutely pointless sicen they don't change anything on the story, there are 3 different endings yet they have nothing to do with the dialog choices, so, what's really the point?Anyway...I give this game a 8/10 because it was fun and I liked it, that's all, after all, the point is to entertain the player, and it did in my case.MIA CONFIRMED BEST WAIFU 10/10PD: sry if my english ♥♥♥♥ sucks, I don't wanna write a review in Spanish, my native language, and if you get angry for it just stfu lmaooo, this is legit my first review and I'm bored ayyyyyy			"

Recommended,34.2,"																cool game, the cathedral is the worst area in any video game i've ever played.			"
Recommended,11.9,"																Interesting souls-like where fixed classes have been replaced by ""blood codes"", which can be replaced at any moment during the game when not in combat. Each blood code has unique stats (STR, DEX etc) and also a unique set of gifts (=skills and perks). After ""mastering"" these gifts by using them enough, you can use them with other blood codes as well. They way, you can customize your character a lot more than in other souls-likes.There are a few different styles of weapons in the game, including swords, axes, halberts and bayonettes. Especially the latter is interesting, because you can actually fire a bullet as well. Weapons can (temporary) be infused with different kinds of damage (stun, poison, ice etc), making them more effective against certain types of enemies and bosses. Nice thing is that weapon infusion increases resistance against this type of damage as well. The combat is good. Not ""From Software"" perfect, but lots of fun nevertheless. The difficulty isn't too hard. You're being accompanied by an AI partner all the time, which gives you time to heal when health is low. Some of the boss fights are really frustrating though, mostly because your AI partner dies too soon or because the boss has attacks with a huge range that are hard to predict. Beating these bosses felt more luck than skill to me.The most significant issue I have with this game is the story telling: the story is mediocre and the characters and cut scenes are very boring. There's also the monotone level design. Most of the levels barely have variation in textures and colors, making them extremely boring to explore. This is a huge disappointment after playing the Souls games with their impressive level design. You're also fighting the same enemies over and over again, once again something that From Software does so much better.Despite these issues, Code Vein is definitely worth playing if you're a fan of Souls-like games.			"
Recommended,13.2,"																   Dark Souls: re       Story and the World of Code Vein  Code Vein is a souls-like game that sets place in a post-apocalyptic world that has anime aesthetics. You're a revenant that lost her/his memories and is trapped in a dome that unknown horrors to the outer world. Revenants are like vampires or like Ghouls from Tokyo Ghoul that need blood to survive and who are immortal and can be reborn (This is the excuse for our resurrection gimmicks). We wake up next to a girl and we're thrown into this unknown world with her after being captured to hunt for blood sources called ""Blood Beads"". On our journey, we meet other revenants and try to find a way to stop the horrors inside the dome. (I don't want to spoil the game since it's basically like an anime)  Character Creation and the Main Protagonist  Most people will love this game for its character creation menu since you can create ANYONE if you have the time and put the effort in. This sadly doesn't get your character to speak although you have to choose a voice for the pain to inflict noises and dying sound effects. Our character is at the center of the story so they at least try to act like they matter for the most part but the head nodding and facial expressions still don't cut it considering that this game has a story that could be of an animes.   Characters   Code Vein has your generic anime characters with decent writing behind them. You won't get attached to them that much but they are there to keep you invested in the story. Although I liked most characters like Io, Eva, and Louis. Some characters were truly annoying, to say the least. (That little brother dude was a really bad one and the ""onigiri dialogue with Yakumo was cringy)  Gameplay  Compared to Dark Souls, Code Vein falls short with combat but knows how to pick it up with ""Blood Codes"" these are your classes that affect your play style. They have active and passive perks which you can use with other codes if you master them. I was interested in codes overall but after you get a specific code other codes don't matter because sadly there's a code that's too powerful compared to others. Enemies are your Dark Souls enemies with one or two different enemy types. As an example, there's a yeti-like monster that can roll tank your hits, and can throw objects which makes him 3 in 1 package. I liked the enemies overall and their art style was great. This game offers side quests too but since there's a map when you pick up the side quest it shows you what to do and side quests are weaker than Ubisoft ones. Other than that this game offers small dungeons where you 2-3 bigger versions of the normal enemies and then you fight an in-game boss, they're pretty ""ok"" to quench your hunger if you want more Code Vein. Weapons are your basic weapons with one-handed swords, two-handed swords, halberds and there's a new type called bayonet. Each one of the weapon types is cool but dual-wielded swords are still too ""OP"". Bayonets can shoot and slash making it an interesting weapon to use and fun. Swords are still the same but as I've said before active abilities add a ton to the gameplay and add new attacks and styles for the weapons. Great gameplay overall.   Bosses  I have to open up a new section for this because there's a lot to talk about here. I loved the bosses of this game. This game was probably made by interns at Bandai Namco who loved their jobs because they understand what makes souls-like a good game. From your 2 men bosses to your fast and agile hard to hit bosses this game gets you hooked to your screen... If you don't have a companion. Code Vein offers you a companion NPC that's with you from the start till the end. This creates a weird issue in-game, it makes this game too easy from time to time. The bosses of this game are beautifully designed but they aren't meant for co-op play because if the boss starts to concentrate on your companion you have a huge opening to heal etc. making the game easier. Do not get me wrong I RECOMMEND YOU PLAY WITH A COMPANION ON YOUR FIRST RUN. But if you decide to run a new game try to go solo since it will suit the genre better. My favorite bosses were the Invading Executioner, The Virgin Born (Probably the hardest boss in-game), and the Blade Bearer/Cannoneer duo. There was only one weak boss in my opinion and that was the game's first boss Oliver Collins.   Sound and Music  Code Vein's soundtrack only consists of bangers whether you are fighting or in a cutscene, the music is always there to add more to your experience. Boss fight songs are almost at DS3 levels. Did I tell you that Code Vein is literally like an anime so sad music affects you even for characters you don't care about? Hmm, I think I did. Anyways, gun and enemy sounds are done very well and you feel you hit something when your weapon makes contact with the enemy, but sadly the sound of a bayonet sounds fake they should've at least tried to put a bit more effort into a gun that's new in the genre.Story 7.5/10Characters 8/10Level Design 7/10Gameplay 8.5/10Sound 9/10Art Design 7/10Bosses 9.5/10Personel Enjoyment 9/10 65.5/80 Phantom Points  81,875/100 (Phantom Point scaling should be done from a base of hundred because every game will have different aspects)   Conclusion and Final Words   Code Vein is a great game that tries new things in its way and succeeds. Whether you're interested in anime aesthetics or souls games, I highly recommend Code Vein.Hi, this was my first detailed review and I wanted to inform you guys about the game and what I experienced.

Recommended,40.4,"																Code Vein is a mix of God Eater and Dark Souls with great music composed by Shiina Go.

However, it is not unplayable by any means.The Good:+Boss and enemy designs are great, +Character Creation is phenomenal,+Unique skill system unlocked by gaining allies and finding memory shards,+Beautiful graphics and atmosphere (especially Sacred Blood Catherdal a.k.a Vampire Anor Londo)The Neutral:*Story is not bad and some moments are badass ((Jack vs The Gang)) but its not great either.The Bad:-Some bosses have cheap insta-kill attacks and are just unfair,-Companions except Yakumo die instantly to endgame bosses and are useless after mid-game,-Underground, dungeon-like areas are boringDLC:Do not buy them.Conclusion:The game offers great fun for both Anime and Souls fans alike, While some parts are repetitive and boring, there are enough moments that will make up for that.

Recommended,35.8,"																When I first went into Code Vein, I had been expecting Dark Souls with an anime skin over it, but I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised to find it an experience that, while still taking notably from the Souls series, comes into its own as a game. While initially I had a rough time with the fluidity, I soon got into the groove, and the game took off from there. Certainly worth my purchase, and I am hopeful for the DLC and a potential sequel.

Recommended,47.8,"																Is it a Dark Souls Clone?Honestly, this game is more than that. While it has a lot of inspiring features that relates to Dark Souls (and Bloodborne), Code Vein does a great job being distinct enough to feel like it's own game.StoryThe main story is quite engaging. It isn't too deep and doesn't really leave you with many questions but it does a fine job. Sometimes the game will spoon feed you details rather than being like Dark Souls where you have to find the answers about the world and the lore itself. Nether the less, I really liked it and gave our character a reason to try resolving the conflict while in Dark Souls, it's kind of up to the player's imagination as to why they should care.CombatYou'll notice right away that it feels a bit clunky, and not as polished or sooth as Dark Souls. But, to make up for this, it offers us a huge load of abilities that you can access through Blood Codes. You unlock them by either doing the story, finding them around the world, or befriending NPCs. Either way, the amount of spells / passives / abilities is remarkable, and as you progress through the game, the uniqueness to your playstyle could be limitless. It also has some of the sickest backstabs / parry animations i've seen in a game, and I never grow tired of watching them. They change up depending on what armor / clothing you're wearing called a Blood Veil.Character CreationAbsolutely the best thing about Code Vein. Hardly any other game comes close in the vast amount of options you can choose in customizing your character. While it does lack certain features like making your character fat, or adjusting the cheeks, and other bits; there are thousands and I mean, an insane amount of things you can do with how the eyes look, the hair, the coloring of your hair, the accessories being there without you needing to pay for them- it's amazing. I'm pretty sure it will take anyone an hour or two just messing around with the character creation, and it's addicting to use as well.NPCS / AIWhat this game does in my opinion, far better than what either any Dark Souls game or Bloodborne did ... was give us incredible characters. Every single NPC is unique, likable, developed, and are a big influence on my joy of the game. Not to mention the best part is, they're actually great in combat. Their AI isn't poorly done, they can sometimes even carry you through a hard fight depending on who you're bringing and what the boss is. Not to mention you can collect what's called Vestiges and see memories. These made me care so much about the characters I was working with, and gave me a reason to bother doing their side quests. Also, Io is hands down the best waifu. No exceptions.Co-OpReally easy to find someone online and play with. Every person I got with was fun to engage with, spamming emotes and posing for kicks. The boss fights felt way more entertaining because we got to sync our abilities together with all sorts of flashy plays. This game did an excellent job making it worth co-oping with people online and your friends.Scenery / EnvironmentsPretty basic and bland. What hurts this game is how generic and uninspiring the layouts of the world are. They're cool in a way, but it gets old fast and I don't really remember a single location that made me appreciate the atmosphere. It's not bad, but it could of been way better.MusicOnly a very few songs caught my attention. Most of it is also generic and not that interesting. Even the basic sounds are, kind of annoying to be honest. With that said, some of the songs that do catch your attention are fantastic.VerdictThis game is great, with some glaring problems. While I had no care for the world and the settings because they were so bland, the characters, combat, fighting mechanics, memories to witness, bosses, and the character creation all make up for it big time. Totally replayable too, with multiple endings to earn. This game to me is a solid 7.8 / 10 and is worth the money. I love it, and will continue playing it.			"
Recommended,331.5,"																(Another example of why Steam should have a Neutral option.)It's a Souls-like game in every way of the word (there's even an Anor Londo area, for Christ's sake).There are some differences though:- you can change your class (called Blood Code) whenever you want, and you can mix and match a lot of things- you have an AI companion that fights alongside you; you can choose from a few different companions or you can dismiss them and play on your own; the game seems to be balanced around coop, though Story part of the world is engulfed in a red mist (Boletaria, anyone?) and inside it some monsters appeared; to battle the monsters, scientists awoke the dead, turning them into Revenants, which causes them to lose much of their memories; Revenants always ""respawn"" after death, unless their heart is destroyed; the Revenants also crave human blood, kind of like vampires; if they don't feed, then they frenzy and become mindless Lost (like the Curse of the Undead);it's not a very complex story, but it gets the job done, I guess Level Design I've seen people praise the LD, and, for the life of me, I can't understand why;while it's not terrible, and it has some interesting exploration and shortcuts, the game is very bland; there are a lot of long, empty corridors, especially when you transition from one area to another; they could've beautified many of the areas a bit, tell stories through LD; but no, instead, you get many long corridors with a few bits of rubble from time to time; not sure if it's a matter of padding the length of the game or it helps loading the next area; as an added example, the elevator ride to the final boss takes about 45 seconds for no reason (thankfully, there's a bonfire after that);also, some levels are a nightmare to navigate, especially the Anor Londo clone, which is like a maze; Gameplay - like I said, you can change your class at any time, and that is this game's biggest strength;want to wield a Zweihander but also cast spells? sure, you can do that, though it might take some fiddling with your Gifts and Blood Veil;there are 32 Blood Codes (classes), and each of them has a few Gifts;Active Gifts are either spells, weapon attacks (skills) or buffs, and you can equip 8 of them; there are also Passive Gifts, and you can equip 4 of them; if you kill a few enemies, your equipped Gifts will be inherited, which means they can be used with other Blood Codes, not just the one they belong to;Blood Veils are a sort of outfit that go over your clothes, give you different buffs and resistances and also change your backstab and parry animations; they are kind of like armor sets in other games; there are 4 types of Blood Veils and each type has a few sub-type of different designs, with slightly different attributes;like I said, A LOT of combinations- other than that, it's your standard Souls experience: stamina bar, equipment weight that affects stamina usage, bonfires, resurrect after death, upgrade weapons and armor- bosses are pretty standard; there's no stand-out boss among them;a cool thing though, is that, after you defeat them, you can kill them for good or ""purify"" them; this only works for a few bosses, which are friends of some of your companions; a not so cool thing is that the companions don't do anything different either way; it would have been nice if they'd gain a bonus or give you a reward for saving their friends;of course there's an Ornstein&Smough fight, and it's even more frustrating than the original;- there's also Coop, but I've played this game about a year after release so I doubt there's anybody else playing; from what I've read, if you have an AI companion and you summon a Coop partner, the AI isn't removed/replaced, so you'll have a ""party"" of three- this game is quite difficult to play Solo (without the AI companion);because it was designed with this feature in mind, (some) bosses are extremely aggressive, so much so that you won't even have time to heal;if you play with a companion they sometimes take the aggro and then you get a moment's respite, to heal and get your stamina back, maybe even buff yourself;IMO, bosses should have had a different AI ruleset if you're playing solo, with longer cooldowns between attacks; Character Customization this is one of the best character creator I've seen in any game; you have a huge selection of face/body customization options; unfortunately, there are only 8 (IIRC) outfits to choose from, but you can add some extra items (like pouches, angel wings, bracelets, animal tails etc.) and you can change the colors of pretty much every clothing article;All in all, it's a decent game, but it's not worth $60.

Recommended,67.2,"																TL;DR Pros/Cons [pros for some, cons for others]+/- (I believe) is generally easier than Dank Souls+/- ""Anime"" graphics, stories, and voice actingPros+ Vast and flexible character customization, classes, and skills that can be changed on the go, as you play+ Pretty good ""Anime"" story imo, with a soft twist here and there+ Fun and Challenging map clearance. You will need coffee AND energy drink once you reached the map Cathedral of the Sacred Blood in order to stay sane.+ WaifusCons- Multiplayer could have been better. Also, limited fanbase made it even harder to find any signal (at least for my region)- Not-so-easy-to-understand Weapon & Armor system; how they scale, their ""transform weapon/armor"" system, how elemental damage stacks and/or deals damage, etc. (could be just me that was too dumb but i'll still put it as a con) - 1 persistent bug in NPC trades that hasn't been resolved as of early February, where you will get stuck and need to restart the game. (I'm just being nitpicky, this could be avoided. Just search NPC Exchange bug) People often compares this game with the Dark Souls series. I have to agree and can definitely see the similarities, but for some people, comparing it might just hurts you because of the over-expectation of the souls-like game and therefore failed to judge CODE VEIN for the game itself. So let's set that aside.I have never played any Dark Souls series, nor any hardcore souls-like series game before (at least not the hardcore difficult ones; the Darksiders series is as far as I've played of the similar genre), but I thoroughly enjoyed the game. This game is definitely NOT easy IF you do the game solo (no AI Partner). If you decided to use the AI Partner, however, this game became significantly easier. Mobs can just be defeated by your partner alone with their seemingly unlimited Regeneration potion, and they will just tank/distract the bosses for you while you cheese the bosses' hp. Play however you want, just know that the Partner feature is there.One of my favorite things from playing this is how deep and flexible the classes (Blood Code) are in this game. There are a lot of mix and matching we could do with both active and passive gifts (skills) within the whole 32+2 Blood Code (+1 if you bought the pre-order, and +1 from the season-pass; also gets added several more from all of the incoming DLCs), and the fact that we can change it on the go makes it even better. You could clear the maps as a two-handed sword warrior and proceeds to fight the boss as a dark mage, or just go mobbing full hybrid with one-handed sword + light magic then go pew pew on bosses from range with a bayonet build. It can't get more flexible than that. I am honestly not really a fan of this kind of distress signal type of multiplayer (like the SOS signal in Monster Hunter fashion), but i guess for the type, it's not really bad after i've tried it. Would still have preferred a lobby type of multiplayer like Borderlands style multiplayer where you can play with up to 3~4 players with corresponding difficulty in accordance with players present (or really, just any lobby type of multiplayer), but it's probably just not meant for souls-like game. Nonetheless, my complaint still stand: I personally don't really like this type of multiplayer.Do keep in mind though that because either people have finished playing and have nothing to really keep them to play this on end-game, or because the existing fanbase IS limited in the first place, there may not be that many people that will send distress signal or receive yours when you send one. However, if you want to play with a friend, it's not hard to set up so there's that. The weapon transform system is confusing for me to digest at first. Instead of a direct transformation, it instead just adds increased ""status"" for your gear. Here's a quick example: if you transform a sword with a stun/poison core, it doesnt mean your sword now deals stun/poison damage towards enemies. Instead, your sword deals ""buildup"" stun/poison status against enemies that are not resistant towards it. Which means the enemies will get stunned/poisoned after you hit them several times. Same thing with the armor, stun/poison core added to armor will just decrease the buildup damage the enemies build towards your character (i.e. instead of 3-4 hits, enemies needs 6-7 hits to stun player). This is just one example, there are still many core (also the non-elemental core) that even I still don't know how to properly utilize even until now. I am not the brightest tool in the shed, and that's why I'll put this here for my fellow not-so-bright gamers out thereDid I mention that the character customization in this game is crazy? The amount of character design you can make from this is insane, and also can be changed throughout your playthrough. Although you can't change the character's gender and voice past introduction, you can change the whole design of your character anytime via the Home Base of your character. For anyone who enjoys creating characters, this is definitely a big plus. I've seen many Anime/Manga replica of a character and even more Original masterpiece the forum and reddit had created, and you may be one of them later.Mini addition: you can enter photo modes and fawn over hundreds of filtered screenshots you can take over your waifus character. Who doesn't want to fawn over their cat-ear-bunny-tailed-big-tiddied-vampire waifus?Overall, CODE VEIN is a good Anime-esque ""souls-like"" game that offers vast configuration over your character customization, class, and skills, that are not tied to 1 saves (you can literally edit all 3 on the go). Definitely recommends the game if you don't mind the ""Anime"" part of the game.			"
Recommended,10.7,"																PROS:-Emulates the Soulsborne gameplay style very well-Incredible level of character customization-Cool enemy designsCONS:-Level design is very bland at times-Lots of overdone anime tropes-Bizarre difficulty spikes in a couple places, likely to try to capture that Soulsborne feelIf you're into Soulsborne and anime, this is probably as good of a mix of those two things as you're ever gonna get. The character customization is incredibly impressive, with an absolutely massive amount of ways you can tweak every little aspect of your looks. Gameplay is fun and fluid, and imitates the Soulsborne style far better than any other imitator I've played so far. Visuals are slick and stylish, and the boss designs are generally pretty interesting. If you're a fan of God Eater, there may be something here for you as well. It's a little nauseating with the overdone anime tropes at times, and you'll know they're coming from a mile away, but overall it's not so in your face that it ruins the experience. I generally say ""the less story, the better"" when it comes to Soulslikes, since many of the imitators try to have a deep plot that ends up just being wholly uninteresting, but Code Vein balances it a lot better. There's definitely a storyline here, but it doesn't overstay its welcome at any point and you're still spending most of your time in that nice crunchy gameplay loop. Highly recommended if you're an anime fan looking for something to scratch that Soulsborne itch.			"

Recommended,37,"																It is as what you think it is, Anime Dark Souls. If you hate the fundamentals or mechanics of Dark Souls, this game doesn't do enough different to change your mind on it. Since the game-play is basically Dark Souls but with changing around some variables, not comparing to the original is going to be impossible. I will say right now that the game is definitely worth a playthrough, but there are significant elements that I didn't particularly enjoy. I will also preface this review with a warning that my first playthrough was a long while ago, and my more recent experiences are on NG+.What I thought the game did well:-Character Customization: I think I spent 45 minutes to about an hour exploring all of the options and trying various combinations before I ended up on my first character. It's got a good amount of options, and making at least a semi-decent character isn't hard, at least in my opionion-Graphics: The Anime art style is done really well here. If you don't like the art style, the graphics won't change your mind, but the game can be pretty when it tries.-Story: It's far from award winning, but it was at least decent enough to keep me hooked. There's some really cool moments, but then other times it can be very tropy or basic. It's hard to say more without going into spoilers.-Music: The game is mostly quiet, and the basic battle and pre-battle themes are basic and what you'll hear most of the time. Aside from those themes, the rest of the OST is really good, the boss themes I thought were all exceptional.-Easier Experimentation with Builds: Builds have much lower resource commitment compared to other games in this style. You still have to invest into armor and weapon upgrades like normal. However, you can reallocate your primary stats at almost any time by changing which ""Blood Code"" you can equip, which are kind of like classes in RPG games but not exactly. You start off with 3 of these blood codes and unlock more overtime. Some are a bit tedious or hidden, and some are locked to what you decide at the end of certain boss fights. But it's a concept I can appreciate.-Gift/Magic System: The magic spells in this game are called Gifts. Unlike Dark Souls, you don't need an item to cast them, you can do it at anytime as long as you have ichor, the game's version of mana. Gifts are not just for magic casters, some are designed for ranged/melee players, so that all playstyles benefit from this change. I've enjoyed a hybrid magic melee play-style in souls-like multiple times before, so I felt right at home with this feature.What I was neutral or indifferent on:-The relieving of memories: I initially thought it was cool concept and at least executed decently. However, it gets repetitive after a while and I just found myself going ""What flavor of trauma is on the menu for today?"" when encountering a new set of memories. I think they could have added in more positive memories to mix things up a little, or somehow reduced the number of existing memories -The Environment: a lot of the environments are city textures plastered in different biomes. City. City partially in Water. City on Fire. City in Sand. While the graphics may be good, the repetitiveness of doing this can get old and lead to some areas feeling samey despite having color/tonal differences. It didn't bug me that much but I thought it was worth mentioning.What I didn't like:-Cathedral of Sacred Blood: This is a poorly designed area, and even on NG+ runs for achievements, having the map revealed doesn't really help in navigating this area. A lot of things look the same and it's easy to forget where you're going. It's clear they tried to make this a memorable area but went about it the wrong way. They should've cut out one of three major sections of the map and redo the routing a bit in the remaining two, and the area would have been way better than the current iteration.-The companion (gameplay): I think a lot of my dissatisfaction can be traced to this single design decision. In the Dark Souls formula, an extra body on the side of the player is overpowered just from splitting aggro alone (as long as this extra body doesn't die in seconds). But it gets worse, both you and the companion have the ability to revive each other after death within a few seconds, at the cost of some ichor and health. I was concerned that some frustrating concessions would be made to try to keep the game difficult with this constant AI companion, and this expectation was unfortunately met. I will mention some of them in the next few sections-Hitstun (or lack thereof): Aside from the lowest tier enemies, enemies have high poise. This makes melee combat rather unsatisfactory as you just smack them with your melee weapon and maybe once in a while they'll flinch. There is a gift that does buff hitstun, but it requires a B in Strength so it's not utilizable for some builds. You can get locked out of getting the Blood Code for this Gift in a single new game cycle, so not everyone will have it. I think the Stun status ailment is an alternative, but I never got that much into the Blood codes that give access to it in my first play through. Unless you invest in buffing your hitstun with those abilities, you're best alternative is to minmax your playstyle's damage output and at that point it's just a game of pushing how high your numbers go. This in turn makes weapon choice more linear, as you're more motivated than normal to just pick what deals more damage as opposed to what you like, aesthetically or functionality wise, and that is a mindset I do not really like in this style of gameplay.-Bosses: There are a few good ones, don't get me wrong, but a lot were just frustrating and didn't feel that good to beat. I often encountered that ""I overcame BS"" feeling instead of ""I overcame a great challenge"". Some bosses I felt I just overpowered without really learning the fight. Some boss fights I thought were really good, but then ruined by one or two moves that are just obnoxiously stronger than the rest of their kit that it was head scratching. And then some bosses that just spam AOE and do nothing else interesting because again, you have an AI companion that the boss has to deal with in addition to you. I think there are more bad bosses than good bosses, more than enough to taint the experience, but enough good ones that it wasn't entirely corrupted.-Blood Veils: I like the aesthetic of some of them, and they even give you the option to turn them off if you don't like them. However, I dislike how much is tied to them. Not only are they responsible for your defensive stats, they act as a secondary source of your main stats, and determine what parry and drain animation you have. I hate trying to parry with the spikes/tail, the parry animation feel too slow and almost unusable, which affects certain blood veils that I would otherwise enjoy. I don't understand why it's this way, unless they wanted to do PvP at some-point and it was an attempt to balance said PvP before it got scrapped.-No shields: None of your equipment options give you a physical shield, while plenty of enemies wandering around have one. Why? I don't know, I guess they wanted to limit the player/companion tanking for each other with blocking, or that it's related to Gifts being usable at almost any time. There are a couple weapons good for blocking and gifts for temporarily buffing blocking as well, so this is just a very minor complaint.Ultimately, it was worth the playthrough, and 100% steam achievements isn't bad since you can do it all with one character and NG+ cycles. However, it leaves much to be desired, and if it gets a sequel, I will at least wait for the reviews and gameplay footage before buying. Unless one of my friends gifts it to me like this game.			"
Recommended,10.9,"																I don't watch (or particularly like) anime, so when I first heard of this game, I thought I won't touch it with a ten foot pole. But later I watched streams, and tried the demo, and it convinced me to give it a try. This turned out to be a good idea.The gameplay is pretty much standard souls-like, but the rpg system is slightly different. Your stats are leveled equally and you alter them and customize your build entirely with various items. So you can change builds on the fly. Important part of the combat are 'gifts', which are basically spells, buffs, and special moves for weapons. There are a lot, and there’s something for all playstyles. These cost ichor, which is the third character resource after hp and stamina. You can restore ichor by hitting enemies, as opposed to healing, which you can only get at mistles (basically bonfires), as per classic Dark Souls tradition. I personally prefer soulslike games where we are somewhat independent of bonfires (like Dark Souls 2 with lifegems, or the Surge 2's energy system), although this game does seem balanced for limited healing.The difficulty is friendlier than in DS, since you get an AI teammate who can distract enemies and even revive you. This doesn't make it too easy, in fact, the game seems to be balanced around this, but it's nice to able to start at a lower difficulty, as opposed to having no options. You can of course leave the AI partner, if you desire more challenge.The visuals of the game are a mixed bag. The weapons, enemies and characters can only be described as ""over the top"". This took me some time to get used to, but at some point I just accepted that things here can be just silly. There are some really cool designs among the enemies though. Some environments are kinda bland but there are spectacular looking areas too. The level design is great, it’s based around shortcuts, and having decent exploration. Some maps are quite labyrinthine, which I really liked. I also have to mention the character creator, which is just amazing. So many options. I can safely say that it was one of the main reasons I started playing this game.As far as the story goes, I didn't know what to expect, but I liked it. Based on the silly aspects of the presentation I though it's going to be like that, but then it threw character drama, tragedy and hard hitting moments at me. I wasn't ready for that! But it was a pleasant surprise. The story is quite complicated, but in a good way. It was fun to discover and kept me interested till the end. Also shout out to the absolute banger soundtrack.I was afraid to dive into this, but ended up loving it. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the Souls gameplay loop.			"

Recommended,125.2,"																Added 26 hour update at the bottom==========================I'm only 5 hours in and I'm already hooked. I come from the Dark Souls trilogy being my top 3 most played games here on Steam, just so you know what kind of gaming I do.I was hooked at the fashion souls and the game so far is really nice. Graphics are great, movement and combat is fast and fun. There seems to be quite a bit in the way of customizing weapons and whatnot as well.I don't mean to keep comparing to the DS series but if you're like me, that might be why you wanted to check this title out in the first place so I will say this is so far easier. Now I know difficulty is subjective for everybody so let me explain a bit.As far as difficulty of ""not dying"", I was able to got a full 4 hours or so before getting killed. Anyone that has played any DS knows, pro or not that you WILL die long before you get to the 4 hour mark. That doesn't mean this isn't challenging or fun, it's just different. Now speaking of different...There seems to be more in the way of weapons systems and how you can change them on the fly, in the DS series you basically made a build and spec'd accordingly. In this game, you can change playstyle on the fly depending on your situation and that means not only changing the weapons but the effects and buffs the weapons have as well. You also pair with an assortment of NPC helpers and THEY have abilities themselves that can work with what you have going on as well. The depth is amazing here.The combat feels more in line with the games like Sekiro and Bloodborne, not necessarily the same speed but it seems to reward you for being a little on the aggressive side. I might have used block maybe three times so far and I LOVE parrying in this game. Backstabs are badass too, different effects depending on which weapon your using as well. I came for the ""anime dark souls with titties"" and stayed for the ""anime dark souls with titties and awesome combat, weapons, enemies, areas and amazing fights.""If you're on the fence, I say go for it. I'm having a blast.=============================Update 12-14-20Couple of extra notes to add now that I'm around 26 hours in. The story is nowhere near as convoluted as the lore in DS, and it's also spoon fed to you by way of cutscenes and dialogue rather than having to read every item description and then consult with forums and Vaati on YT to understand it better. It took quite a while but I have finally been in a boss encounter than was a bit punishing. Another nuance on the combat, thus far the way I'm powering thru a majority of the levels and enemies is with a strength type build with big heavy weapons. I DO venture off in some areas with a completely new loadout and play as a caster but the same rules apply for what I'm about to say. So speaking just from MY individual experience, as I stated before the combat doesn't seem like you have to be quite as deliberate as you did in DS 1or 2 BUT, when you get to the bosses you can't just run around hack n slashing.You still have to worry about stamina management, how and which consumables you use, figuring out their weaknesses etc. So again, lets say you get to the DLC in DS2, you KNOW you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you are a pure mage, caster, hexer, etc. So you either have to re spec just to do the DLC or just learn to live the absolute hell you're going to endure. In this game, you simply change your blood code, select the gifts you want, change your weapons to match the style you need and get after it. One area may be easier with power, the next with finesse. The ability to change them on the fly is something I greatly appreciate, and again the ability to have an NPC tag along with you (with their own set of skills and abilities) is really cool. If you want the game to be harder, go it alone. It's almost like a build in difficulty slider that so many people want in these types of games. ​(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง			"

Not Recommended,79.3,"																Story of weebs and souls or vamps and ash. Souls being one of the favorite genres with basically all games hitting well enough along with your weeaboo stuff which really doesn't hit often in games, but in ye olde boob souls it's pretty good experience.It's certainly a souls game, but how CODE VEIN differs from other souls games for sure much more heavier story and cutscenes in it along with it doesn't have exactly stat building, but instead it's more of class swapping. Main Character has special ability to control anyone elses blood code and use their skills either active or passive ones and make deeper learning of them to mix them with any other one. Blood code can be swapped at any point from open ones so you can basically go from melee to caster to ranged at any given point, but as usual in souls not while in combat, action keeps going on except in photo mode.To a true souls style basically every damned door is blocked and opens from the other side, ladders are up, miasmas (bonfires) are here and there, but levels are not so surprisingly interconnected between each other. Mainly they tend to go one to second and from second to third with few exception. There are swampy place, city ruins, sandy ruins, snowy ruins, bloody ruins etc going on and between areas enemies called Lost tend to change depending on area. Lost are basically Vamps, but lost in blood frenzy and have become bone cracked monstrosities for main character and pals to slap around. Then there is ash which is basically vamp (revenant) who got struck into the heart and went to a puff.CODE VEIN has boss fight for each of the areas so, some even have pair of them and map sizes vary also. Caverns were quite fast to go through, but then the mess of Cathedral felt like there was four maps in one, got lost even at one point. Mapping still does exist when finding miasma or little flower or beating enemy with said flower in their head. There's plenty of loot and chests thrown out to the maps, so totally ransacking every place along with enemy fetch/whack em quests it took about 40 hours minus some AFK time to do all maps + depths which are basically extra content.Guess one question would be how hard is it, well it can be at points quite challenging, but you have companion with you to give relief in those situations. The Boreal Brutes were OP and blue fire thingies in flame city, first boss did hit quite hard as well along with few others. Think this souls game is the only one where used companion all the time and not just situationally, they tend to make remarks of things (can be put off in settings) and honestly didn't find anyone else annoying besides Io which is the original sidekick for MC though not first one you have beside you fighting. For all of these people there are memories to find more about the story and what they have experienced, quite much of it builds around companions and their past is quite intwined to main story events of CODE VEIN.Not exceptional, but very solid and good souls type of a game with it's own style.

Recommended,74.5,"																CODE VEINPublisher : Bandai Namco EntertaimentDeveloper : Bandai Namco Studio and ShiftRelease year : 2019Reviewed by : Someone who have never finished any Souls games,Nioh,and Sekiro but managed to finished this one.IntroductionCode Vein is an ambitious and excellent action Japanese games with anime style inspired by the Souls genre and developed by the studio behind God Eater that was inspired by Monster Hunter series. Bandai Namco have once more prove themselves to be one of the best Japan games developer as this company managed to produced Tales of series,DBZ series,Tekken series,God Eater and ETC. I was a fans of the original God Eater back in my PSP i put 1000+ hours on both GE and GE 2 as the original concept and ideas is from Monster Hunter and i prefer to choose GE series because of its difficulty,story,and a more stylish casual upbringing gameplay of it.Everything about Code Vein is absolutely amazing. I decided that i want to do this review so that more peoples will listen and hopefully to be interested for getting this beautifully well crafted games made with passion,so lets get into it!...StoryThe world of Code Vein is filled with interesting background story and interesting plot development,the entire story takes place in a fictional version of our planet having our Humanity falls into destruction and extinction as the vampires rules the world because of the disaster that everyone remember as The Great Collapse which Humans got turned into Vampires and called as The Revenantsin the world of Vampires of course they must need bloods right...!? so does these Revenants.the world laws have changed as the Revenants begin to suffer from their thirst for blood,caused by the unknown red mists that happens around the place,because of this crueltyRevenants started to hunts Human for their bloods(Inspired by Owari no Seraph ?),but thankfully Human was never the first resource they need to satisfy their thirst thus Blood beads or the fruit made by Blood trees exist in the world of Code Vein.The Main Character or you,is a Revenant that have losing your memories and its your task now to uncover who you are and what are you in the middle of this painful cruel world.CharactersCode Vein have a great range of interesting characters that serve a great story with each of them,it is also the reason why i fall in love with this games.Characters like Louis for female fans favorite and Mia for male fans favorite which she actually voiced by Ai Kayano!...(WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!...)Lots more characters that join your adventure as you progress the story and you will learn their lost memories.These memories cutscene is something new that haven't much exist in other games,where you explored those memories by walking through the diorama and it was accompanied by a beautiful piano as you walk through it.Beside all of those memories,there is still so many cutscenes in the games that will makes you feels emotionally and sometimes crying because as i do too...(Mia Nicola cutscene have breaking me apart...)as for Gameplay section there is a lots for me to cover so i will try to mention it as much as i can.Combat (Gameplay)Gameplay in Code vein is very similiar to Souls genre,as you can Run,Dodge and Block but not Jump.I found the missing feature of jumping which is very acceptable,as the games have a lots of animation already even though some is taken from God Eater series and the fact we don't need mobility the way Sekiro punishing players much and have to makes everyone keeps moving 90% of the time,although the games seems to being incosistent in how they wants player to approach the stage as they walk in because there is a lots of area that by logic everyone could have makes a small leap and they can cross the other path.Obstacles like these is actually not very uncommon in Code Vein maps because somehow the developer try to makes funny of the players sufferings with movement and i will get into the maps section later.in Code Vein is more looks like GE instead of Souls games.There is Light attack and Heavy attack,you can end a combo with a powerful end animation like these combination as example :simple one such as X + X + Y or X + Y and the advance one such as RB + X or RB + Y(these require extra stamina but do more damage.) it somehow similiar to Musou games made by KT and if you have play God Eater series before,you will get familiar with this games faster as it resembled a huge amounts of GE in terms of combat and movement with the addition of Parry and Drain.Parry in Code Vein using LT as default is rewarding because not only it deal a HUGE damage!... but also it generates Inchor(Blood Drain) which i get into it later,the parry time in this games is very forgiving so please do parry much because not only its crucial but also it let you to see some kewl animation~Drain in Code Vein using B as default is a moveset to deal damage but also generates Inchor,it can be combine mid-combo like X + X + (RB + B) but do noted that this isn't as effective as Parry overall.about Stamina you need this Stamina to Dodge too...By that i meant... DO A BARREL ROLL!...Rolling around in this games requires a HUGE TONS of stamina.Dodging is essential in this games and while you are invincible during your rolling animation,beware that rolling time in Code Vein is very short.When an enemy swinging or bash their weapon at you and your have stopped rolling,it gives you a bigger damage twice the damage you take when you just standing still it makes you have to be wise in dodging anything...(LIKE ANYTHING!... including traps...)so it would be wise to Guard when you can Dodge because when your Stamina is out during Guard your guard will break but the damage you take isn't twice like when your Dodge fails to be perfomed.Blood Code(Gameplay) Code Vein have some JRPG elements in it but the level up system is auto-raise so you don't have to manually configure the stat in your character and these parameter can be raised via Classes or Blood Code.Blood Code is an innovative ideas for Code Vein,these Blood Code will raise your stat and auto-scaling it.these Blood Code can be gained as you search around the map or when you defeated a Successor(The Bosses in Code Vein)Existence of Blood code will change your playstyle with it stats,whether you want to be a DPS,Supports,or Tank.Blood Code can be combined with any gears you have and any weapons you have as long as your character build met the requirement stat and weapon appliable,these Blood Code comes with Gifts(Skills) that lets you to use it power when you equipped the Blood Code but its not exclusive as you can just master the Gifts profiency or use gatherable item called Awaken.When your Blood Code Gifts profiency being fufilled you can use the Gifts on any Blood Code you have,but beware that to perfom any Gifts it requires you to use Inchor or Blood Drain in Code Vein.DifficultyDifficulty in Code Vein is as you can expect in Souls genre,sometimes it feels you are Jon Snow but sometimes it feels like ""I just wants... to... break... my... *insert anything of your choice*""But before that!... don't give in to your temper first!~ because Code Vein is CO-OP able games.You can send a Batman signal anytime you needs help fighting those enemy and both host and guest is being rewarded for playing together!~ConclusionDo you like Owari no Seraph ?Do you have PTSD from Sekiro ?Do you like to praise the sun with your 2D anime *tiddies ?**Cough* Breast slider exist SORRY SONY...if YES then this is the games for you!~ Thank you for reading :)Review note : due to limit of review typing characters in the review i haven't describe everything about the games but please by all means... GET THIS GAMES and SUPPORTS IT!~			"

Recommended,68.1,"																I wish Steam had something between ""Recommended"" and “Not Recommended.” Code Vein does a lot of things really well, but it also does some critical things quite poorly, and some people will be more bothered by that than others. Ultimately I can't recommend this game because I don't think it's worth finishing, but there’s enough to like here that you may want to play the game anyway.The GoodI’ll start with the things Code Vein does well. Code Vein has fantastic core systems. Instead of allocating your stats directly, you pick a “Code” (kind of like a class) which allocates your stats for you. For example, the Berserker Code has high Strength and Vitality, whereas the Caster Code has high Mind and Willpower. Associated with each Code are “Gifts,” active or passive abilities of which you can equip a limited number. Gifts are initially restricted to the Code they’re associated with, but you can “master” them over time by using them, and once a Gift is mastered it can be equipped on any Code. These systems offer a ton of variety and customizability, far more than any other Souls-like I’ve played. You can also change your equipped Code and Gifts at any time, making it easy to tweak your build to suit the challenge at hand.Code Vein also includes a “transformation” system for gear akin to the infusion system in Dark Souls 3. By using special materials, you can add elemental or status damage to your weapons in exchange for reduced stat scaling. You can similarly transform your armor to change its resistances. Code Vein makes it easy to swap transformations, meaning you can tweak your weapon’s damage type and your armor’s resistances to suit the challenge at hand. Code Vein also makes all transformations available from the start, provided you have the materials to perform the infusion. This is in stark contrast to Dark Souls, where certain infusions aren’t available until close to the end of the game no matter what materials you have on hand.Finally, Code Vein’s gifts are fueled by the “Ichor” system. Ichor functions like mana - you spend it to use your active gifts. Ichor is regained by dealing damage to enemies, which encourages you to play aggressively rather than defensively when running low on Ichor. If you’re in the middle of a boss fight and a key buff runs out, you don’t retreat and chug from a flask like you would in Dark Souls 3. Instead, you go on the offensive and take the Ichor you need.The BadUnfortunately, that’s where the good ends in Code Vein. The core systems are fantastic, but the actual content of the game is lacklustre. This means that Code Vein is fun initially as you experiment with its core systems, but starts to drag as you settle into a build and get further into the game.The first issue is the lack of variety, both in areas and in enemies. Most of the game’s areas are variations on the same “ruined city” theme. The fire area is just a ruined city that’s on fire. The desert area is just a ruined city that’s been partially filled in with sand. And etc. There are a few areas that deviate from this theme, but they’re few and far between. The same is true of the enemies. You’re going to spend a lot of time fighting the same basic grunts. Almost every area uses these grunts, just with varying health and damage numbers. Each area also has a few “unique” enemy types to spice things up, but even these enemy types are reskinned and reused multiple times. The number of unique enemy types in the game is quite small.The second issue is the boss roster. By and large, it’s lacklustre. There are a few standouts that really require you to buckle down and “git gud,” but they’re few and far between. Most of the bosses are quite easy and can be beaten in only a few attempts. There are also a handful of stinkers in the boss roster, with insufficient telegraphs and unfair mechanics. All in all, it’s a pretty disappointing collection of bosses.The third issue is the story. Code Vein does away with the atmosphere and mystery typical to the genre and instead opts to tell a more straightforward story with straightforward characters. Code Vein also puts a much larger focus on its narrative than most Souls-likes. The problem is that the story and the characters aren’t compelling enough to carry the larger narrative focus. The characters are mostly stock anime tropes, as are most of the major plot beats. Over time the story and characters become predictable, and consequently become boring.When you add all three issues together, you get a game that grows increasingly dull the further into it you get. The enemies are initially dangerous and exciting, but you eventually master them and start hungering for more. It’s fine that the early bosses are pushovers, but the difficulty curve doesn’t rise with your skill level. While it’s fun to indulge the cheesiness of the story early on, it eventually grows dull and your motivation to see it to the end fades. By the end of the game, there’s not a whole lot left to compel you to keep playing.ConclusionUltimately, I can’t recommend Code Vein because I don’t think it’s a game worth finishing. That being said, I did actually quite enjoy my time with Code Vein. I really enjoyed experimenting with its core systems in the first half of my playthrough, and I don’t regret playing the game. If you don’t mind not finishing the game, it may be worth picking up Code Vein despite its problems.I really hope the team behind this game gets a chance to make a sequel, because I think the game’s core systems attached to a world and enemy roster with more variety could make for a really excellent game.

Recommended,60.6,"																 ANIME SOULS A nice souslike where 90% of budget got into physics for titty, jokes aside, ost in this game its good, and you can make use of different sets of abilities to have a variety of ways to play, BUT, i didnt feel joy trying to play it a second time, so i think its a really good only run experience and isnt worth doin' 100%.  PROS - Good char creator, a lot of features to create a really unique char- Story- I think its cool how you have a cutscene for every parry and backstab you do- OST- building and learning the story of the NPCS- Have some nice boss designs - You have the option to refight some boss fights if you want(with other builds i think you get the most profit of this feature) CONS - You fight basically the same mobs the whole game, a really bad design for normal enemies- The dlc are kinda reskins with good weapons....sadly Note : 7/10 			"
Recommended,17.6,"																Anime-Souls at it's finest! Great game!Played it co-op from start to finish and enjoyed the hell out of it. + Character Creation!+ Story.+ Lots of good and fun combat. + Plenty of blood codes (classes), weapons and skills to play around with. + Good amount of bosses.+ Fun Co-op.+ Level design was pretty good.+ Characters.+ Io <3- Some laggy co-op, but nothing game breaking.- There is a variety of armour, but not enough that is strength based. I got bored of mine after using it for the whole game.- One particular level that is just really boring.- Not a big variety of enemies.Lots of goodness in this game. Loved it. I would say wait for at least a 20% off sale if you're a bit unsure about it. But I think it was worth it at it's full price!My rating:7.5/10 Revenants.			"
Recommended,12.9,"																Great game and Highly recommend it if you like god eater and dark souls elements in games (bonfire-like checkpoints, dodging etc).There is only a few things about it that I hate and wish they will improve.    1. Cathedral of the sacred blood probably the WORST area in the game, its way to long and makes you navigate what feels like an impossible maze. which in turn, makes the level start to feel like a chore to get through. I wasted like 8+ hrs trying to find the right paths to make any progress whatsoever. Not looking forward to coming here again in NG+ honestly.    2. No Height or breast Slider in character creation. almost every game with character creation has this.. Female player characters with the height of a male protagonist looks just stupid to look at when other characters are much shorter. Like Io and Eva. I hope they add these sliders in a patch or at least shorten the female player character a bit. With an amazing character creation like CODE VEIN has it was to be expected but sadly nope.     3. I hope they add a little weight to the 1 handed weapons cause the character swings them around like there cardboard cutouts. and as a dark souls player it bugs me a bit. (kinda one of the things I hated about god eater too)4. Music is great but starts to get boring and repetitive  after awhile, which is very disappointing seeing that Go Shiina composed it and he made an amazing soundtrack for God Eater series.5. Vestige memories aka forced walking lore simulator, they were better off making short cinematic cutscenes for these honestly but at least your can skip them. More of a review part now:	The game runs great even on maxed out settings. you can basicly unlock the framerate by putting it to 200+ fps cap. only had one crash so far, other people had issues trying to launch it or just random crashes, but it works fine for me.Default Keyboard controls are weird but 99% of the controls are remapable, mouse support is awesome and is super responsive.The native controller support is great too, the on-screen buttons even change if your using eiher a xbox or ps4 controller. (I used controller for my current playthrough)Story is really good so far (currently 15-something hrs in the story, rest of my playtime on my first character was me going afk, which is why it says 20+ hrs) This game is very cutscene heavy since its more story driven, so if your someone who hates watching cutscenes no matter how short or long they are, this may annoy you a bit. (personally I enjoy watching them as they are animated really well)Combat feels more hack and slash then a souls-like, which doesnt matter much to me honestly. but a lot of others hate it. All in all the game is really amazing. it has some flaws but no game is perfect. If you are coming into this game expecting it to be ""Anime Dark-Souls""  you're gonna be really disapointed, Its not a dark souls clone it never will be, It only takes elements from the franchise like bonfires, stamina bar management, Rolling etc. Come into this game treating it as its own thing and not a souls-like is the best way to enjoy this game. 			"
Recommended,48.2,"																This is more than just an anime clone of Dark Souls.It takes a lot from the Souls series, but does a lot on its own, and it works very well. It is not a flawless game by any means, but it still delivers a very solid experience overall.So, let's start with the presentation.Graphics are pretty good and general art direction is very solid, as long as you like anime style. It gets pretty over the top at times, but it never really felt too out of place to me. Everything is generally of good quality and holds up pretty well. Character designs, bosses and most of the regular enemies are pretty nice looking. Locations are a bit of a let-down, however. They are serviceable, but they often feel... dry. When you compare them to stuff you see in Dark Souls, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. In those games, almost every location felt meticulously hand crafted and unique. Code Vein suffers from corridors and arenas that look like a set of copied and pasted elements sharing a theme. Ironically, one of the most unique locations made this kind of a theme, completely on purpose.The design isn't bad here, really, but it could use more distinct touch, so to speak. More unique looking setpieces would serve this game really well. There are some very unique and great looking places in this game, and it shows that creators are capable of creating some amazing stuff when given a chance.Another thing that is a slight disappointment is enemy variety. It is not bad per se, again, but you will start seeing recollors after a while. Many have ares-specific variations you will see almost everywhere. That being said, what is there, is of good quality.Music is very solid, but the rest of the sound design is just good. There is nothing terrible in sound design, but nothing really stands out either. The character editor is among the best I've seen yet, in terms of amount of features available and intuitive use. I only wish there was more ability to edit faces. Still, what is already available is pretty amazing in its own right. Gameplay is more or less standard issue for Souls-like games. You have your strong attacks, weak attacks, blocks, dodges, parries, your Estus and Bonfire equivalents. But the game has some unique twists to it.Your stats are governed by your chosen blood code, which is basically equivalent to class - it gives you abilities, and provides a stat spread you can change only in limited manner by adjusting passive ablities. You can unlock most abilities from each blood codes to use them freely among the others, eventually allowing you to basically pick and choose exactly what you want. The game encourages this strongly from the start - trying to stick to single class is basically a suicide. You can change classes basically on the fly.This allows you to craft build for specific situations. You may have separate build for exploration and boss fights. This game invites experimentation and cheesing.The parry system is also slightly modified in comparison to Dark Souls. The type of parry you perform is determined by your armor - it makes sense in context of the game, trust me on this one. You use it basically like in Dark Souls, but your character flashes when parry is effective - it shows you your parry window - a nice quality of life improvement.Parrying is tied to ichor mechanics - this is basically your mana that you use for your abilities and spells. Successful parry, backstab or special drain attack replenishes your ichor and increases its max capacity. Ichor is also replenished slowly while performing regular melee attacks. The whole game is designed around playing with AI partner. It makes the game noticeably easier than one would expect from the genre, which is not essentially a bad thing. You can speak with your partners and go without them if you so desire. AI companions are competent for the most part and can hold their own in combat and even revive your at cost of their own health. They also provide unique buffs, and they are pretty good. The challenge feels good, though certain enemies have some massively wide attack patterns and insanely good tracking that borders on feeling cheap at times. Story itself is solid. I won't delve into the details here. It holds pretty well. It is quite dark and heavy, but not quite as depressing as Dark Souls, for that matter. It is not insanely over the top either, as far, as the style would imply. I wouldn't call it grounded by any means, but it fits what it tries to do. I must say. It is a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect much more than a stylized Dark Souls clone but I've got much, much more. A word on DLCs - get them on the sale. They are pretty short, and revolve mostly around insanely mighty bosses and challenge runs around them. The items you get from this are nice, if you are planning multiple runs, but are by no means essential for the main game (all of them are VERY late game content, as in something you'd be able to BARELY tackle right before the final boss battle anyway).

Recommended,18.2,"																Hello friends,Today i will write a review about the game CODE VEIN. This is a game that involves revenants that are similiar to vampires. Many people compare this game to dark souls, as many aspects of the game has same mechanics as the dark souls games. The character you create has a great selection of customization options, even better when you buy the dlc stuff. They also added new customization options since the game came out, such as holiday items and new emotes to use in the game. Many of the graphic style is similiar to anime looking characters. If you do not like anime looking characters, you may wish to avoid this game. Also, if you want a easier game than dark souls, that is similiar in style to the dark souls games with anime, then this game is your choice to try. Anyways, here are my pro and con points:PROS:- A JRPG with similiar mechanics to the dark souls games.- The difficulty level gets pretty hard very fast, but can be done if careful.- Great music and nice graphics.- Very good customization system for making your own character how you want it.- The ability to mix skills in blood codes to make a build how you want, with many different skills, it is almost infinite how many build you can make depending on the skills you fully learn.- Variety of different weapons and ability to upgrade them and even add different status effects to them so enemy can be effected by them.- New game plus modes add more difficult enemies which is similiar when you beat the dark souls story. Each consecutive beaten game increases the difficulty of the game enemies and bosses.- Works on windows 11 OS.- Works with controllers. I am using a NEO switch controller.CONS:- Sometimes finding a co-op partner to play certain boss areas is very hard. It is recommended to ask on the steam forums to see if anyone can help you, or ask a friend to help you in the game if you can.- The game sometimes crashes and the internet and servers sometimes crash causing you to lose online play with other people.- Online play allows you to not fully co-op the game, but only certain parts with a co-op partner. This means you need to reinvite them back everytime you go to new area or want to fight a different boss together.- Some armor can clip for certain styles of mixing  armors. This means sometimes the armor will clip thru and even go thru the blood mask (veil) and look sloppy. There are settings you can change to prevent this by turning off certain armor pieces in game in settings.Recommended for a game that is likened to the dark souls game forumula with very good character creator selection and ability to make many different builds using many of the skills you can learn throught the game. Avoid if you do not like anime style jrpg graphics.			"

It's a pretty good game. The characters feel pretty good and the customisation of your character is just great. The game's a bit short but it's fine. There are 4 endings in total, which two of them are almost identical. The only thing that is bad on this game are the DLC's, whatever happens, DO NOT pay the full price for them, it's not worth it. It's just a dungeon map where you have to kill ""bosses"" that are just reskins of the enemies you've already encountered and are more spammy and have more health. Then they throw a new boss which has a ton of hp (but you can make a build that almost 1 shots him lol). To proceed to the boss you have to get items which drop from the ""bosses"" around the map, in one of those DLC's the ""boss"" didn't drop it and thus making it impossible to proceed trough the DLC. For the price, you should wait for a sale. I give this game a 8/10.			"

Recommended,54.4,"																Code Vein is commonly described as Souls-like game, but at its core it's a 50% Souls-like and 50% an ""anime game"". If you don't like one of the two then it might be difficult to get into. Just to skip to inevitable comparisons here's a list of mechanics and elements any Souls player is likely to be already familiar with: Rolling/dodging to avoid attacks. Backstabbing. Parrying. Poise (unless you only played DkS3). Stamina management. Checkpoints for refilling a healing item. Ability to teleport between previously discovered checkpoints. Healing item can be enhanced to have more uses and healing power. Leaving currency behind upon defeat. Using currency to level up. Gear enhancement and modification materials. 2 player online cooperation and a password system. Fog walls. New Game+ cycles. Milan Cathedral. Ornstein and Smough. Point down gesture.These are the few notable ones.The GoodCombat is one of the most important aspects of the game and it's absolutely solid. Controls are responsive, animations are smooth, audiovisual feedback is adequate and it's generally satisfying to play. Different gear (blood veils), weapons, classes (blood codes) and skills (gifts) provide flexibility and can be switched on the go. Blood codes come with a set of gifts that can be learned, inherited and used across other blood codes. Currently equipped blood code affects all your base stats which, in return, affect what weapons and active gifts you can equip. There are 4 passive, 8 active gift slots and over 200 gifts to choose from, allowing a good variety of potential builds.All active gifts consume MP (ichor) and the game encourages constant ichor usage. The amount of ichor you have is determined mostly by your blood code. Ichor can be recovered during a battle by attacking, blocking, parrying, backstabbing, charged draining, focus launch attacks and the latter four approaches also temporarily increase the amount of ichor you can hold. Combat experience is severely affected by the usage of active gifts and, aside from saving some for the boss, there's no reason why a player shouldn't actively use ichor.Dodging has 3 distinct speeds that are affected by your total weight. Weight limits are dictated by the blood code, your current dodge mobility is determined by the combined weight of the equipped blood veil and held weapon. These 3 speeds can be described as: fat roll, quick roll (50%), dodge (20%). The lighter you are, the longer your evasion distance and the more invincibility frames you have. Succesful dodging fills up focus bar, which, when full, decreases the chance of the character being staggered and enables a special move.Cooperation is available throughout the whole game, as long as the area's boss is still around. Optional areas (depths) have respawning bosses, offering infinite co-op grind for resources and medals. A password system is present, so finding friends is easy and instant. If the joining character's level doesn't match, then they get downscaled to the host's level, therefore you don't have to worry about being out of cooperation range. The downside is that it's only 2 player co-op, there's no PvP or PvP invasions. The host can still have an active NPC partner, so the total amount of party members is up to 3.Character creator gets a mention for being powerful, while staying user-friendly. It's easy to create a distinct looking character, there are tons of haircuts, presets, accessories, colors, patterns, fine detail tuning and sliders to tinker with. There aren't that many available outfits, but at least existing ones are modular.The NeutralStarting difficulty is relatively low, especially if you prefer greatswords. With high damage weapons pretty much all bosses can be staggered, steamrolled and bruteforced without much effort. New Game+ offers a difficulty increase and this is where the actual challenge appears: bosses one-two shot the player, it's a good opportunity to learn attack patterns for effective dodges and punishing, there's motivation to make more efficient builds. People that enjoy challenge should either stay at very low levels or get to NG+ as soon as possible.About that 50% anime part. The game isn't afraid to show you its plot right in your face. There's an overwhelming amount of tropetastic story in a form of cutscenes and walking simulator segments. It doesn't tell a particularly breathtaking or plot twisty story, handful of outcomes are predictable, but the walking sim part stands out a little with its approach. 95% of scenes can be skipped, which is a good thing.The NitpicksThe soundtrack is lacking, repetitive, occasionally unfitting. This isn't about those select awesome tracks like the main theme, but about what the player hears during 90% of the game play. When you're actively exploring an area you often hear a suspense theme and when you're engaged in combat you get one of the two generic-sounding battle themes. Right after every single battle there's a bell ""ding"" just to point out that the threat is gone. Boss themes are decent, but are often reused, especially in the depths. Depths are notorious to have mini boss fights where the ""fight"" duration on average is 20 seconds. You never get a chance for a good listen, hence I do remember those memorable 10 seconds of repeat boss themes. Throughout the journey the player visits through variety of different people's memories, such visits are really frequent and every single time you're greeted with a sad violin or a sad piano, likely one of those two themes. It might seem charming and enchanting the first time, but not after hearing the same theme for 30 times. The player experience would've been better if the game had a bigger theme variety and amount, especially since a lot of Go Shiina's previous works are really enjoyable. As a purely subjective thing: orchestral soundtracks aren't as memorable because most triple A games go this route.World's visual and level designs lack variety. It's a post-apocalyptic modern world, where everything looks brown and dirty... and it stays that way for the most part of the game. Destroyed urban environments, rocky locations, caves, all of those areas look very generic, brown and unappealing. There are two areas that are basically FROM SOFTWARE tax and even those underdeliver. One of those two areas is a Milan Cathedral inspired maze that is supposed to look stunning, except it doesn't. The reason behind this (aside from the seeming budget limitations) is the chosen cheaper approach to level design: some sections of the level are fully modular and on top of that there are a lot of reused assets. Same dirty white-brown-gray tiled textures everywhere, same-looking corridors, same-looking arenas really hammer it home. This is especially noticeable in depths, which are made out from mostly recycled assets and modules.There seems to be a recurring theme throughout most of the locations of the game: enemies placed behind corners. An artificial difficulty increase for sure, but it happens often enough that you start checking all corners first.Brief Technical Stuff:Adequate stability, no crashes, a bit disappointing frame rate (drops below 60 at 1080p). Netcode on the joining person's side can be a bit laggy with boss battles going out of sync for a couple of seconds.Current notable bugs: having too many blood code loadouts breaks co-op connectivity. If you're failing to connect to a friend, be sure to select the same Steam download region.Conclusion:Code Vein handles combat really well and a solid co-op implementation makes the whole package an entertaining experience.Review copy provided by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment.

Recommended,3.9,"																This is actually my first venture into a Souls-like game, a genre I have refused to touch as I am more of an open-world adventure type of player. Due to a partial lockdown, I finally decided to give it a shot. Ok yeah I could've downloaded the Souls series instead, but I am a big fan of Japanese anime so yeah. Suffice to say, I have never been challenged this much by a game ever since Batman: Arkham City, and I absolutely enjoyed every bit of it, even the times when my character would die multiple times from boss fights.Your first obstacle (and perhaps THE ultimate boss) in the game is the character creator itself. It is nowhere near as robust as the one found in Black Desert Remastered, but it's at the same level. You will be spoiled for choice as to how you would want your character to appear, so much so you can attempt re-creating actual anime characters itself. Even if you do finally get an avatar ready, do not be surprised to find yourself back at the character editor once you've unlocked your safe house. Yep, you can re-edit your avatar's looks from your safe house, so go wild.Combat is very well thought out and you need to keep your wits about you as every action you take may result in life or death for your character as EVERY action (even to simple dodging or guarding) consumes stamina, a resource once depleted may render you unable to take action (fellow newcomers like myself take note). Having the companionship of an AI partner in exploration helps but optional. I have to say though, the AI of every companion is SUPERB. it was as if you do have a running dog who will have your back. The character classes of the game i.e. Blood Codes are so in-depth that it is easy to understand what should their primary role be, but it is hard to master building one due to the over-abundance of codes (and bestowed abilities within code) that are available.Story-wise, I wouldn't grade it as a masterpiece like Yakuza 0/Kiwami 2 or the Ezio trilogy of games from Assassin's Creed, but it's good enough to tug at the feels. Furthermore, all characters in-game (down to even the most mundane NPCs who give sidequests) have their own personality, and especially for those whose memories you can restore, it fleshes out their character even further which makes you feel for them. I won't go into details but certain memories made me spill a tear or two just from further reveals of their past.Overall, it has been an exhilarating experience of a game which had pleasantly surprised me in every way. Code Vein has successfully brought out rushes of adrenaline which I haven't felt for a long time after spending a whole year playing FFXV and AC Odyssey. To anyone who wishes to play any Souls-like games but dare not touch the Souls series itself, give this a shot.Now, time to go download God Eater 3......P.S. It is sufficient to get the base game itself. The DLCs have no story content.			"
Recommended,29.8,"																- My reviews are always honest and open for further updates if necessary. They contain minor spoilers, only basic ones and stuff you wont miss anyways as its not related to story but to gameplay.Code Vein, popular in 2019-Early 2020, still popular but not as it used to be.If you ever wondered if its possible to create an anime dark souls, the guys on Bandai Namco made it possible!As long as you dont overlevel, you will have to learn from mistakes, trial and error.The good:- Anime style graphics, i love anime art, put it on a dark atmosphere and you have something amazing.All the cutscenes, levels, enemies, characters, details, etc, look very good.Its not as perfect as RDR2 graphics, but for a game with anime art-style they made it look amazing, not as bright as Genshin impact color palette but much more mature. This game was made for both normies and weebs per equal, unlike Genshin that is kinda a weeb paradise xD.- The animations are pretty solid too, both on gameplay during attacks and cutscenes.- My god, the story/lore of the game is full of emotions, there is some drama behind some of the characters, you will get lots of tears during some sad cutscenes, but you will love every part of them, most of games that allows you to create your own character by the cost of muting it, feel like your character is there as decoration and the protagonist is someone else (Looking at you Fallout 3 Dad), not on this game tho, your character is a very important key to the destiny of the world.- Mia is absolutely adorable, both the caring personality of the character, and aspect, if you disagree you will have to fight me directly :3- Man the goddang Io's anime tiddies....- The more you know about the main characters pasts by watching their memories, the more you like them and the more you feel attached to them, you will feel like to save all of them, even the hunter. You develop good feelings to them and they are there as your main friends group, if you get the best ending, you will see that your adventures are not over yet, and that the same group will be there to carry you on a possible Code Vein 2...- You have to get used to the gameplay mechanic, but when you do, which takes a few hours, you will realize how GOOD they are, i can be smashed for this but somehow in my opinion, the blood codes and blood veils mechanics are even better than the classic dark souls level up system, blood veils are not to be used for fashion-souls, but are there to be used wisely depending on your build/weapons.- The weapons are made there not for their stats, but for your own playstyle, most of them have different attack patterns (Not all of them tho), range, speed and weight. Spears for example have different types of charged attack, while some charges to far away enemies, others have circular attacks that hits all enemies that surround you, 1H swords are an exception, most of which i used have the same type of attacks. Then you have magic/ichor attacks for mage type users that prefer to cast spells, and finally heavy weapons for tanks.The Bad:- Grinding is sometimes necesary in games if you want a good outcome and advantage in battles or want to search for collectibles/find something important as requirement to get a good ending on the story, or the perfect true ending. While this game requires you to find Vastages to get the true ending, if you playing it blind without guides, like me, you will soon be overleveled if you dont die/loose the haze (IG level up currency), and use it to level up. After some time you will feel overpowered to the point some enemies die in 1/2 hits, if you do it right and use blood codes and veils wisely and upgrade weapons, it gets into one shot fest with some enemies that used to be hard dying in one hit. So the game requires you to search extra areas for vastages to get the perfect ending, while they are infested with enemies you must fight and grind to safely obtain the collectibles. In other games it is indeed satisfying to come back to stronger enemies that used to kick your butt in the past, or prior quests that you had troubles with, when you get stronger, not on this one, the game punishes grinding by making the game easier while forcing it at the same time for the best ending.- The enemies drops waay too much haze (Currency to level up and buy things on this game), while leveling up costs are too low, it is related to the prior opinion on ""the bad"" part, because again you will end up overleveling and feeling overpowered if you do things right, unlike in dark souls where there is no way to overlevel since enemies drop just enough souls to carry/buy stuff and level up on each area, and it doesnt matter if you overlevel especially in DS3, since bosses will kick your ass anyways even after going above level 100-150, and enemies on dark souls 2 will continue making it harder for you by ganking you up, only DS1 get easier by over leveling.Games like dark souls and resident evil 2 made me conservative and forced me to play carefully, not waste items/souls/haze unnecessarily and to use it all the moment i feel danger/boss is comming before commiting a mistake and loosing all the haze i have, the time i feel boss is next, i use all haze to level up before entering boss arena so i dont loose it if i die and then die again without recovering it, thank you dark souls for teaching me this.- This one is again related to haze, there is just not enough items to purchase to use all the haze that enemies start to drop on midgame, the items cost too much on early game then just absolutely nothing when you reach midgame-endgame, buying weapons/blood veils is useless since you get better stuff on drops/advancing on the story, selling items is just decoration right there, they could have done something else to make us use all the haze we get, like making upgrading cost much more for example or make level up cost more. Or by creating a weapon that uses haze to attack enemies, something similar to a prosthetic tool in Sekiro.- If you are not an explorer, and dont really explore in videogames, the areas will feel too short for you, the roads between the start of the area to the boss are waaay too short, making the maps feel small, except the Cathedral (Which i will talk about a little bit later), this game favor exploration only if you want to get the best ending.The Uggly:- The dlcs/season pass, this review is not about them, but i just refused to purchase them due to content not worth the price, even on sales i was thinking for 20 minutes, until i just didnt do it. If you expecting CD Project/Capcom kind of expansions/DLCs you will be disappointed, some people say it was unrealistic from the start but i consider that this guys just dont know how to make good dlcs.- The Anor Londo of this game is the Cathedral of Blood, only this time is even worse, you dont have 2 archers dropping you to death pits this time, but instead you will have to figure out where to drop yourself to advance to the next area, If you dont get frustrated with a level design that requires you to backtrack 40 times while trying to find the path, had a friend that carried you and showed you where to go, or you used guides to find the way out of the cathedral, this may not be very frustrating for you. If you soloed the entire game blind like me, you most likely spent 3 hours or more on the cathedral and hated it.Personal score: 9/10.Personal note: This game is just sooo good, especially if you like both anime concept (Art, movies, games) and dark souls difficulty and gameplay. If you also like highly emotional cutscenes, you gonna love this game.Only problem i have is, that it gets way too easy on midgame if you use the haze to level up, not like i like games that favor grinding but its something that should have been addressed, like patching the enemies drops or creating a hard mode for players to select which make enemies drop 50% less haze.

Recommended,185.8,"																There is one big glaring issue that made me personally give up on this game:There's a huge disconnect between your weapons and enemy reaction and feedback. It's hard to explain but the fighting system feels more like WOW than an action RPG; more like you're just pressing a button and reducing numbers than interactive combat. It doesn't feel impactful and fun like other Japanese action RPGs such as BOTW, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, etc. Regardless of the size and swing of your weapon the enemies stagger in the same way or don't react at all. There's no real feel for the weapons making contact with anything and it makes it all feel non interactive and just about numbers rather than any fluidity or impact. I got no joy or even curiosity to try new weapons outside of stat or effect increases bc nothing felt different except my character animation and speed or type of attack. It isn't like other similar games where sometimes your weapon of choice may not be the best in stats or abilities but it just feels the best to you to use so you main it for the enjoyment. I just don't understand why this wasn't a focus. The game has an amazing and fleshed out character creator  pretty good anime story and writing, with fluid and responsive controls but then you make the combat feel like slicing a hot knife through butter. And in my own personal opinion, the level design and atmosphere aren't good enough to compensate for the combat being a slog. If you're really desperate for anime souls or if this doesn't bother you because you really only care about stats, then I guess you should consider it, but I personally find it fundamentally lacking enjoyment as a game in this genre.

Recommended,45,"																CODE VEIN is an anime souls-like game that heavily draws upon the mechanics, level design, and even bosses found in the highly acclaimed Dark Souls series. While it doesn't reach the same level of excellence as Dark Souls, it stands out in its own way by introducing new ideas. Departing from the traditional stat point allocation system, CODE VEIN introduces blood codes that can be changed at will. Each blood code comes with predetermined stat distributions and offers gifts reminiscent of the miracles and sorcery found in Dark Souls. These gifts are further divided into two types: Passive and Active, which can be mastered and utilized across different blood codes, enhancing the player's versatility.The gameplay experience in CODE VEIN mirrors the challenging nature of Dark Souls. The captivating soundtrack, coupled with a engaging story and well-crafted characters, creates an immersive environment that will particularly resonate with anime enthusiasts. However, the level design is a mixed bag, with some areas reminiscent of the intricately interconnected paths found in Dark Souls, while others prove to be poorly conceived and cumbersome to explore.The cooperative play in CODE VEIN is a truly captivating experience, granting you the opportunity to traverse its world alongside a friend. Bearing similarities to the mechanics found in Dark Souls, the cooperative aspect employs a unique twist. Instead of conventional summon signs, players communicate through signals, allowing a friend to search and seamlessly join forces in your journey.Unfortunately, I had a disappointing experience during my playthrough. I didn't receive the preorder exclusive blood veil, Venous Claw, that was supposed to be available in the deluxe edition. This omission of in-game items feels unfair and takes away from an otherwise great experience.Despite its shortcomings, CODE VEIN remains an exceptional souls-like experience, highly recommended for fans of the genre. Its unique blend of anime aesthetics, compelling gameplay mechanics, and engaging narrative make it a worthwhile venture. I highly recommend CODE VEIN if you're looking for a solo or cooperative souls-like game.9/10			"

Recommended,17.9,"																I'll preface that I played this game before playing any other souls-like games so this was basically my first experience with one. I'm not gonna lie, I initially bought it for the character customization and worried about the actual game when I was playing it. If you care, the character customization is very good.I can't really comment on anime dark souls, mainly because I haven't finished a dark souls game. It's got the same vibe though, with 20 different enemies jumping at you and you dying a non-zero amount of times. The combat has a large variety to it, with loads of different weapons and build options but comes across feeling kinda flat**, and whilst the blood codes are a cool idea, I found myself only really sticking to a few as the game progressed. This game really shines when it comes to the story though, it's very cheesy, but it kinda loops around to become unironically good. Think of a classic cliche anime type story, it's engaging in an endearing way; with lovable characters and classic villains. Everything is very 'turn your brain off and enjoy what's happening', which is probably why I enjoyed it so much as someone very new to the genre at the time.The companion system is weird too, basically you have a partner that joins you and helps you out during the story. Keeping it on makes the game easy and turning it off makes it really hard, there's no real inbetween, so I guess it comes down to what you prefer; It's nice you're given the option though.To summarise, if you're not the most hardcore souls gamer and just looking for a challenging weeb game with a good story, this is a really good game for you. If you're the most hardcore souls gamer and want a game that challenges you with a variety of weapon options and blood code combos, this can be the game for you, if you make sure to turn off your companion and don't walk in expecting a deep lore with a nuanced story that will get you watching explanation lore videos for hours. **When I say flat, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel that satisfying to fight enemies. Maybe I've just been spoilt with Sekiro, but I thought i'd add it anyway.			"
Recommended,124.4,"																How many mazes do you want? -YesCode Vein is anime souls-like game which turned out to be pretty good.Lets start with character creation. It's insanely good, you could spend an hour on customizing your character to your liking, so many options that even AAA rpg's can't compete.So the story is quite interesting and expect some cool cut-scenes, characters and dialogues. As always I don't like speaking of story too much due to spoilers. But expect a well done story and interesting setting. In general story is much better than Dark Souls and so is gameplay.Gameplay is really fun. You can use different codes (like professions) and gifts (skills both passive and active). By combining these you shape your character around your playstyle. You can change these whenever you like so unlike in Dark Souls you're not locked to one build and don't need to restart the game to try another one.You collect memories of other characters and restore them by watching interactive cut-scenes. By progressing through the game you also unlock new codes.You can choose whichever weapon and armor you want and upgrade them.Combat is quite fun although it's not perfect. The controls are responsive enough, combat isn't as clunky and broken as Dark Souls and is more diverse and less boring. You can execute skills, have buffs and use debuffs on enemies. But sometime you could be stuck somewhere or just don't hit the target. But that doesn't happen too often.But the best part is that you have a partner. Usually AI partners suck but not in this game (at least not until the end). Your partner actually is extremely useful and can deal with some enemies alone without your interference. It's also very helpful in boss fights. AI only becomes useless at the very end of the game where it just dies fighting the last bosses and you're left alone. Although your partner still does some damage and helps you before dying a tiny bit.You can change partners whenever you like and each of them is different with their strength's and weaknesses.Usually you'll be navigating through mazes and corridors while collecting vestiges (they restore the memories), opening up the maps and lighting up bonfires. Pretty much how it is in all souls-like games.The downside is that map design is absolutely terrible. One of the worst map designs ever. It feels like someone generated some random mazes and pasted them into the game while building some copy pasta scenery around. One particular (and extremely confusing map) feels like it has been ripped off from Dark Souls but it's nowhere near as good.Graphics are ok, nothing special but not ugly either. Characters look great in both gameplay and cut-scenes. Environment graphics are pretty generic and while objects look ok they are very repetitive.Performance is great, the game ran on locked 100fps even while streaming on max settings. Played on 5800x, rtx3080, 32GB at 3440x1440.Speaking of ultrawide it requires a simple fix but unfortunately no native ultrawide support.Sound design is great. Voice acting is well done and soundtrack is just amazing. Every time you hear the music you don't want for it to stop.Overal a good hack'n'slash game with rpg elements for souls-like fan. It more original then Dark Souls copy pasta and a bit easier although expect a lot of challenge and I don't suggest playing this for people who struggle with difficult games. Other than that it's an easy 7/10.ProsEngaging storyCharacter customizationGameplay is funGifts and codesGreat character design both graphically and thematicallyGreat sound designConsNo native ultrawide supportLaziest map design everBoring, bland sceneryToo difficult at the very endFollow my curator page for more My Twitch [www.twitch.tv]			"

Pretty shortAs a Dark Souls fan, I can highly recommend the game if you want a comparably relaxing ARPG with familiar elements.			"
Recommended,633.6,"																Diary: Code VeinSummaryGameplayQuick gameplay, Parrying, Backstabs, Gimmick level designStoriesGood main story, memories give great backstoryGraphicsAnime Dark Souls, Appealing visual environmentsSoundNice music, impactful sounds of weapons, wonderful executionsControlsNice controls, didn't have to remap. Day 1 - 3/23/2020When first seeing Code Vein, I was drawn in by the cover art and found myself looking at the screenshots and videos to get a better idea of the game. Once I realized this game was like Dark Souls, I knew I had to get it. I spent the first day just working on my character. When I play RPGs, I want to make sure the character I make is someone I will be happy with for my entire playthrough. The game does allow you to change your appearance anytime, but that's beside the point. The great news about the character customization is that it offers so much variety in the ways you can tailor your character. This has resulted in a lot of people recreating their favorite anime characters for the game. You can find many of them posted online. Personally, I prefer making a unique character, though, so I can feel like the journey is tailored to me.Day 2 - 3/24/2020Finally done customizing my character and jumped right into the game, not sure what to expect. It started me off in an area that felt like I was playing the Kingdom Hearts tutorial. I wasn't expecting the gameplay to be so smooth, or the level design to look so good, even though it does feel rather crowded at several points, it does have more open areas later.The amount of customization to your character is nice; instead of it being stat oriented, it has a focus on classes and weapons. Classes have an impact on your performance, for example, I didn't pay much attention, but the classes have their weight limits which influence your attack speed also. So it's something to keep in mind.There is a lot of environmental designs I like in this game, they try to make areas look very different from each other, and it works well here. I love taking advantage of camera mode to get amazing shots.The main plot is good. It's about hunting down the ""source"" and trying to help the revenants, so they aren't starving and losing their minds. The payoffs of the narrative is from the characters, and that becomes apparent when you're going through their memories after finding their fragments in the world. It feels similar to Dishonored, but that's also why I love it so much, it's just a well-implemented idea. The multiplayer is pretty good and a lot more convenient than dark souls. The ability to be able to join your friend as long as you in the same level is a lot better. The only thing that's really required is turning off region lock if they don't live in same area as you, and putting a passcode on and sharing it with your friend. Then boom, all set. Day 3 - 3/25/2020Each area seems to have its gimmick to it, which makes it different from the others. For example, one area, I had to deal with a lot of water that slowed down my movement until I could find the mechanisms to lower the levels. This other area had a lot of verticle exploring, where you would fall from one platform to the next to explore. Then you have one where the gimmick is TONS of ladders, like oh my, am I playing steps and ladders all of a sudden? The memory system continues to impress me and be a welcome change to how character backgrounds are explored. They change it up depending on the situation, so some cinematics will go through the memory for you. So the way they present memories is always mixed up, which is nice. I fought a couple of bosses today, and I have to say I enjoy how they all have multiple stages like that other game that shall not be named. It makes the bosses challenging, and I have died multiple times to these bosses because I'm just awful. Once you learn to get good, though, you'll learn to overcome the challenge, though leveling up and upgrading your equipment also helps a lot too. I have to say, I finally learned how to parry, not sure what's wrong with me but whatever. It's changed up how I fight enemies and made it a lot easier in some cases. Though there does seem to be a slight delay to the parry window, so you have to learn to time it. Lucky for us, they make your character flash for the parry window, so it becomes much easier to adjust to the parry. I've also invested a ton of points into getting new abilities, just for the sake of it. I could have gotten more levels, but I decided it would be nice to have a wide field of variety when it comes to my battle preparations. Now I use mainly 3-4 buffs before I attack anything so that I can demolish things easily. Though sometimes I'm not able to cast as many due to the class I have equipped. PS: Just noticed there is an item in my inventory that lets you teleport to the host of the game at any time, as many times as you want. That would have been nice to know yesterday.Day 4 - 03/26/2020I was going through the snow level today, thinking I couldn't get anymore frustrated with falling off cliffs, now they have fake snow you can fall through. Just what I needed, but on the bright side at least the level was really cool, straight forward and not overly complex.I realized there is a problem with how they did memories in this game for the bosses. If you don't have all the memories you won't be able to get the good ending, so you need to go to Io at home base to double check if you have them all. Io is actually great for figuring out if you have them all or not. I have to say the amount of times I have fallen off the map today, was rage-inducing. I was flipping my lid. If I wasn't falling down holes, walking on ice that broke, or being pushed off by monsters doing barrel rolls. I was still dying to these big boy bosses, my goodness what a day. Day 5 - 3/27/2020I beat another two bosses today, and pretty much unlocked the last part of the game. I have to say this game was totally worth it, and I cannot wait for new game + a couple of times. Day 6 - 3/28/2020Beat the game today, it was quite a fun journey. I really enjoyed the main story and the way they did the backstory for characters, though the side quests could be better. The bosses are really cool, and I'm glad the depths allow us to basically replay nearly all of them with the exception of one in particular. Day 7 - 3/29/2020I was playing CO-OP with my friend again today, and quite frankly, it's just okay. Problem is, the moment you kill the boss in the area with your friend, you cannot be resummoned in that area, so if you wanted to help them with other side quests or collecting things, you're out of luck. That's really lame.At least, it's very simple to join your friend, put a password like dark souls except you don't need to be close to each other to be able to join him at any time. You even get an item to be able to transport to where he is if you had to afk for a bit. 			"

Furthermore, each characters' story line adds weight to their own right, making them equally important as the main protagonist. The way the story is being told has its own merits. Not much of a twist in the story, but it went straight to the point without drags and delays. Though I wished there was more side quests to the side characters (or more interactions with them such as recruiting them as Partners) so we get to know them more.Combat: Acceptable.Bloodcode system: Unique, fun, and creative. Really loved the customisation you can do with it.Dungeon design: Good in overall, but can be better because it is quite linear so there isn't much complexity to it. Though I wished the depths can drop more upgrade materials when we farm the bosses so we can play around with the customisation more (without spending so much time on the farming itself, which can be quite demoralising and repetitive).Monster Design: Unfortunately, bad, as they are repetitive and just a re-skin of the same model.Difficulty Design: Not good, because the real difficulty comes from the game pouring you with lots of monsters all at once. Not a great idea to increase the difficulty by using numbers.Overall: Highly recommended to play this game for its Story, Character design, and Art Style. If these points are what you're looking for, then this would be your cup of tea. Probably not the game for veteran players of Soul series or Elden Ring (as it would be like a cheap version of the two from their perspective). A game worth getting and playing.			"

Recommended,29.6,"																 TL;DR reviews If you like Souls games for the atmosphere and story and don't like anime tropey characters, do not buy this game.If you like Souls games for the combat and expect a level of at least dark souls 1, do not buy this game. Anything else, refer to the following:  Best Aspect  Style and Character Customization The style of Code Vein is very similiar to that of God Eater. Both feature very big anime-esque  weaponry and a morbid apocalyptic setting. Code Vein narrows its focus on a vampire like setting fused with a super solider vibe. The character customization is by far the best customization I have ever seen in a video game. It makes you wish they put as much effort into the rest of the game that they clearly did into the character maker.  Positives  Optimization Obviously I can not speak for weaker builds. I have a 7 year old i5 and a 5 year old nvidia card, and i never dropped below 50v frames at ANY POINT. I've seen in other reviews that they had problems in this department, and I have no idea why. I ran maxed settings minus film grain the entire playthrough and never had any issues.  Characters While you may or may not like some or even any of the characters, its just wrong to say they're one dimensional. The game features an entire mechanic that let's you dig deep into every character's past and learn about how they got be they way they are. This is by far the best part of the story, because the rest mostly falls flat in the end. Skill and Class System Since you do not have rings and equipment in this game besides the one jacket you wear on your shoulders, you instead get a class system. The class system also removes any skilling you would do in a normal souls game by choosing what stat to increase each level. At first, I was not a fan of this system, but after unlocking more classes with more passives and actives I could slap on my class I always used anyways, I realized in the end it provides more customizability and fluidity when playing. Getting tired of using a 2H unga build? Just change class, skills, and weapon and you can play the game entirely differently. You can change as many times as you want as well, so you arent forced to change only 5 times in one playthrough like in Dark Souls 3. While you will have to grind some skills to make them unlockable, when you factor in that in a normal souls game, you would just have to restart the entire game and start from scratch, it balances out as far as time investment goes. Partner System At first, like the class system, I hated this system. I thought it made the game incredibly brain dead for mobbing, and made bosses super easy due to split aggro. Then I realized an important aspect of souls game: mobbing isn't fun. After playing souls games so many times, the more i realized that going through all the areas and killing all the mobs feels more like a task you have to complete to get to the good part of the game, which are the bosses. Since mobbing is never fun, having a partner with you to make it more braindead felt more like a positive to me. You can also turn them off for boss fights, which I did for all but one boss because it changes your ending.  YOU CAN TURN OFF REPETITIVE FOLLOW DIALOGUE IN THE GAME SETTINGS. Negatives  Combat  Combat is incredibly awkward. Through the class system, you have access to every kind of dodge in a souls game: fat roll, fast roll, and Bloodbourne dash. On top of this, the game features multiple attack styles, which I would argue outnumbers a souls game. But it becomes very clear as you play, this ended up being a detriment because none of them feel incredibly ironed out. The combat itself feels incredibly floaty and unimpactful, and if you can't find a weapon type you like, the game feels like a complete dumpster fire. Most enemies tracking is incredibly good, but if you lock on to an enemy yourself, using a 2h weapon for example, and an enemy gets behind you, you will not automatically turn to them and must manually turn yourself. Most bosses feel like ♥♥♥♥, the early ones being the worst offenders. Some bosses are too big and cover your entire screen, making so you couldn't see a wind up even if you wanted to. And the cardinal sin of all Souls games,  THE CAMERA KILLS YOU MORE THAN ANY ENEMY IN THE GAME.  The lock on for bigger or taller enemies is the worst by far, because whoever programmed it didn't put the lock on somewhere on the body that moved little. There are multiple bosses/enemies that fling your camera in 20 directions in a second because the lock on is centered on the torso, where the boss is using its arms to fly all over the place.  Story  The story is incredibly bland, but worst of all its overly complicated. Plot points don't feel like they connect very well, and almost all the god story telling is done through characters. Almost no mechanics are explained outside of the revenants themselves and blood beads. It feels incredibly lazy and forgetful about certain universal mechanics, and sometimes just blatantly ignores aspects of the story.  And if you can watch the scene where Yakumo pulls a gun randomly on the random revenant that kidnaps that human girl, you must have some nerves of steel.  THE ABSOLUTE WORST ASPECT  ""Invasions"" For some horrible, god-forsaken reason, instead of having NPC fights in a game where they very clearly [i/]have character combat AI, the game drops NPC invasions or fighting completely. Instead, you get invaded by waves of normal mobs that are only different because they're hyper aggressive. As mentioned before, mobbing in souls games is not fun, so why they developers thought having waves of enemies running at you, three at a time, would be any fun for anyone ever, is beyond any reasoning I can think of. And the very worst part is,  THE REWARDS ARE NEGLIGIBLE TRASH.  Final Numbers All in all, the game feels like a solid 5 to 7 out of 10, depending on your love for the setting, design, and characters. I would but it for 30 to 35 dollars only, nothing higher. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE DLC, THEY ARE OVERPRICED ALL GARBAGE 			"

Recommended,43.3,"																I started playing Code Vein expecting it to be another Souls game but with waifus as a bonus, but boy was I wrong (not about the waifus though, they are fantastic). From the character creator (which I'm sure some people can easily spend over an hour just creating their character) to the atmosphere, visuals and story, everything was fantastic. Speaking of story, Code Vein has undoubtedly the best one among the Souls-like games imo. I suggest trying to find all the  vestiges aka memories  to find out even more about the world, your companions, side characters,...The only (minor) negative thing I can say about this game is that it can be more challenging than regular souls-game mainly because of its (kinda) different approach to classes & builds. For instance, leveling up does not increase your character's damage at all. But after figuring out how they work, there shouldn't be any further issues.Highly recommended			"
Recommended,142.9,"																Dark souls but anime, except some stuff in the game makes it incredibly unfair.If you don't level up too much and keep yourself low level then you can level up blood code gifts really fast just by killing enemies in lower level areas, which incentivizes not leveling up too much. Doing so makes the game really difficult when it comes to doing the actual story. Multiplayer levels the guest to around the host's level, meaning if you are level 125 and join somebody who is level 15 you will be level 20. Enemies you normally one shot now become multi-hit enemies. The host would need to be convinced to level up, but if they are power farming their blood code gifts then they will refuse most of the time because they won't be able to level them as fast. Boss fights go from okay to borderline impossible and unfair. The guest can't interact with anything that would help the host, such as dropping ladders or opening chests. The use of Mistles becomes completely removed if there is a guest currently in the game. The use of certain items such as regen activation factor and regen extention factor becomes removed if somebody else is in your game, making it so you can't become a little bit stronger. Guests have their regeneration charges halved (from what I can tell). Guests have no way to restore their regeneration without leaving the session, which has the funny term of ""cease cooperation"", and rejoining. The NPC companions you can pick from tend to screw you over more than actually help you by pulling agro from enemies you don't want to agro if you are just running through an area to go somewhere specific. They also draw agro from bosses, which is completely random and will often make boss attacks harder to dodge since they aren't aimed at you and you will need to time your dodges differently and some attacks will become dead angles so you can no longer block them. Some of the NPC companions are also stupidly strong. People normally say Yakumo is the best companion, but when it comes to actual utility and versatility Io is the best all around. She has huge damage, good support, and can dish out good melee damage, ranged damage, and survive really well. The levels range from ""cake walk"" to ""literally half of your play time"" in terms of difficulty, size, or both.Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is a massive level that is usually seen as the casual player filter due to it's enormous size and the enigma that is the pathways you can take. You will, without a doubt, spend more than 2-4 hours going through there for the first time.The English voice acting is at best mediocre. The characters sound emotionless half the time. Io is an exception because that's pretty much just her character. If you want to play and have good voice acting then switch the spoken voice to Japanese. Even if you don't understand it you will at least have emotion in the voices.Code Vein and God Eater share the same universe, as revealed through one of the later boss fights. Io is precious, and you should protect her.			"

It's a really good game, despite it's flaws. At times it feels like it tries to pay homage to Dark Souls, but flops miserably (for example, BB&C and the Cathedral).

Recommended,48.9,"																TLDR: For a casual experience, Code Vein is pretty engaging, but not very interesting.If you’re coming from the Dark Souls franchise, don’t expect the same experience here. Code Vein is a good game, however it’s definitely meant for more casual players.The premise is good and actually quite unique. Unfortunately, the game wants to tell you *everything* about the backstory of *every* character while introducing plot points that are rarely mentioned again. Everyone in this game has a backstory and for some reason the game wants you to learn EVERYONE’s backstory through a required (though luckily skippable) game mechanic which gets old fast.It’s a stark contrast with Dark Souls where if you want to learn anything you need to find secrets and piece things together yourself. Speaking of…There are no secrets in this game, which is a huge disappointment. Since levels are fairly linear, all items can always be accessed if you just keep walking.Character creation is actually pretty good. Would’ve preferred more clothes options because, no, high heels are not combat ready. It’s still much better than Cyberpunk’s.Controls were bad. Code Vein shoehorned in its own ability system which throws the tried-and-true Dark Souls controller configuration out the window. If you have a controller with back paddles, rebind the ability menu to one of those so you can move sprint to b and heavy/light attacks to R1/R2.Travel between areas is interconnected like Dark Souls 1, with Dark Souls 3 teleportation thrown in there from the start. It’s not bad, but it still makes it too easy to “safe zone hop.”Locations are interesting, but the level design is fairly bland. It can be boiled down to hallways with stairs with the occasional shortcut you can enable. I’m also 90% sure that the game uses the long hallways to hide loading times.Animation was decent. Things like hair and clothes kept phasing through solid objects which was a bit annoying to see. The big issue I had was that characters just looked stiff and uncomfortable when doing literally anything. Mouths especially barely seemed to have any range of movement while speaking, which may explain why everyone wears a gas mask all the time.Enemies also have a weird tendency to move at a good 20 fps when in the distance.Combat is fine but not as fluid as Dark Souls. Even with the large, over the top weapons I never felt like I had enough range. Enemy AI is pretty decent. There wasn’t a ton of last minute auto-targeting where an enemy will wind up for an attack and change direction mid-swing. Kudos to the devs for understanding how inertia works. Boss AI is fairly balanced between heavy and vulnerable attacks, however they may be a bit too easy for those familiar with soulsborne games.A gimmick I found obnoxious is that you always have a party member with you. The game actually seems to be designed around this as most enemies require two hits to stun. TO make things worse, there’s no way to command your ally. So if you’re trying to stealth a section, the companion’s AI will go “HMM ENEMY” and initiate combat.Fanservice was a bit much at times. Yes it’s anime, no that doesn’t mean I want it in my face all the time. This is why we can’t have nice things.Overall, Code Vein is good. It’s not the anime-styled dark souls I wanted, but it passes.			"
Recommended,124.5,"																The Gist of itCode Vein is a third person combat heavy experience, designed around the concept of “trial and error”, all wrapped in an Anime aesthetic. Players are constantly walled by tougher and tougher enemies with differing resistances, weaknesses, attack patterns, abilities, and spells. Learning the mechanics and how the game handles even the littlest of details, as well as the visual and audio cues during fights, is crucial for success.Isn’t this like...I feel I should preface my full thought piece by stating where I stand with the “Souls-like” genre: I’ve never played a single one, in any capacity, so I have no real frame of reference (for better or for worse) in regards to what would entail a good Souls game. For the sake of this review, even if I did play one, I’d try to explain what Code Vein is on its own merit, and not just write another Souls spiel. In short, if you’re looking for a review that encompasses what this game does well that others of the genre do and vise versa, this won’t be an informative read I’m afraid.With all that said, if this is indicative of what this genre has to offer, I’m 100% into it.A Revenant’s PleaThis tale begins with our hero/heroine confined in a void, trapped with a woman. After going through her tutorial, our warrior awakens to the sight of a woman. She is simply called Girl in White at this point in our story, (her name is Io, and she’s best girl just saying) and both make their way over to a tree of some kind, walking through a seemingly desolate city. Its only moments later, that it becomes painfully clear they’re not alone, and shortly after they become unwilling scavengers.The game progressively gets more interesting, but this foundation weaves a tapestry of a woeful world fighting to get by day to day. CV slowly introduces the concept of what our protagonist and most every other living sane beings are: Revenants. Creatures of endless death and rebirth, constantly thirsting  for blood, else they lose their minds and become one with the ranks of The Lost, which are the creatures that appose our leading Revenant. In true Anime fashion, the protagonist is the world’s only hope and holds the power to help mitigate the suffering of those who haven’t lost themselves. Through their travels, our hero/heroine and Co. make new friends, and reminisce old ones using one of the protagonist’s many unique abilities. Our protagonist can read latent memories from Vestiges that happen to be laying around, or from certain enemies. This serves as a decent means of giving both context to what has happened in this world, who was involved, expanding on character lore, and unlocking Blood Codes which I will come back to momentarily."

Not Recommended,26.3,"The story as a whole is… Serviceable. It isn’t inherently bad or doomed to fail and I did enjoy it here and there, I just have a few gripes with how events sometimes play out. For one, sometimes the friendship moments were layered on too thick for my liking. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the player believe that these people are truly your friends, and that’s fine and all, I would just rather it not be so forced. Another issue I have is with the progression of the story, with the goal mostly being a back and forth and not much else. There are loads of cool enemies to fight in between, and the story picks up a few hours in though so I was able to cope.Codes for SuccessThroughout the game, players will unlock what is effectively classes that govern what abilities and spells can be used, known as Blood Codes. Each code offers a set of abilities and skills that can be unlocked for use with other codes in a sort of mix and match style, by either having them equipped with the class or outright buying them out. The codes also affect other combat abilities, such as the armor and weapons one can equip, and what spells/buffs can be used. Essentially, each Blood Code has its own letter grade in a given category and as long as the ability/spell requirements fit, and it has been unlocked, you can use it! Some abilities and spells are just locked to their parent code and can’t be shared, usually for game balance purposes.Overall PerformanceThe game performed somewhat optimally with all settings at their highest value, at 60 FPS. Any higher FPS value and things like elevators wouldn’t work correctly. I didn’t want to keep switching so I stuck with 60, and that was more than sufficient.Very rarely, aside from the last few levels, turning corners too fast would allow me to see beyond the area or room, until the area loaded in. Rather Jarring, and thankfully didn’t hinder gameplay.PC Specs:CPU – Ryzen 9 5900xGPU – GIGABYTE RTX 3080RAM – 2 x 16 DDR4Storage – SSDIn Conclusion...At the end of the day, I can say I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn’t quantify it as 10/10 or anything like that, probably not even 8/10, but I like this game enough to say with confidence that if other souls games are like this I’m interested in trying them. Most of my disdain at first came from my lack of understanding what this game is really trying to do. I can’t see any reason to not recommend this on a decent sale. 60 USD, at the time of this review’s publishing, is unacceptable and would be the only real reason I’d recommend against buying this.If'n you liked this review, want to see what else I have opinions on, or just want to read more from me, check out my curator, Plebby's Place.

Not Recommended,8.9,"																Sum-UpIn-depth analysis further down.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons• Excellent character editor, that allows creating the anime character of your dreams in the finest detail.• Solid build variety thanks to how progression is designed; mix and match to create custom classes.• Good QoL features: fast travel always available, an actual map, item auto-refill from storage, and more.• Horrendous co-op implementation that doesn’t allow fully experiencing the game together, as clients don’t get several items and can’t use bonfires.• Parry feels clunky due to bizarre animation delays in-between actual parry frames, while backstabbing simply doesn’t trigger correctly half the time.• 70% of all passive and active skills of the various “classes” are gimmicky or useless. Only comparatively few are worth maxing out.• Repetitive enemy design, especially in the second half of the campaign. Post-endgame content also relies on recycled bosses and enemies, and is a useless grindfest.• The animations to cast any offensive spell, heal, or get anything done are ridiculously long compared to the general pacing, and can’t even be canceled if needed.• Poor boss design that has only two types of bosses: pushovers you’ll clear on your first try (without overleveling), or enormous AoE / ranged attack spammers that will prove painful.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs• Camera handling is terrible with larger enemies and in cramped spaces - you will die because of it.• UI to equip gear and weapons lacks any type of sorting beyond category, it does become a clusterf**k later on.• i5 11400H• 16GB RAM DDR4• 512 GB SSD• RTX 3060 6GB• 1080pContent & Replay Value:It took me around 38 hours to complete Code Vein, taking extra time to explore all locations accurately. I didn’t complete all post-endgame optional content, however. Despite the presence of NG+, the content is linear and its replay value negligible.Is it worth buying?Not really. The price of 50€ is in line with this production value and content amount, however the mediocre quality and its numerous flaws don’t make it a worthwhile purchase; there are many better (and cheaper…) souls-like out there.Verdict: MediocreRating Chart HereDespite solid visual design and some good innovations for the genre, Code Vein ultimately proves to be a lackluster, poorly-thought-out souls-like not worth your time."

Recommended,238.8,"In-DepthWriting & WorldbuildingAfter the world got absolutely totaled due to the appearance of nightmarish creatures, the few surviving humans are on the run for their life; near-immortal, blood-sucking individuals known as Revenants battle each other and the monsters over precious resources. With a typical ‘deus-ex-machina’, you happen to be the only revenant whose blood code is ‘special’; this unique feat will soon gather a following, and embark you on a quest to retrieve certain artifacts.Most characters you’ll encounter won’t be totally uninteresting, but also won’t show any real development past their initial archetypes, either, thus being one-sided in the long run. The story itself feels more than anything a Dark Souls ripoff with vampires added to the mix, but none of the great pathos and evocative setting, and isn’t really interesting at any point.The anime-style, cel-shaded visuals are modern enough to be pleasant, even if they don’t have the detail of other titles with similar production value released in the same year. Artistically, CV is a success, with most locations feeling unique and visually-appealing - too bad for that Anor Londo plagiarism, which was sad to witness.Exploration & SecretsSave for a few specific cases, most locations in Code Vein will play out as linear levels that won’t really have any interconnection or shortcut between them. Sure, you can teleport in-between Mistiles (bonfires) at any time, but the world feels detached, incohesive, as if each stage wasn’t part of a larger picture in any sense. As customary, there will be secondary areas in each zone, oftentimes housing unique items, memories of departed revenants, resources and even fearsome Invasions, which are just a truckload of normal enemies coming all at once, really.Exploring is enjoyable for the most part, however the power creep is noticeable and you likely won’t have a lot of problems clearing out entire areas once you get stronger and have access to upgraded weapons and armor. That feeling of dread, not being able to reach the next bonfire before you’re exhausted, typical of souls games, won’t be common here. The fact CV includes a map is great, something more souls games could have, however said map lacks height levels, so it becomes a bludgeoned mess when you’re exploring highly vertical locations."

Recommended,48.6,"Combat System & ProgressionThe combat plays out in third person, with the general canons of Souls games as baseline: dodge, block, parry and backstab your way through levels crowded with respawning enemies, with or without the aid of a companion, keeping an eye on status effects, stamina and limited healing. If you choose to be ‘hardcore’ and play solo, consider that most levels are designed for a companion to play with you, so don’t be surprised when you’ll get gang-banged by 8 angry pepes and stunlocked to death - your companions can revive you a number of times, and you can do the same with them as long as there's HP to sacrifice.You’ll be able to get all classes at once and even create your own in CV. Unlike most Souls games which focus on a single playstyle for a “run”, Code Vein has Blood Codes that dynamically can be swapped to alter your stats, abilities and playstyle. The unique abilities of each blood code can also be mastered, and used in other ones at will. A great amount of possibilities is there for those willing to experiment, but this comes as a double-edged sword, sacrificing replay value massively.You’ll gain items, weapons and souls from defeated enemies, pickups and the occasional quests, which usually entail fetching a specific item or clearing a marked enemy on the map. The upgrade system for your character and for gear is straightforward and in-line with other Souls games, with the exception of Blood Code talents which are leveled up in a “use to master” fashion.Combat plays out fine at surface level, but its biggest weaknesses are general inconsistency, and clunkiness of animations. It feels off, unresponsive and frustrating to handle, even with a controller. The ridiculous animation lengths will be your death, as in some cases you won’t even be able to heal in time for how long it takes. Forget playing a caster or ranged class, since mana in CV is only gained with limited consumables or by striking enemies in melee; no matter your class, you’ll have to go melee eventually - pretty soon actually - all for using spells that aren’t worth the trouble."

Recommended,201,"																This is by far my favorite game I played in 2020.I kept away from it for a long time because it was expensive and because word on the street was that it was just a jankier anime dark souls, and tbh I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ burnt out on the souls formula. But as it turns out, this is a game that's fantastic because it's not afraid to NOT be Dark Souls and instead embraces having its own personality and soul.The combat is much speedier, more in line with Bloodborne, but faster still and with the potential for even more expansive and stylish movesets. Some people have said it lacks impact, but that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥: the animations and hit sfx are all snazzy and on point. On top of that you get devious maze-like level design that feels more like something out of an oldschool action jrpg like ys 1&2. Complimenting that oldschool feel is the emphasis on working alongside npc's partners at all times, which gives the game a sort of jrpg party feel and frees up the fights to be larger scale and more chaotic while simultaneously more flexible and forgiving.But what really sold me on it all was the characters and story. A friend of mine sold me on it by telling me that all the main characters are convincingly good people, and that's where the game really shines. Underneath it's delightfully edgy and chuuni exterior, Code Vein has a heart of gold. It's thematically more in line with optimistic, oldschool affairs like Chrono Trigger than Dark Souls, as the characters work to better a grim world and strive for real, actual hope. And it's all played without the slightest hint of irony, because above all else Code Vein has a sense of sincerity and earnestness that makes the whole thing come together and feel heartfelt.Don't compare it to Dark Souls, or if you do, think of it as the spiritual antithesis. But honestly? From the combat and mechanics to the story and theme, the game now appeals to me way more than anything Fromsoft has ever made.			"

The human civilization is in total ruin, and the only survivors are the so-called Revenants – vampires with superpowers who live in a community known as Vein. Its members abandoned their humanity and most of their memories to survive in a new, harsh reality. However, they are far from accepting their fate and try to unfold the secrets of the fallen world. They must also suck blood regularly, or they will transform into blood-lusting monsters.During world exporing we will find a lot of new friends which we can help to find Vestiges. Collecting them all allows us to know their mysterious past and restore their memories.GameplayThe gameplay of Code Vein takes after the tradition of the Dark Souls series. We exploring locations that aren’t clearly separated and fighting with various enemies, including powerful bosses. There is also the blood-sucking mechanic that plays a major part in the game, and is implemented by using Blood Veil, which also acts as an armor. After successful Drain Attack, we will gain Ichor which allows us to use Gifts – special abilities with various effects, ranging from strengthening our character, through weakening enemies, up to direct attacks on them. Blood Veil appears in many shapes and forms, as do characters’ skills and weapons, letting us use various strategies.One of the important elements of Code Vein is a system that lets us play with an AI-controlled companion. We select the companion from non-playable heroes, who become more numerous as we progress through the game. This allows us to complete tasks that would be too much of a challenge for a single adventurer. However, our friend isn’t just there to help us in combat – he can аct by himself and his actions might result in situations which will require our support.Audio and SoundtracksThe game is fully voiced and the Japanese voices are pretty damn good.

I bought Code Vein because I enjoy the souls gameplay loop and the challenge in overcoming difficult games.Sometimes I hate being a part of the weeb community as it invalidates all your opinions to anyone who isn't into the anime aesthetics.

Progression is very good, I was very happy with the level design and visuals, I AM more easily satisfied than most people however (don't take that out of context).

My opinion remains largely the same, but I'll add a few more notes and revise where appropriate.Code Vein wants so badly to be anime Dark Souls, but the combat, enemy variety, and world building fall flat.The GoodCharacter Creator:I'm not going to lie, I spent hours in the character creator. Once you learn to use the system to layer elements and disable/combine layers of preset outfits, you can create a surprising variety of characters. I made a couple close approximations of characters from other games or series I liked for fun before settling on my final design.You can go back and tweak it at any time, too. They clearly put a lot of love into this feature and it shows.Character and Weapon Aesthetics:Assuming you are into the style, the character design and equipment are all nicely done. The women are ridiculously proportioned and costumed in many cases, though. I'm chalking that up to ""because anime.""The BlandCombat:The systems are the same basic Souls-esque functionality you're used to by now. Vertical attack (fast), Horizontal attack (slow), Block, Parry, etc. It's not ground-breaking, but it mostly does the job. Some movesets feel clunky and the overall execution doesn't always feel as snappy as it should.The drain mechanic is sort of interesting, but ends up feeling like a chore to get yourself back up to a functional level after each death. Turn on the option in the game menus to disable the cinematic drain camera, trust me, the novelty wears off fast.Music:There aren't really any bangers here. The soundtrack is generic and forgettable with the exception of a couple tracks in the end credits.Most of the time outside of cinematics all you'll hear is ambient noise or the same repeated ""enemies are near"" or ""battle"" tracks.Multiplayer:Nobody is ever around for multiplayer. I've tried searching many, many times and joined another player exactly once. They promptly died after I joined them and that was the end of that. I have no idea what multiplayer is like because it may as well not exist.The BadOptimization:I've got a beast of a machine and sometimes this game just craps out for no reason. This was worse before upgrading, but now I'm up to relatively high tier specs and it still performs poorly at times. Good luck if you're trying to play around minimum recommended specs.This is a poorly-optimized console port. You'll especially feel that when alt-tabbing; Code Vein really hates to lose focus.Enemies:You've got your melee grunt, shooty boi, heavy hitter, and then a few miscellaneous beasts with little HP and minmal damage. That's mostly it; the game just reskins them and sometimes gives them an ability or a dominant element/status effect. The AI is not very bright and you can pretty much just breeze through anything other than mobs of enemies.The hardest thing you're going to have to deal with are probably the ice berserker things in the snow area. Just use fire to knock them out of iceball mode, problem solved.Skill Unlocks:Skill unlock cutscene areas are a giant time sink, and at a bare minimum you are required to load into each zone, then load back out for every set of skills you unlock. Instead of just showing things in a pre-structured cinematic, you have to actually walk through a little gallery area at slow walking speed. You cannot skip segments or go faster than the native pacing of the scene, you can only skip it all or walk through it all.Partners:The game is balanced for you to have a partner, but having an AI partner trivializes most encounters as they split aggro, deal damage, heal you, and take care of ranged things for you.Playing without a partner leaves you vulnerable to one-shot damage nonsense revealing that the healing mechanic is a crutch implemented to make the monsters hit hard enough to provide a semblance of challenge when running with a partner, but that encounters weren't scaled for unpartnered forays.Then don't even get me started on the repeated voice lines...Level System:Levels don't matter until late game. In fact, leveling puts you at a disadvantage for grinding out skill affinity to unlock things for use in other codes. Once I learned that, I stopped leveling up at all. I played the majority of the game at level 16 and I'm pretty sure I could have just never leveled at all and been fine. Just keep your gear up to date and use a decent build, you'll be fine.Post-Completion note: I made it up through the final boss of the Crypt Spire before leveling past 16. I believe finishing the game at 16 would have been doable, but adding 160 levels with the couple million haze I was sitting on did ultimately add a significant HP buffer and damage increase using scaling equipment at higher tiers, which hastened completion.Environment Design:The areas you visit are by and large open, bland, and uncomplicated. The path will take you where you need to go.The notable exception is the white Anor Londo rip-off area. That place is a frustrating maze where everything looks the same. Have fun with that if you need to backtrack or track down something you missed.NPC Interactions:Ugh. The writing is terrible here. Also, nobody moves their mouth while talking unless it's during a significant cinematic scene, despite this being released in 2019. Weird.Despite all of the cinematics, the pretense of friendship, and the tragic backstories of characters, you're probably not going to walk away caring about them at all, or what happens to them.ConclusionWould I recommend this game? Only if you are really hard-up for a Souls-like to fill your time, you like the anime aesthetic, and only if it's on a substantial sale. It's a fairly bland but acceptable offering in the genre that'll kill time if you're bored, but it's not exciting or memorable.Code Vein never really gets to a level where you feel engaged, and it never hits that sweet spot in terms of difficulty that we see in From Software titles.Overall rating 3/5. There are better things to spend your money on.			"

Recommended,68.2,"																Pros and Cons:+ You start with a lead pipe.+ You can do this game at level 1.( I don't recommend a level 1 lead pipe only run)- It's too easy when you're not level 1.- Game is not explained too well+ Game can be figured out and learned for all of its mechanics pretty quickly+ You can make characters that are pretty when they stand still.- Characters with accessories (hair extensions) will not look as pretty when moving.- You will almost never hear your character except for a few reactions to being destroyed.+ I once fought and beat a samurai by rolling in his face while he attacked and attacked him hoping I countered on the right string.+ Fire Bad.+ Female Boss Design- Male Boss Design+ Kill the animals+ Characters feel alive...- Characters feel alive during cut scenes only- Co-op is you, an NPC if you want, and another person.+ Co-op is easy to set upVerdict:Don't compare this to the Dark Souls series other than the maker and the expecting to die aspect.If you want freedom in a game, this isn't for you. If you want a story that you can casually follow while throwing yourself into some challenge every now and then, you should consider this title and buy it on sale.If you have money to blow and a lot of time to suffer (yes, suffer) if you're stuck at home, buy it.So, if this game had a part 2 what would it look like?			"
Recommended,2.3,"																IntroCode Vein is a souls-like ARPG known as Waifu Souls. It is fun and I like it, though I admit I like anime waifus and big anime tities the most. That said, this game has some very rough edges bringing down the experience. If you seek quality souls-like game, those are the dealbreaker.StoryCode Vein follows up the Great Collapse in God Eater. I can tell it is a very typical anime story even I don't watch anime. Basically, you are a special one. You meet friends on your journey and with their help, you find your goal and achieve it. It is like a cliché teenage adventure and suffers from stereotypical characterizing, per se, you have a passionate character like fire, you have a calm and warm-hearted character etc., just like every anime has. Even so, I still enjoy the story. It is well-structured and well-told. Characters are developed and fleshed out with their backstory. The game also has three endings, all of them are beautiful in their ways.Japanese anime tends to try so hard to be emotionally appealing and sometimes it becomes a little awkward, unnatural, and even pretentious. It is a thing in Code Vein as well, but I don’t take that as an issue as I know that is what Japanese scriptwriters tend to do. Just don’t take it seriously.PresentationUnlike the dark story setting, the game uses vibrant color tones. It looks good and fits the anime anesthetic. However, the lighting is slightly oversaturated, so colors are a bit too warm and not displayed 100% correctly, despite most people won’t notice. Besides, drain attack will split blood on screen, which is odd as it normally preserves for getting hurt.Speaking of anime anesthetic, it is a thing you either love it or hate it. I did sense some uncanny valley during character customization, but overall I think it looks cool, and the waifus and big boing boing really speak my language. By the way, customization is very abundant. You will have fun if you like building your waifu sort of thing, but you might have to look elsewhere for something realistic.This game uses lots of icons to keep the interface clean and artistic. However, it is not efficient for obtaining information, as you have to look it up to know what it stands for. Plus, the interface layout doesn’t have a focus point. You don’t know where to put your eyeballs with this messy layout, making it hard to simply look at. The two actually make the RPG system extra confusing.RPG SystemCode Vein has the most complicated, confusing and underutilized RPG system I have ever seen in this genre. You need to equip blood code (character class) to distribute stats and acquire abilities, and also need certain weapon and armor types to maximize the efficiency of each blood code.I appreciate options, but it is a hurdle when there are too many. The game has 30+ blood codes, but many of which don’t play out that differently. On top of that, each blood code has different abilities (200+ presumably) and many are alike or useless. Once reach maximum proficiency, they can be equipped across different blood code, so you get much more complicated combinations to worry about. Plus, most people probably will just stick with a few and leave most unused for there are too many, causing it underutilized.Additionally, I don’t know why the game makes proficiency harder to reach as you level up. It is like the game inspires creativity but also repeals you from doing so.The gear part is confusing. You pick weapons and armors according to the vague description of each blood code. To see if they fit your build, you look at the hard-to-look-at character interface and you have lots of stats to worry about, unlike other games that only have straightforward metrics like damage, defence etc. Good luck figuring those out.Due to how complicated and confusing it is, I have no idea how to do an optimal build. I think heavy build is superior for the way enemy and combat are designed, from which you can see each part of the game doesn’t glue together that well since certain builds shouldn't be  “advantageous”.Map DesignCode Vein implements a large, continuous map design like Dark Souls, but allows teleportation across savepoints for it has so many diverging paths that need backtrack. Before I play, I have heard many complaints about map design. It is indeed not good.First, most maps are the same feature-wise though they look different. Second, the game has so many narrow corridors, which is a bad combination with the enemy design. Third, where to set savepoint is not coherent. Last, each map is a confusing labyrinth that hard to keep track on. You have to remember EVERY exit you encounter for not missing loots and staying on track. Scared Blood Cathedral and Flaming Street are the worst maps I have seen. Because of high environmental similarity and many paths, these two are atrociously disorienting.Enemy DesignOne thing I like is the game has many female enemies (not just bosses). It is a breath of fresh air compared to most souls-like games feature dull and generic male enemies. Apart from that, boss design is decent, but DLC bosses are broken. They are what is called “fighting Monster Hunter boss with Dark Souls mechanics”.I often feel cheated by how it makes evasion ineffective. MOST enemies have ludicrous attack range. They can do 270-degree attacks or even 360. I don’t know the exact distance because many times even it looked like I was out of the distance, enemies still hit me. My guess is two to three back rolls depending on enemy types, which is a lot. Due to these, heavy build is preferred as you simply can’t dodge. Even worse, most enemies walk in packs. You can’t separate them on many occasions. Remember I talk about the game’s fetish with narrow corridors? Good luck fighting them in narrow space.Additionally, a few enemy types give you less than a second to react before attack, and attack can go through other enemy bodies and things like pillars. Yeah, fun.CombatAs a YouTuber said, this game is stupidly easy until some bullsh*it happens, especially because you have AI companion. But bullsh*it happens, including companion bugging out, like running off, doing dismal damage, or just rolling; enemy packs in small space; enemy waves; disadvantage spots forcing to face enemy hordes head-on; beefed up high attack elites. Artificially creating difficulty spikes in such lame ways is just not how a souls-like game should be difficult. Hitbox issue also happens a lot. Even an attack lands on the enemy’s face, it doesn’t register as a hit.Combat is very hectic since you often encounter 3+ enemies simultaneously, from which you can see influence from previous hack and slash titles. But as a souls-like game, it means raw. It isn’t like other sophisticated titles you can dance around and calculate every move. You just smash buttons and beat the sh*it out of them as fast as possible (heavy build is good for it), otherwise they pile up. Again, I don’t think it is the way to make a souls-like game. For the same reason, I find myself and many others did not utilize parry and drain attack very well, as both require timing that enemies don't give you. It sort of reflects how enemy design is not coherent with combat mechaics.The camera is problematic. It is too close. When getting close to big enemies, it almost sinks inside their bodies and you can’t see, especially in narrow space. And it happens a lot. Also, when a locked-on enemy thrusts or jumps, the camera spins drastically. The sudden spin not only is extremely uncomfortable but also makes you move in the wrong direction. You can experience two issues together when facing giant bosses like the final boss and DLC bosses.VerdictI really had fun with Code Vein, but I can’t help to critique the sh*it out of it because it is not how you make a souls-like game. Anyway, what do I know. I hope it will have an improved sequel.			"

Recommended,87.7,"																Rating: 8.5/10Genre: JRPG THE GOOD: + A robust set of options and clean interface to customization your character. I was very surprised just how good the character creator was given the type of game. This game has a better character creator than most other RPG’s that need one. + A variety of weapons, armor, classes and skills to fit any character build. Even better, you can mix & match anything you want so long as you meet the stat requirements. This is a flexible system because you are never locked into any one build. You could play a melee build, realize its not for you and switch over to a caster or range build. Choices are endless and with over 150 skills there is plenty of room for experimentation. + Like any other ‘souls’ game combat plays out very similarly, you have light and heavy attacks, blocking and parrying and most skills feel satisfying to use. Almost any character build is viable. + The story is decent, finding items allows you to revisit people’s memories which in turn unlocks new skills for you to use. It would be hard not to mention that given the post apocalyptic setting, the women wearing skimpy clothing and absurdly large breasts feels very out of place.   + The mixed environments with solid level design you always feel rewarded for exploring the map, whether its new items, weapons or unlocking a new shortcut. One particular map, Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is a sprawling level filled with walkways and spiral staircases that often feel confusing to navigate but also very rewarding when you unlock new shortcuts and make real progress. I particularly like how the mini map is blacked out until you find a checkpoint which then fills in a particular aspect of the map. It’s a great technique so that you don’t overly rely on the mini map to navigate the environment but also gives you a good incentive to explore and reach the next checkpoint. + You have a choice of an AI partner who will aid you in combat. The game is designed around 2 people but those looking for a challenge can also play solo. Your partner is incredibly competent, they will use skills, dodge, revive you when needed, attack the enemy. Not once did I ever feel frustrated by their presence.  THE AVERAGE:+/- Side quests have people telling you to collect an item or kill a monster which results in average item rewards at best. +/- Certain in-game gameplay mechanics could be explained better. CONCLUSION:This is a solid, more accessible ‘souls’ type game. Its easier than your typical ‘souls’ game but that doesn’t mean it’s a walk in the park either. This game finds the right balance between fun and challenging. Highly recommended for any fans of the genre. 			"
Recommended,16.7,"																Anime Dark Souls is an amazing game!For someone new playing souls-like games this was surprisingly really fun, the character creation has so many options to choose from, literally spent a good hour and a half editing. The story is well explained in time and almost everything you are told connects with each other. There's also many different types of blood codes, veils, gifts and weapons to change your overall play style.The only thing I despise is the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood.			"

Recommended,143.1,"																Yet another but not that mediocre Dark Souls clone, but this time in anime style. Code Vein got everything you love (and so do I): a simple combat system that hasn't changed much since Demon Souls; cute girls with big tidies; Warhammer 40k style weaponry - extra huge and pompous guns and melee weapons that the Emperor himself would envy; and STALKER themed respirators but with a bit edgy design. There are lots of features that were kindly used from Dark Souls series, besides PVP(there’s simply no PVP). If you’re keen on souls like games, then this game is a good choice especially if you don’t mind anime, and its cliches like extremely unnecessary nudity, impractical weaponry and armory, and way too big anime boobies. However, if you’re fed up with anime related stuff and especially its ecchi, then it’s better to refrain from buying this game. But if you’re looking for some not that hard and punishing souls like coop game without PVP, then this game is a fine choice. Overall combat, animations, cutscenes, lore, plot, soundtrack and especially character customization are really nice. The game’s soundtrack and character customization worth a separate review. Of course, the lore and characters’ backstory are not that deep and well-written in comparison with Dark Souls franchise, but still, I can’t consider it bad, just not that memorable, but good enough to immerse you in the world of Code Vein. In short, I do recommend this game for ppl who are looking for good, but not that challenging coop experience. Advantages-Way too beautiful soundtrack that highly suits to the game’s mood. (I personally think this souls inspired game has the best ost among souls like clones)-Smooth and various combat animations, the animations are nicely done overall. Each weapon has unique several animations, not to mention some active attack gifts for each Blood Code and different finishers. -Quite unique lore and characters backstory, you may think the game’s story is meh, butyou’ll find out the game’s world building is above average if you delve into the story.-Various builds that may diversify gameplay a little. You can also easily change to another build at any time due to simplicity of leveling up your character. -Good voice acting. Well, it’s no match to Dark Souls level, but still VA actors did really descent job. Many voice options in character customization.-Extremely content rich character customization, that offers tons of ways to make your character stand out amongst the others + has great potential in cosplay making. You can easily spend a few hours in creating a character of your dream or your favorite character from tv show.-Well, it may be controversial, but the game has its unique aesthetic which is far from either medieval design of Dark Souls series or steampunk style of Bloodborne. Art style is strongly inspired DMC & God Eater series, but may be a bit edgy.-Brings in the new concept of blood veils, that allow to use special drain attacks within their normal attacks to get their ichor back, which is used to cast magic and use special abilities. -You can change your build anytime you feel like it. If you’re done being typical tankie swordsman, then you can easily change your build for another typical rogue play style or focus on magic or become a gunner thanks to free-class-changing and no-stat-points system.Disadvantages-Way too easy bosses, most of which have quite mediocre look with extremely unnecessary oversexualization. Most of hostile npc have quite varied design, but then the boss appears to be another gigantic, half naked woman with big tidies.-Excessive nudity, most of outfits, bosses, both hostile and friendly npc are wearing way too revealing and impractical clothes. I don’t mind boobs but cute anime girls with big tidies are ruining immersion of the game’s apocalypse, making it impossible to take the game seriously.-Like it was mentioned before but the visual part of the game itself is also its problem, as the allegedly gritty story and hopeless world are being wrongly depicted in anime styles, which has its common problem - fan service. Code vein failed to combine something gritty and dark with cute anime girls in sexy outfits, swinging sledgehammers bigger than themselves.-Quite inconvenient map that can’t be adjusted. You can’t move the map and adjust the elevation, which makes it difficult to navigate in some areas. -Character creator lack some things like modifying body shape: no sliders for hands, legs and especially breasts; there’s no option to add muscles, abs and etc. Your character can be just a cute teenage girl as a female or just a skinny teenage boy as male. Character creation requires much more diversity when it comes to adjusting body shape. -Poorly made map design in certain locations. Some locations are way too frustrating, grey and monotone, repetitive and far too long. Sometimes during your gameplay, you may feel like the devs were too lazy to use more than very few textures. Overall, the game’s map isn’t that bad, but it’s not as genius as Dark Souls. -Edgy fashion. Despite the game has its own unique aesthetic strongly inspired by God Eater and DMC, I personally find the game’s fashion quite unfitting to its overall lore, cuz fairly neat and tailored, spiky, sexy and yet edgy girlish clothes are a bit out of place in the gritty, ruined, full of despair apocalyptic world. -Allegedly interactive memory cutscenes aren’t interactive at all. You do nothing during the cutscenes, but walking through linear level with depressing music and no less depressing blue lightning. With the time it’s getting more and more boring.			"

Recommended,10.9,"																This is more like NIOH than to Dark Souls. There is an actual story that takes place and is discussed in game.There are cutscenes and memories to go through that discuss what actually happens in the story.The characters are with you in a town and will go alongside you , chat, or you can leave them behind to solo maps/bosses. It is your choice.The game has good art and sound design.The character builder is far better than most of the Souls/Bourne games as you can place items on a person and use an editor to specifically place things on your person. You can change them in-game without a fee or some B.S. You get a lot of freedom to make your character.The Parry system is simple and is based on your armor rather than your weapon, so learning the timings is pretty neat.There are some difficult bosses and normal bosses that don't make you wanna tear your hair out.The game allows for coop, which is persistent for the area until you beat the boss. You get plenty of time to run around ""dungeons"" to level grind for souls if you need to and a sauna to replenish some of your souls when you die. You get the nice addition of being able to choose from a variety of weapons and can imbue them with status effects. This is pretty good as you can have multiple elements of the same weapon. You can buy the item for imbuing by  speaking to your party members or people in ""base"" and give them gifts. They give you a weapon or some special item which helps you out. You can do a lot with this. There are some challenge things in the DLC, which are cool, and reward you in game for completing tasks.  This got a lot of flak as they really were just one level and a bunch of stuff to earn behind a  hard boss. You can put on a maximum of 8 active skills to use, which cost your ICHOR. Your MP/ICHOR bar is increased every map by using specific skills, backstabs, counters, or items. Your profile, like hunter, scout, queen, whatever, have different build stats as well as your armors. This will count towards ICHOR capacity, defenses against damage types, movement speed, and your counter type, etc. This is different than Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and NIOH where every piece of equipment matters in that regard and you stat min/max. This game just levels you up and that scales with your armor/profile. That's about it.  Pretty simple and hands off for you so you can just play your game. You get to make some choices in the game and do specific things that change the outcome/ending. So, it is a choice. I won't spoil that. Each character you take with you can help you out in combat different ways. Buffs, heals when you're dying or k.o.'ed for a revive, etc. It also doesn't feel as empty of a game. Revisit some areas and other people appear. There is a pretty detailed map that are unlocked by mistles and stuff. There is a very ""annor londo"" like place that's nuts. There are ambushes in the game. This is a game where you can take your time and it doesn't have to feel super high octane. The boss fights are , of course, a pace you have to follow and learn the attack patterns of, but that's because they're boss fights. It is expected. The graphics in this game are great. Sound design is nice and weapons/guns don't sound or feel weak.This is called Anime Souls on the internet a lot for a reason. It is over the top. Yup. The lore building in this game is there and told to you as much as it is environmental, a huge step up from Souls where everyone talks to you like they're going to speak in half-riddles or make little sense purposefully . You're playing an anime. You watch people's memories and last moments, whether they are party members or people in the environment who have fallen (and you get their Blood Code). You can skip them too, which is always good. For people who want their meat, they can have it. For the people who skip, they can skip. Everyone's happy. Finally, battle is simple and familiar to people of the genre. Blocking doesn't always fully block all damage. Dodging is big. Perfect Dodging gives you a bar which fills up being in ""focus mode"", which allows you to strike back harder. This game is fully playable mouse+keyboard or controller. I've done both. Lock on is easy to use, as the genre does. Most weapons are viable. There are some end-game builds that are just ""the best"", which is designed to really help you for NG+ and bosses, among my favorites are HADES and QUEEN. So, grab a friend, slash, shoot, and drain the blood of people. Also, there is a world out there, which you see some part of, but.....  :) Waiting for Code Vein 2 8/10 Will  Play Again.Since Wo Long is busted whenever I try to play online, when I get invaded, etc, it really sucks to play online, which is part of the charm. This game actually works and runs fantastic... AND runs in multiplayer well. Plus, no invasions. :)			"
Recommended,20.6,"																Man, this game... sure is strange. First of all, it's a Souls-like. Good one at that. But there is SO MUCH wasted potential, it's almost sad, to be honest. Anyway, let's break it down, shall we?GameplayThis game, as I said already, is a Souls-like. Plays like Dark Souls 3, if not a bit faster. Enemies, especially bosses are BRUTAL. They are fast, hit very hard, sometimes plain annoying to deal with. Which is fine, but... the local ""Estus flask"" is way too slow to use. Until some of the recent updates you couldn't even cancel the heal animation. I can't count how much I died while healing, because bosses are so damn fast and spammy. I do understand why it's like that though. The game is clearly optimized for Co-Op experience, whether it's real player or AI. And that's a shame, because the game unnecessarily harder without it. I don't like playing with AI. I don't like playing Co-Op in Souls-like games too, first playthrough at least. Why should I be punished for that? Co-Op makes the game way too easy. Solo? Way too harder than it needs to be. Some mechanics are... just... why? For example, there is this sandy area with sand that slows you down. Makes sense, it's a common thing in games. Sand is rough, course, it gets everywhere, but I can tolerate it. In Code Vein, for some reason, it drains your local mana, it's called ""Ichor"". Okay, well, it's fine I guess or so I thought. And then I discovered that almost entire area is filled with this darn sand that sucks your Ichor and calls you a fat-rolling casual. Sure, you can replenish your mana by... using very limited consumable item or slapping your enemies. You can also backstab or parry them for more Ichor too. This entire area is largely unplayable, if you're running mage build of some sort that very much relies on Ichor, because enemies here hit like a tank and have HP of the said tank. Some things are good tho. The entire class system is top-notch and allows you to create many very viable builds, you just need a little bit of time to tinker with it. And maybe a little bit of time to grind some stuff. The game is decently generous in that department, thankfully. I also like that you can switch your class in the middle of an area without any drawbacks. This is the thing that is done right. Story and loreMan oh man, where do I even start with this one...It was very promising from the start. I almost fell for it. But after a couple of hours it's turned into literally an anime with way too much boobs dashing around. Boobs are fine tho, physics included, if you're into that sort of thing. It just felt cliche. I couldn't invest myself in this characters, story or even the world itself. Yes, there were some good moments, but still, not good enough for me. Characters are likable enough to tolerate them at least. Of course all of this is subjective, so... you do you I guess. Lore is full of holes. Like, very big holes. Like boobs in this game. That huge. It's clearly evident that developers wanted to imitate the success of Dark Souls, but they just couldn't I guess. Which is... disappointing to say the least. Potential is here tho. Maybe DLC or a sequel\prequel will help. Or maybe not. Graphics and designIt's an anime game. Looks good for an anime I guess. Unreal Engine sure is great. I can't say the same about the enemy design, sadly. Most regular foes look very, VERY bland and uninspired. Recolored and reused assets doesn't help at all. There are WAY TOO MUCH details. Sometimes it's ridiculous. Looks very overloaded and that's a bad thing in my book. Bosses, on the other hand, look good. Mostly. There are some hits and some misses. Also boobs. Yeah, even bosses here regularly have a giant pair of boobs. It's... good.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The world is a hit or miss too. Some areas are great, for example: snowy location. Some areas are questionable, for example: some certain cathedral. Some are plain bad and lazy, like this certain crypt with ton of reused assets. You'll know when you'll see it. I won't say anything about the character creator, you can read about it in dozens of other reviews. It's very good and there is a boobs slider. That's all you need to know, really. You will spend a hour or so. That's just the way it is.MusicMusic is fine. I do like unique boss themes. Regular combat music is kinda boring, but it's fine. There is one thing I don't understand. So, there is a cutscene introducing the boss. Looks hype and all that jazz. Music is rocking, smooth transition to gameplay... default boss theme plays. Why would you do that? It should count as a crime. I'm dead serious right now. Co-OpI don't have very much to say about the co-op. I played it with my gf and it was fun when it worked. It's kinda glitchy and netcode just sucks ass. Maybe it was an issue from our end, but I've seen many negative stuff about it online. I even somehow died and got resurrected while the game froze. Became invincible and couldn't damage the boss with my pointy stick. For some reason I could damage it with magic. That was fun. In the end, despite all of its flaws, it's a nice game and I do recommend to play it, just don't expect much from it.			"

Recommended,4.7,"																Pros: - Focused art direction makes the maps feel crisp and distinct.- Combat feels tight- Ability mixed with typical ARPG elements feels great- Weapon mix is great, providing very distinct gameplay styles for variety- Character builds are flexible allowing for easy experimentation. - Rewarding and challengingCons:-Limited enemy types- Some recycled bosses- Story is forgettableAll things considered the game was enjoyable mechanically, and kept me hooked for my 33 hours. The story is truly forgettable, but that didn't keep me from just having fun smashing baddies and trying out different builds. I recommend picking this game up. I'm not too sure about the dlc, but the base game is quite enjoyable!			"
Recommended,63.4,"																To call Code Vein just an anime Dark Souls clone is a disservice to both games, and doesn't credit Code Vein for the things that it does. Still, I'd say it's only above average.Story and Characters:Code Vein has a pretty decent amount of ways for you to design the protagonist, and an array of supporting cast characters that all look unique and different, but that's where all the praise for this section goes. I do not feel that this game's characters or story are worth writing about. Even for a Japanese anime game, Code Vein has a convoluted story-line with main characters that all just so happen to be involved with the main plot. The story really just exists to somehow link each area with each other, and the story really just couldn't keep my attention.Exploration and Level Design:I think Code Vein's gameplay save it from its story, but it still has flaws. Exploration is important to any sort of game mimicking Dark Souls, and I think it's done pretty well here. Each area has a decent amount of paths, littered with upgrades, items, map fillers, or simply the way forward. I was engaged battling my way through Code Vein, as it took me from ruined cities to claustrophobic corridors. The one gripe I do have with the Code Vein is its over reliance on verticality - you'll learn to look down at dead ends eventually, but until you realize you must, you'll end up backtracking paths to find a path towards your goal, if you're anything like me.Combat and Classes:Instead of a stat allocation system as seen in Dark Souls, you simply invest your currency into your level, and your stats are determined by your equipment and, more importantly, the blood code, or 'class', you equip. Every class allocates stats slightly differently, and comes with a few different active and passive skills per class. The combat itself is nothing to write home about - typical stamina based dodging and attacking, but the weaving in of class building and skill sets make it a little bit more interesting.While Code Vein doesn't compare favorably to Dark Souls, it still comes off as a very enjoyable, but flawed, take on the genre.

Recommended,25.2,"																Honestly the game was fun at first but then you realize the pattern of these maps and drops making it very repetitive it becomes a chore.Character customization is great I was pretty overwhelmed and glad they did all that but the issues is the map design oh man when you get to the cathedral this can be a stopping point for many people it becomes one long maze finding keys then you realize other maps does the same thing over and over but not as bad as this map.I never felt much Impact using the weapons on this game everything felt like air and weapon variety seriously lacking so i stuck with sword the whole game also that the last 2 maps i was able to just run past through everything and get to the last boss I just got fed up at the game at this point but i did finish it.This game replay value is there but i never will replay this game again with those hellish map decisions they made.The game wasn't too hard and it felt clunky and some of the animations of the enemies is sometimes difficult to deal with because how not smooth the animation is.It tries so hard to be dark souls but fails in a lot of areas.I can't really recommend this game .			"
Recommended,13.6,"																Look... I'm a man of culture myself... but I have a hard time taking this game seriously. The plot is insanely dumb and shallow... and the fan service is out of control. I just watched a scene where it's all sad and ♥♥♥♥ because a child died... and then literally 5 seconds later, a scantily clad boss monster shows up with huge tits and a thong, starts pole dancing on what is basically the child's grave, and then we immediately start fighting. I'll admit, I laughed my ass off but like... I can't figure out who this game is for. The gameplay isn't really that amazing either. To make matters worse, every map is a literal maze, they hide the minimap and you have to bumble your way through it until you find the exit, with the extra intention of making you lose course. It's like they designed the maps poorly on purpose and then called it a feature.			"

Recommended,132,"																Code Vein is less Anime Dark Souls and more the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde of the genre, as close to Dark Souls fanfiction as you can get without lawyers getting involved. It brings over the good and adds great twists while also importing the bad and making their own mistakes. It's a hard title to rate. I'd call it a 7/10 overall, as objectively and unbiased as I possibly can but in truth I was a little angry when I finished the terrible last boss and lost interest in any immediate replays even though I enjoyed the ride overall. The highs are very high and the lows are in the center of the planet. Although I recommend this title I strongly urge you to get it on sale. In Melon Farmer you can be an edgy chuuni boy or gal courtesy of an in depth character maker. You enter a post-apocalyptic world where everybody is an edgy anime vampire by necessity, fighting to survive in a world of edgier zombie vampires in the wake of disaster. Vampire Erotica has a strong unique setting and surprisingly enjoyable story. Despite the imminent talent of the female half of the cast the entire game is completely serious. The main story was engaging, I applaud knowing how to start, hold and resolve mysteries. By the second half of the game I was even enjoying the glorious large ham of a main villain. There are multiple endings and each hits pretty hard with narrative payoffs.Orbs Adventures follows Soulsbourne combat closely. What innovates here is that you can swap your code, or class, at will. You equip a code, level the skills to untether them from the code and mix and match. Codes affect your base stats and what weapons/armors you'll lean towards and there's about 20+ codes. There's emphasis on armor choice as it doubles as a weapon, adding Drain to the Light, Heavy and Skills mix. You can charge up a bloody stylistic attack, activate it through back stabs or focus attacks and there are four varieties. This ties into the magic system where hitting enemies restores mana, draining restores more and expands how much you can hold and lets you weave magic into any build. With five weapon types and many unique move sets you can layer buffs, nukes or zwee dashes into a build(4 passives, 8 actives) for loads of customization.For the most part the enemies get the job done. A lot of the boss fights are entertaining and tightly knit duels, exploration has the trademark atmosphere of danger where every individual enemy can destroy an unwitting adventurer, there's a reasonable variety of monsters to combat, at least at first. As you progress through Path of Bosoms you'll realize that there are ten enemy types at most, if we're being generous. They repeat quickly and by mid game everything is the same. Although they're sound combatants most enemies fall victim to the mechanics of the game. Many stagger from any two hits from any weapon, making them individually harmless if you use a fast one. And you can have a co-op partner at all times, trivializing most stand-up encounters. Of course, most encounters aren't stand-up...By itself Jugs Journeys combat, setting and visually strong graphics would carry it into being a great alternative in the Soulsbourne genre. A modern setting and cyberpunk body horror enemies help set it apart but things falter quickly. The levels may look technically good but after going through a few you realize there are only three tile sets in the entire game: ruined city, cliff/cave and Anor Londo. The early levels actually offer the most exploration at first, including a choice of two areas/bosses to investigate first, then restricts itself tighter than a bodice to mostly linear design in the same ruined cities and caves, sometimes with snow, sometimes fire and a red filter. To shake it up are two mega-dungeon style areas which I credit for actually being impressive mazes. Unfortunately the first is one where the assets are repeated ad nauseam. Few landmarks, repeating textures, identical rooms and halls, only one proper way forward mixed in among branching paths. Later crimes include environmental traps you learn about by falling through them the first time and what I can only describe as the level designer giving up and recycling Anime Londo assets again in a merciful but lazy straight line level including locked doors with their linked switches placed in front of them instead of anywhere meaningful, like guarding your front door by hanging the key on the knob. There's an entire optional dungeon section of regurgitated cave-cities that lets you fight enemies with poorer placement than usual. I'm not a big fan of The Depths.Ah, but loads of games have plain levels. Isn't the combat grand? Usually. But tied into the level design is the encounter design and by God, do the lads at Bandai Namco love one thing more than girlie globes. Ambushes. This game is absolutely riddled with enemy ambushes. Nothing gets the map designers more aroused than the idea of an enemy getting in a cheap shot. Enemies hidden behind corners, around debris and props, activated by item pick ups, shooting at you from raised walkways, teleporting in behind you as you pick up an item in a dead end hallway, falling from the ceiling en masse, sometimes hidden from sight in case you did look up. Enemies that are activated by other enemies noticing you, though some are tied to raising an alarm and you can interrupt that. But many aren't and you just have to grin and bear it. Many, many, many times in this game will something appear outside of your camera and hit you.The polish is lacking. The fine-tuning isn't tuned to begin with. You will get sick of rolling through an enemy thrust attack to be hit by the hit box of the halberd haft uh, moving away from you. Big enemies and bosses have huge area of effect attacks that cover the current city block. Your character is able to move quickly and do loads of fast anime slashes, dashes and jumps so of course all your serious enemies have to be fast too. There are enemies with .5 second wind-ups for 100-foot-in-.5-seconds dashes that will deal 40-60% of your health every time. Many react to healing by using their fastest, lowest wind up distance closer. It's more practical in many cases to just die so your partner will revive you. All of this is compounded by invasions, where waves of enemies will teleport in to rush and charge attack you, helpfully overlapping their attacks and hit boxes so that you can really feel it, Mr Krabs. Mammaries Mission is so faithful to imitating Dark Souls it copied the worst parts of DS 2 without hesitation. Some of the bosses are obnoxious to the extreme for all these same reasons. The Depths features hands down the worst of this, doubling up on enemies that are criminally bad solo. When this game is bad it is really bad.I don't want to gripe that ""game hard, game bad."" I feel that truthfully a lot of it is a matter of testing that might have slipped by. Many enemies could be flipped to good by adding a handful of frames to their attacks. The game was delayed after all and it makes me guffaw to imagine what almost shipped by the first deadline. I did enjoy it enough to complete it, there are many bosses I'm happy to fight, the last five bosses of the game were good, my favorite, good, good and terrible respectively. Overall Code Vein is a good game and we've all got different tastes, for some of you it may be your favorite game. Some will not have the endurance I did and rightfully drop it at the first wall of tedium.TL;DR: Get it on sale, it is a long game and the quality improves as you get further in due to letting your character customize further and become more efficient, so it can take awhile to feel it out. A shaky 7/10 for me, it may fare better for you. Do not get the DLC at full price and do not consider it unless you fall in love with CV and have cleared about 85% of it, the maps are in the penultimate dungeon. Mido best boy.			"
Recommended,13.4,"																I really enjoyed playing this game all the way through.I've played all the souls games but haven't finished one... I'm not THAT intimidated by the difficulty but I usually get distracted, play something else and have a hard time getting back into them. I feel like CODE VEIN did an excellent job at making it just different enough to keep my attention.I feel like this game doesn't deserve just being compared to the Souls series. I see a lot of people complaining about things in CODE VEIN that aren't even fundamentally bad; Just different from the Souls game. I don't think there's anything wrong with that!I love the modern anime style mixed in with grittier environments and enemies, the right dose of ""edginess"" without bordering cringe.I love that for a gameplay-focused game, there actually is a story and it's interesting. While the characters are not incredibly deep, you do get a lot of insight and backstory on each of them.I love how many ""classes"" and ""skills"" the game throws at you. You never stop learning new tricks and wanting to try new things. I've gotten to try a bit of everything in the game and switch things up throughout the game without having to start a new character each time.The environments are sometimes cool and unique and sometimes a little bland or very similar to things you've already seen. I was nevertheless surprised by the amount of different zones; I always expected to be close to the end and the game just kept going.I haven't played much multiplayer... I feel like it could have been done better. It's basically limited to distress signals and I usually can't find anyone to play with. If you die, you're kicked out immediately. I wish I could play co-op a little more casually.I re-played through the game a few times and started a higher difficulty new game + and am starting to lose interest. To be fair, I'm about 60 hours in and feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth. I should probably go back to the Souls series instead! If you're thing is playing the same stuff for hundreds of hours on end however... Maybe this isn't the right game for you?As a one-off, slightly more accessible anime-style Souls-like game however... I can't recommend it enough!			"
Recommended,15,"																I overall have quite enjoyed this game! Here are a few thoughts on it, presented in no particular order:++ Positives ++• Character customization is pretty solid. I would've liked a bit more variety in base outfits, but thankfully the game is pretty easy to mod, which helps. There is a lot of accessory variety and fine-grain customization for those as well as fairly solid general appearance options.• There is a lot of support for a wide variety of playstyles, and a lot of mechanical character customization is also available, including a wide variety of weapons.• I personally enjoyed both the main story and the setting, finding both interesting.• While there will likely be mixed feelings about the companion system, I personally enjoyed it. The companions that can join you also have a nice variety of mechanical styles and personalities.-- Negatives --• The stats are extremely confusing. I highly recommend looking up a guide so that you can understand them. (Why everything uses a letter grading system is beyond me, and leads to unnecessary confusion.)• Almost every boss has a near instant activation, high damage charging attack. This gets very tiresome.• The level design in the game is overall fairly weak. There are too many mazes, composed of narrow, twisting corridors and cliff edges. So, while the visuals are distinct and vary a good bit, too many fights end up taking place in tight hallways.Final thoughts:I didn't try out the multiplayer, since I'm not interested in that, so I have no thoughts on it. I do like the Depths idea, but I also feel it could've been a bit more variant. I'd absolutely love to see another, similar game from this studio, hopefully with better level design. (To be clear, I overall didn't hate the level design, but it is a weaker part of the game.)			"

Recommended,38.2,"																I've played and beaten all 3 Dark Souls games, saw Code Vein for pretty cheap and decided to give it a try.Well, you know those budget JRPG's where you go through the same copypasted hallways and fight the same 5 reskinned enemies the whole game? Code Vein is a lot like that, just with slightly better graphics (thanks to UE4) and somewhat Dark Souls-y gameplay. You just know they banked on the fanservice and half-as­sed everything else.The story is bad and has a lot of those incredibly annoying ""walk slowly while we read the script out loud to you"" dream scenes, but thankfully all of them can be skipped with a single button press. It'd be even better if you could fast forward through them, but no, can only skip them entirely if you don't want to do the walk of shame. Regardless, the story is not really worth your time, it's just your typical shounen anime stuff, power of friendship, muh nakama etc.The combat is weightless and just... serviceable, I guess? You have all those silly anime weapons that look like miniature spaceships on a stick instead of swords and halberds, but the characters swing them like they're made out of foam. Enemies rarely flinch when hit, so you either kill them outright or roll when they swing and then keep poking them with your foam greatsword.There's only 1 equipment slot (chest piece), no rings or accessories of any kind. No shields or offhand weapons. Although you can switch between 2 equipped weapons. Can't distribute stat points manually, it's all automatic. Predictably, this heavily limits build possibilities. You just unlock all the skills and use what's the most efficient at the time.Oh and a lot of mechanics seem to be inspired by Dragon's Dogma, but often it's the bad ones. Like, you need to play as various classes you don't care for just to grind out their skills before switching back to the build you actually want to play. There are NPC companions and just like pawns they won't ever stop making their Captain Obvious remarks. Come across an area with knee deep water? Prepare to hear ""we're bogged down here"" at least 50 times.It's just all so lazy.			"

Recommended,36.3,"																To review this game it is going to be compared to the great Dark Souls.Code Vein is a good game that could have been great similar to Dark Souls.The devs put more story into Code Vein and although it is your typical ""anime"" story it was serviceable.And at the end was left with more questions than answers.Still the story was only a vehicle for the game.I enjoyed the game and my travels in each part of the broken world to explore and fight.I dreaded the big circles dooming up on my map since that means that a boss is about to begin and my stress levels would go up.Luckily Code Vein gives you a companion ( which you can turn off, if you like being more hardcore) and with my friend I managed to take down most bosses easily enough.For the few bosses where it does get a bit too heated, you can always signal for a real person to come to assist you so now there are 3 of you vs the boss.The one part I really disliked and I mean DISLIKED about this game was the healing. The healing animation takes so long that most often than not I would end up healing for X amount but getting hit for Y amount because now the long animation that is playing disables me to dodge roll.Also I got slightly annoyed with the map design of some areas, being very confusing or narrow with no ledges and I end up being kicked off the map to my death...These 2 things make me say that Code Vein is a good game but it could have been great.Still I had my fun and don't regret playing it.			"
Recommended,77.5,"																Code:Vein is one of many games in the last couple of years that have taken a stab at experimenting with the souls-like formula that many “git gud” gamers have come to enjoy like a rake in the face. But does it deserve to stand among the great titans?Code:Vein is a souls-like with a hefty Anime paint-job down to the obsessive character creation where every single detail can be fine-tuned where a ton of people have made it their life’s mission to recreate as many fictional – and perhaps real life – characters as the engine will allow. Of course they’re not perfect recreations, but some of them come pretty darn close. So, yeah, if you’re into creating a character down to their nostril hairs you can definitely do that. You might be there for a couple of hours, though.The story is likewise littered with Anime-tropes and overcomplicated ideas (never mind the abundance of female characters compared to male characters). It’s… bloated to say the least and halfway into the first couple cutscenes I just tuned out and followed the main bits as best I could. You are a revenant, a vampire-like creature that can resurrect itself so long as the heart isn’t destroyed. Much like vampires you need to sustain yourself with blood or otherwise be doomed to frenzy and join the lost; revenants that have discarded their sanity and turned into terrifying creatures that make up the majority of enemies and bosses you end up beating to a pulp. The revenants were created to fight a monster known as the Queen, the first revenant that had incredible powers and wreaked havoc on the living. At some point this Queen was defeated and her body parts scattered and left with several individuals known as successors – People with high compatibility to inherit part of the Queen to then lock themselves away and keep the Queen from resurrecting.As you start the game you find yourself awake in a desolate city, tired and craving blood. You end up getting roped into a small group of revenants looking for blood beads. Red teardrops that help stave off frenzy. When on the hunt for these blood beads the man you were hunting with ends up frenzying and serves as the first boss of the game. From here you’re introduced to the concept of vestiges. Pieces of a person’s memory that you, the player, are able to interact with and integrate into your own body and allow you to use that person’s ability; or blood code.It’s from here you join a group of people that want to find out what’s been happening to the world and what the reason is behind the blood beads and the blood springs that have cropped up over the world. Of course beating difficult bosses and gaining strength and abilities on the way.Code:Vein definitely leans more on the use of special skills rather than skilfully fighting your way through encounters. As I mentioned before, finding vestiges gives you the ability to learn more skills and unlock more classes. These skills range from passive power-ups, buffs/de-buffs and special attacks. Using these active skills takes ichor, the game’s mana pool that can be replenished using items, or attacking/killing enemies. You’re not exactly limited to one class and its skills. If you use a skill for long enough (or spend some money instead) you can master a skill, allowing you to use it with whatever class you see fit. Of course this also depends on what weapon you’re using.Speaking of weapons, the game has several weapon classes that all have their own unique moveset and skills they can be used with. There are two-handed swords, polearms, axes, one-handed swords and… uniquely, bayonets. Rifles that can be used in melee but have an ability to fire “bullets” by using up one ichor for each shot you fire. Other than that the game has a one piece armour known as blood veils. Blood veils are, essentially armour with nothing much in the way of special properties except for parrying which can be a different animation depending on the type.Given that the game is a souls-like, it’s also got its fair share of difficult boss fights and long stretches of small-time enemies that may or may not end up mobbing you to death if you’re not careful. But don’t fret, because Code:Vein doesn’t just have NPCs for chatting, you can even take one with you as a fighting partner. This really is what sets Code:Vein apart from all the other souls-likes, a permanent companion that doesn’t rely on a summoning sign and disappears after their job are done. I mean, they can still die, but I’ve had that happen very rarely. And they can be pretty useful in a pinch. They can resurrect you, have some handy buffs/de-buffs and are capable of fighting anything that moves and not stand around like a lemon.With that said, though, there are a couple of things I believe make Code:Vein a better action-adventure game rather than a souls-like. For one its Anime influences even dragged it into the realm of JRPGs with bosses gaining ridiculous amounts of HP and generally giving me a harder time having to repeat the same pattern for the nth time as opposed to challenging my combat skills. It never felt as though I was studying a boss or enemy to figure out its behaviour, and instead tank the hits until I could beat it into submission by sheer will. The hordes of enemies and their erratic attack patterns made deaths more of a nuisance, like it wasn’t exactly my impatience that did me in and more that I wasn’t given a chance to roll out of the way of a combo attack (sod those martial arts lost in particular).The leveling system is also bare bones at best. You don’t really dump points into stats, instead use your points to level up which gives you a general increase across the board. So no toothpick ninjas or drunken boxers, just run-of-the-mill fighters that use special attacks to whittle down a boss’s health.Overall I enjoyed Code:Vein, I just wouldn’t really recommend it to a veteran Souls player if they’re not prepared to face some of the more obtuse Anime elements and the lacklustre levelling system. Still, the character creation is absolutely amazing and the combat is functional enough where it doesn’t feel like a slog.			"

Recommended,47.5,"																This game is indeed anime dark souls. Unfortunately,  this game only has three elements that could potentially set it apart from its mediocrity as a souls-like clone. The first element would be the character customisation, with quite an in depth character creator, it is easy to create any of your favourite anime characters and play the game as them. My only complaint would be that there is not a convenient way to import and export your character presets to share with others and play as other presets easily. The only way for you to create characters others have made is to meticulously copy the same settings when attempting to remake the same character. The second element is the character customisation of the builds. As the player progresses through the game, you unlock classes which have their own unique stat spreads and passive and active gifts (the games term for spells). The gifts are initially restricted to the specific class to use, but you can ""master"" the gifts through killing enemies and this unlocks the class restriction on the spells, allowing you to use the mastered gifts on all other classes (outside of a few powerful gifts which are locked to a class no matter what). While some weapons, gifts and armour have a stat restriction, since the stat spreads are tied to the classes, you can just freely swap classes on the fly for no cost meet the stat requirements.  You basically have access to all the builds and can freely switch from one build to another once you have unlocked the required classes and the relevant gifts you want to use. The weapon system is simple as the weapons can be enhanced to +10 with in-game materials, I found that the game gave you enough of the enhancement materials so it would not be a problem if you wanted to try a bunch of weapons. Additionally, in the later areas, when finding new armours and weapons, they come upgraded to the expected baseline(+3,+6 or +9) of your current weapon/armour set so you don't need to enhance them from +1 to +10. The last element that is quite important to this genre that the game does deliver on is thankfully the bosses. While the graphics of the game is a bit lacking for the overall experience, the gameplay of the bosses is quite superb for the most part. Outside of a couple outliers, the bosses are all quite fair and challenging as a solo experience. While most of the bosses movesets and attacks start out basic, usually they have a soft phase change halfway through the fight. The base moveset is built upon with small and simple additions that add to a fair but still challenging boss encounter. There are a couple of moves that lack a react-able tell for some bosses, but this is rare enough that was not a source of frustration when learning bosses. Unlike the general enemies, the bosses had minimal reuse outside of one remixed fight. I do know that the depths area just reuse these bosses, but that area seems more like a bonus option side area for you to grind in. When coupled with the build variety and freedom to switch to any build on the fly, learning a boss has never had more options available especially when a boss is giving your specific build a hard time. Unfortunately, outside of these 3 factors, everything else in the game is either painfully average or subpar compared to the Fromsoft games. However, as flawed and subpar as this game is, overall, I still had an enjoyable time as the game was what I expected for the most part for a game that seems like Dark souls with an anime aesthetic. Would recommend this game on a heavy sale for anyone who enjoys Souls-likes, the anime aesthetic and the excellent boss gameplay of the genre.			"
Recommended,94.9,"																Code Vein is an amazing game and is quickly becoming one of my favorites ""souls-like"" game.The game is not without issues, but even then the game is really entertaining.The character creation is great, and you can modify everything except your face and gender just by interacting with a mirror at the base. I really liked that and ended spending time changing accessories between two bosses to try new things.During exploration you are constantly accompanied by another character (you can choose which one and you unlock more as you go, also you can just choose to go in alone passed the tutorial boss), The main concern of many was that it would make the game easier.It does, but it's perfect this way, Code vein is not Dark Souls, or Nioh or anything else, and it doesn't need to be. Companions are really helpful but they can still die pretty easily, and even then the whole level design is made to be challenging even with someone helping you. Bosses are hard so far, and there's some enemies that can gang up on you if you're not careful. I'm something like 8 hours into the game, and I died a few times, way more than in other games like Sekiro or Nioh.Overall the game is not more difficult, but ""difficult differently"". The whole feel of the game is different too, you may have noticed that recently souls like are more ""nervous"" , ""quick"" or stuff like that. Code Vein is not, the game is slow and you have to think carefully before attacking, a bit like the first dark souls but ""modernized"".And I must admit that's what I liked about the game, enemies are quicker than you are, especially if you play with the heavier weapons like I do. It gives more weight to each fight and I definitively thinks it's one of the game bigger strength.Each weapon plays differently and there's enough diversity to use really different combos with the same weapon also every type of weapon seems to have variants with different movesets and different stats requirement and scaling.I heard a lot of people complaining about the impacts, I personally was expecting something bad like in the god eater games but I find it quite good (especially with the hammer). The story seems quite alright, like a generic anime that's well executed. (if you liked the one in god eater 3 you'll like this one)The musics are great.I still haven't finished the game, but if there's one thing I'm sure of it's that I really like it so far.I thought it was going to be meh, I read some really bad reviews on the net, and I was in a bad mood when I started playing it.Even in these conditions, this game was able to change my mind in only a few minutes. And while I can't say that you'll like it I can't recommend enough that you give this game a chance.Edit: Game crashed in the last area of the game, I lost over 4 hours of progress and I have to redo a few bosses and areas.... Looks like I won't finish this game after all....			"
Recommended,125.9,"																“Anime of Dark Souls” that’s probably what you are going to hear the most when talking about Code Vein. While not wrong I still think this game does a lot of different things that makes it stand out on its own.Code Vein it’s an anime styled post apocalyptic action rpg , the world is being attacked by these mysterious monsters and it’s up to you to figure out what’s going on, nothing really groundbreaking or anything. I still enjoyed the story for what it was and the lore behind each character. For me the most interesting aspect of this game was the combat and character building that the game has to offer, the combat has a lot of inspiration from dark souls, you have your light and heavy attack, a roll all dependent on your stamina bar.The biggest difference stands from the character building , rather than decide what you build you start with, this game allows you to change anytime from different styles or as they call bloodcodes, each bloodcode provide a different set of skills and buffs to your character making easier to adapt for different types of situations.Now the biggest question, who is this game for? I think dark souls purists might not find this game appealing for it’s more “loose” nature of the combat and the less refined level design, but i think if you look at this game as an action rpg you will have a good time with it!

Recommended,32.5,"																So it's kind of hard to not recommend this game. If you're into creating characters you'll love this game. If you're into in depth combat and learning how to properly fight something, then you might be a little frustrated. The combat is fun and its mildly difficult. IMO the difficulty is exaggerated. However, the reason I give it a negative review is the game is sloppy. A triple A studio pushed this out and while it works and plays well the combat mechanics are just sloppy enough to render lots of things tedious. The backstab mechanic is finnicky, the parry has an odd timing and the dodge roll is tempermental. None of these things are game breaking but they're all off JUST ENOUGH to make a lot of fights tedious. Now if you want a good story I suggest you keep walking, cause this one is meh at best. Overall its fun, but please don't spend 60 dollars on this. Buy it when its on sale.			"

This truly shames me to admit because she is now one of my favorite characters in the game.			"
Recommended,17.3,"																If you like Soulsborne and Soul-Eater, this is the kind of game for you. Although I wouldn't say it is like Soulsborne games as only some mechanics are souls-like eg. Bonfire/Mistle, combat(rolling/quickstepping), Souls/Haze as currency, Souls/Haze drop after you died, the rest are more like God-Eater.Spent around 36 hours for my first playthrough, doing a 100% run with True Ending. Some interesting mechanics that I love is the Ichor, which is like your mana/fp, you don't regen them unless you attack with your weapon or perform drain attack/backstab. The game is quite hard in terms of survivability, since you don't regen hp and Ichor naturally, there are of course some hp regen passive but they're quite late in the game and not that worth it as well. Not to mention, you also don't have a real 'shield', you can only block with your weapons.As for story, the main story is great, but not that awesome. But, I'd suggest you to collect every vestige in the game and restore all their memories, their stories are really really good. I enjoy the memories story more than the main story tbh, especially Cruz & Louis, Yakumo & his friends, and Mia & Carmilla. Also, the OST in the game are really awesome, I like the OST more than anything else.You can freely customize your character, that's a super plus. Tons of options for you, and you can literally spend hours for character customization to make your favourite character. There are also tons of Blood Code to choose from, which will decide what kind of playstyle your character gonna be. Each Blood Code has different stats and different skills as well, but you can master them and you can access them even when you're using other Blood Code. For leveling, you just simply level you character, there's no point allocation for stat, you stat scales with your Blood Code and Blood Veil/Armor.For weapons, there aren't many categories, you only have longsword, greatsword, spear, halberd, polearm, hammer, and rifle. I play the whole game with gifts build, basically elemental sorcerer build with bayonet, I really love the bayonet in the game because of its versatility. Quite hard to play because you will need to manage your Ichor and constantly refill them as well, but at the same time the spells also hit like a truck in the late game with proper build. If you're planning to go for some easy playthough then I'd suggest using two-handed weapons, they like really hard, very good stagger, and can melt anything in the game.Companion/Partner wise, it's up to your playstyle, but I'd suggest you pick a partner that can support you well, pick melee if you're doing range build; pick range if you're doing melee, or rock both melee setup; and there's a support/healer partner as well. But I will just say one thing, YAKUMO is the best companion after all the testing. High damage, have protection barrier, tanky, and he's a pretty chill guy to hang out with. You can also revive your fallen ally with a default spell at the cost of your % hp, make sure to bring it if you're doing co-op for revival.I wouldn't say this is a Dark Souls like game, because its not. If you really want to experience some Souls-like style consider playing The Surge 2. Still, this is a very great game if you like that kind of genre, and I'm having a really great time playing it. I still have 2 more ending to get, and probably spend some time doing co-op just to get the lv30 achievement and make more character designs as well. I rate it 8.5/10.			"

Seeing the hardest character in the game on the edge of tears purely by the quivering of his eyes is excellent attention to detail. Some character arcs fall flat, but those are the minority.Conclusion: While story is king, the game-play is severely lacking. 6/10, wait for a sale.			"
Recommended,18.1,"																Fantastic game. Very in-depth combat possibilities. A lot of worthwhile exploring. Gorgeous locations and character designs are on point in my personal opinion. I have not run into too many games that have made me feel so invested in the characters around me and the world itself. I have played so many hours of this game and I am not done yet. Do not even get me started on how insane the character creator can be. Pros -*Character Creator is ridiculously good.*You can change your character's appearance even after creating them and half way into the game.*Weapons have a very enjoyable feel to them when you land hits, and have different play-styles. *Weapons among their own type even have differences too.*Tons and tons of Blood Codes(Classes) to learn new abilities and create your own personal class of your choice with.*Gifts(Skills/Abilities) feel almost endless sometimes as you play the game. So many to try out and combine with others and change your play-syle with.*NPCs are fantastic and very lovable. You do not get tired of them and their reasons for what they do within this world.*You can take different NPCs with you to these locations whenever you feel like it. Personal favorite is Mia.*Each location you go to to explore is MASSIVE. There is so much to do in these places and so much to discover(secrets and lore) that it can take a while to complete the map. Take breaks every now and then.*Tons of well-crafted cut scenes to watch and enjoy. *So many screenshot worthy moments with or without your character in the cutscenes.*Very appealing story that made me want to keep going and learn more about the mysteries of the world & the characters.*This is not a kid game where no one dies.*Veils(Drain weapons)- Stinger, Claw, Spikes, and Hounds(might not all be the correct names). These weapons provide a lot of options for combat in tandem with your Abilities and your normal weapons. My favorite has to be the Stinger. *Battles are very enjoyable and rewarding. Boss battles are so fun and intense. Love them so much.*Graphics are gorgeous as a whole. You never get a dull moment in regards to how things look around you, or the people.*Not just a ""pretty game to look at"", look at what was stated above to understand what I mean.*3 Endings that are definitely worth your time to acquire. You have choices to make that will decide the fate of your world.*Bosses are very beautiful as well, not only tough.*So many things to do outside of the main story by the way. Side Missions, conversations with NPCs, finding hidden items and events after completing a previous location, updates on NPCs thoughts and behavior, hot springs to learn more about what you have gone through so far, The Abyss with it's insane boss fights, etc.*Worth the 60$, you can get easily over 60 or 75 hours worth of entertainment and play. There are so many things to do in this game. Ignore the morons saying it is not worth it.Cons - *Veils(Drain weapon), Gifts(Abilities/Skills), Blood Codes(Classes)Weapons can definitely confuse a new player. But, nowhere near as complicated as some fools think it is. You just have to give it some actual thought and not rush through it and skim over everything. It is really easy once you understand it.*Cathedral can be really annoying if you die and forget where you were as you discovered the location and progressed. I was basically done with the area, but died once and I forgot where I was when i died and where to go so i kept going back to previous areas thinking I must have missed something to open up a new area when in fact I was supposed to go this other way. I know others have complained about this specific place, but it is honestly not a big deal and they are blowing it up to proportion. Using markers also help.*I cannot remember what else.			"
Recommended,4.4,"																So, you're probably wondering why there's a big fat thumbs down button on the top of my review here.To be fair it doesn't deserve a big fat thumbs down, what steam needs is a thumb in the middle. cause that wold perfectly describe CODE VEIN as well. Mediocre.But why?To be honest CODE VEIN starts off pretty well, The combat is decent and the worldbuilding seems interesting, but after a few area's the game quickly starts losing that charm. The main reason this happens is the lack of variety.  A lot of the levels give off the same vibe and don't look that diffrent from eachother. it's mostly just a destroyed city again but this time it's on fire or it's covered in sand. and it's like that for basically the whole game with a few exceptions. For example each time i travelled to a new area in a dark souls game i was looking forward to how  it would look and feel. after the first 3 area's i just couldn't get that feeling for this game. now area's aren't the only variety problem in the game. Enemy variety is also very weak. most of the enemies get recycled every few area's and that coupled with the samey area's just makes for an unnapealing boring world to be in. The game also just misses that bit of polish you want in a game like this. some bosses have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instakill moves with zero to none foreshadowing wich can make some fight very frustrating in the wrong way. Honestly the game isn't complete trash it's just not amazing either. It can provide a decent amount of fun if you can overlook some of the bs happening in the game but don't expect polish or level design on the level of dark souls gamesPro's- Fun combat- Great character creation- Online works better then most souls gamesCon's- No enemy variety- Level variety is weak at best- Feels very unpolished in some area'sIf you can get it on sale and you like soulslikes sure give it a try.At full price you's be better off spending your money elsewhere.

Recommended,74.9,"																Code VEIN is what you get when you take a souls-like formula and inject it with so much anime that it feels like you are watching one. This game is a very good souls-like and while it may not particularly challenging save for no partners, the game is absolutely gorgeous, the enemies, enviornments, and the weapons all have that souls appeal and charm to them whilst being original to the formula. A big thing about this game that's also amazing in terms of quality is the character creator, never have I seen a more fun and complex creator ever in the history of me playing games. The partners AI is...debatable from being either really good or npc in a GTA game that gets molly-whopped. But all of that is well and good because you shouldn't rely on them so much anyways. The story in this game is pretty good too, not the best I've heard but a pretty good one all things considered.The only complaint I have and that might stop people from playing is the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, that area is not only massive, but the enemies in there are not the greatest to say the least all of them (except the common bad guy or the large enemy) know how to teleport onto your position, this isn't particularly a new concept but when you run through and several enemies start teleporting onto you and deal immediate damage, to new players this may come off as annoying and frustrating. I personally know people who dropped the game at this exact point because of the enemies. So be wary about the Cathedral.Fantastic souls-like. Highly recommend to anyone who is new to the genre as well. 8.5/10			"
Recommended,28.5,"																Code Vein is a Darksouls clone  mixed with Godeater and set in a destroyed city esk setting with hints of the Nintendo Formula thrown in just for added Japanese flavor. All and all a fun experience, although alot of the areas felt simple and short, short enough to be ran through in under two minutes once you navigate the maze design. The Gameplay: Plays alot like a easier dark souls one but instead of magic you have equitable skills that  range from melee move sets to magic and buffs; Of which are modified by a in game class system that changes your stats. The game can feel rather easy at times due to the AI Partner system that can often hold its own against anything short of a boss, however I wouldn't go into the game expecting an actual Dark Souls Experience as alot of the bosses  never felt very challenging  and in the late game had little to no trouble with them due to their often forgiving moveset.The Story: You play as a Generic Anime Mcguffin hero with Amnesia after the events of a world ending event with the ability to relive the memories of others through their blood.  My main problem is that throughout the story I often felt like the player character was playing more of a assistant role to the side characters and that the story had no idea where it was going up until the ending. Code Veins story probably would have done better as an anime as such, but was still incredibly interesting for the parts actually related to the player character. i'd give the game a 7/10. Its fun enough as a game, a tad short and the story could have been an 8 or 9 easy, but its good for what it is.			"

Recommended,28.5,"																My recommendation of ""Yes"" comes with the strict caveat that you're playing this game for fun and fooling around, and not for a quality gameplay experience. Sadly as someone who willingly subjects themselves to the entirety of the God Eater series, I did not want to miss out on this latest me-too from the developers that could only dream of riding Monster Hunter's coattails and are now, of all things, attempting to apply their formula to the Dark Souls category. Once again all the familiar post-apocalyptic story tropes from GE are present here as well, including their uninspired takes on slavery, sacrifice, and survival, all robbed of their drama by largely taking place off-screen.If you play this game, remember that it's by the same devs behind God Eater, and all that entails for how jank, uneven, and unforgiving the gameplay will be for the sake of development expediency and ""anime style"". For a game that pulls you so close into the action, the controls lack a lot of nuance, demand high commitment, and are extremely punishing in a very unrewarding, unintuitive, and uneducational manner. It's a fun romp with a friend, especially if you're a sucker for anime stories and characters, but the chore of grinding Awakes and unlocking Codes is a heartless one for how little is on the line and how little reward you receive for wagering it. The levels are linear in their structure, predictable in their malice, and lacking in their spectacle. This may make for an interesting challenge for hardcore players who want to wrangle an uncooperative camera and dishonest hitboxes, but it's largely an exercise in masochism.As a cherry on top of a pile of chocolate ice cream, Shift continues to disappoint on another key front as well for four games running: your character's tits cannot be nearly as big as the NPCs'.Don't listen to the Yakumo simps.

Recommended,87.8,"																Imagine NieR: Automata except a Souls-like... and instead of machines and oil, it's the Lost, and blood... lots of blood. That's CODE VEIN. And it's amazing. Short version: if you like Dark Souls, Elden Ring, NieR: Automata, or any such similar game, just grab this and have fun.Long version... coming into this, I didn't know what to expect. I've played hundreds of hours of Elden Ring and NieR: Automata, and I loved them both, so in hindsight it's easy to see that I would love this game. But gameplay aside, it shares a lot of similarities with both games too, such as in the way the narrative is delivered; that is, you learn about the story in bits and pieces, and the characters are very interesting, diverse, and easy to become attached to. Also, like NieR, you have a partner (who you can change at will) who helps make combat more interesting and approachable. And similar to Elden Ring, different abilities, weapons, and gear have an enormous impact on your battles and chance of success. You can choose to be a tough tanky fighter, a sneaky assassin, a long-range ""mage"" caster, and lots of other things, and you can even mix & match to your liking after becoming proficient in different Gifts.If you appreciate a great story, a beautiful world, interesting characters, and most of all a tremendous challenge, play this game. But be patient with yourself! As in any Souls-like, taking your time and thinking things through leads to victory. It's definitely a very rewarding experience!			"

You can mismatch skills between classes🟩 Deep character customization🟩 Mini-map is very helpful🟩 Unlike Dark Souls, saving isn't permanent and can be controlled. Although it can be 'misused' (unlikely to happen for this game), what this means is that you can test out various upgrades/builds/items without fear of losing things permanently🟥 Vestiges have good backstory but it gets tedious to walk slowly walk around them. Needed a better way of presenting them🟥 If you are overleveled, you can't raise gift proficiency. Also, differentiating between maxed and unmaxed gift isn't very intuitive🟥 Weapons are not saved between classes🟥 Comparing to Dark Souls, level & enemy design could've been betterWas really surprised to see a connection with the God Eater universe (made my jaws drop when I saw it, although it lasted for a brief moment).

Not Recommended,10.3,"																Did I have fun playing this? Yes. But was it an experience I could recommend? Not really.Character customization:You're given several options for outfits early on, and notably you can't ""mix and match"" pieces of them. Those are also your only outfits. (There do exist ""blood veils"" that can be found in-game, and they're basically cool cloaks, but... that's really all that they are.)The anime-faces are a ""pick a shape""-type of customization, rather than in any way allowing you to rearrange eyes-mouth-nose-chin.You don't really get control over the color-selection either. Rather, a bunch of ""color options"" are available. There's a LOT of these, but they can definitely be kind of limiting in comparison to a simple color-wheel.There's a bunch of accessories, which is fun, but a lot of them are either variants of the same thing, or have weird clipping-issues.Also, fun anecdote. If you save any kind of appearance in the customization, you can use it in-game once you have access to the mirror. This means that you can cheerfully switch between male and female presets mid-playthrough.Story:You're a vampire-thing wandering around chewing on blood-fruits in a post-apocalyptic city. Then you're recruited to help discover the source of the blood-fruits. In the process, you make friends (?) and learn more about the world and its inhabitants.It's not a particularly complicated story, and it follows the Soulsborne path of having the ending be both obscure (three different endings, and they can get locked-in REALLY early in the game) and not exactly ""cheerful"".Personally, the story had a lot more in-your-face cutscenes than I'd expect from... basically any game this side of the Final Fantasy series, but that's probably a matter of taste.Also included are a bunch of ""quests"" that you can do for people you find out in the world, but those people are even more awkward to find than most Dark Souls NPCs (they only seem to spawn AFTER you've completed the level, and possibly another level after that). They also don't really seem to matter whatsoever for the rest of the game's story.Level-design:As others have pointed out, the level-design is kind of ♥♥♥♥. Not in the sense of ""it's ugly"", because there are very few areas that aren't in some way absolutely stunning.My problem is basically that Code Vein heard about Dark Souls' obsession with swamps, and said ""let's add even more things like that"".We've got a swamp to wade through.We've got sand that slows you down, drains your ichor, and which enemies hide inside of in a way that makes them immune to attacks until they're attacking you.We've got fire-ground that you have to walk over, and which damages you when you do. On top of fire-walls in narrow corridors that will stagger and hurt you if you touch them, with enemies of course lurking on the other side of them.We've got walls that will suddenly attack you if you come close to them, but which can potentially be dodged if you're lucky.At least half of the levels are basically running along cliff-edges with enemies attacking you, and of course they can knock you around to the point where you can easily go flying off the edge if you get hit even vaguely in the vicinity of a drop.And we've got at least two different levels with air-borne corridors that go on for miles, crisscrossing each other into a purely frustrating maze (one of them also randomly has holes in them to fall through, just to be annoying). To the point where, if it weren't for the minimap (which is itself kind of awkward to use), a lot of these levels would be outright unplayable.Bosses:This is one of my main issues with this game.Think Dark Souls bosses, but sped up. Except... because of how they're ""sped up"" they're not the exhilarating fights of Bloodborne, but rather ""this attack doesn't have an amp-up animation and will insta-kill you"".Attacks with AoEs that span half the boss-arena are common.There are very rarely any hints that a boss will use ""that attack"" before it's already hit you. (This includes several AoE-attacks, yes.)You're given a companion who can revive you a few times (if you're lucky), but that's more of a ""we designed the difficulty around this mechanic"", so it really doesn't get better.Several bosses will leap around the area like they're pretending to be a Bloodborne-boss, but since you have a companion (meaning that you can easily dodge into an attack aimed at them) and your dodging is pretty much only on par with Dark Souls, the end result feels very RNG-based.In particular, there's a Dual Boss with opposing elemental weaknesses, where both have AoEs attacks that they're very enthusiastic about using, and if you leave your companion alone for any period of time they're going to die long before you grind away the health of any of them. (For me, this resulted in resorting to fire-protection, switching my weapon to a crush-hammer, leveling about 30-40 times, and then getting extremely lucky.)The fact that they also decided to recreate their own version of the Amygdala-fight didn't exactly endear their designing-skills to me. (What's so bad about making bosses that are FUN to fight, instead of just ones that are impossible to hit and do infinite damage?)This is why I can say that, despite the fun I've had with this game. I can't really recommend it to anyone.(Like, give me enough mod-support that someone can delete AoE-attack-patterns from bosses or something, and I'd be willing to go along with it. But it's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it's less ""challenging"" and more ""rock falls everyone dies""-frustration.)			"

Recommended,112.5,"																It's very good. It's less of a souls-like and more like some kind of God Eater/Bloodborne hybrid. Combat is too fast to be in the same department as dark souls and you have more tools at your disposal than most souls-like games. Fleshing your character out is also drastically different compared to either Bloodborne or Dark Souls. You don't have a very great variety of weapons or armor but you do have Blood Codes which have unlockable skills that can be carried over so you can develop your own sort of class and mesh it with the weapons and blood veils you like. You can also do this while out in the world which makes experimenting with builds a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable.The character creation is fantastic and they don't try to exploit you for wanting to change aspects of your appearance.English voice acting is on a scale fluctuating between really good and really bad, as it does with most games like this.The difficulty (thus far) feels fair and my only legitimate complaint is that some areas are kind of cramped and it can be a little frustrating working the camera while trying to fight. Companions are optional and you can go completely alone as well if that is a point of concern for anyone.TLDR It's not a wannabe Dark Souls. It's about as close to Dark Souls as God Eater is to Monster Hunter. There are some areas where inspiration was drawn but it's too different to even really be considered a souls-like to me. If you recognize this and come in wanting a solid hack and slash title I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

Recommended,30.7,"																This is a flawed but fun take on the Dark Souls series, which features half-naked anime women with absurdly large breasts and ever-so-slightly unrealistic jiggle physics.What you need to bear in mind is that this might look and feel like a Dark Souls game, but you cannot play it like a Dark Souls game. You'll gain ""Blood Codes"" that function more like jobs in a Final Fantasy game, changing your stats and giving you access to different offensive and defensive ""Gifts"". Master a Gift and you can use it with other Codes, and switching between Codes is like completely resetting your build in Dark Souls. The game is designed around you changing your Code, changing your Gifts, and changing your equipment to best suit the bosses.Ah, the bosses. The difficulty level of the areas you explore gradually increases throughout the game, with the layouts becoming more convoluted and challenging to navigate, whereas each boss is accompanied by a difficulty spike almost as enormous as some of the female characters' breasts. You will likely get absolutely destroyed by them on your first, second, and third attempts; they're all fast, aggressive, unpredictable, and can kill you in 2 or 3 hits. Almost every boss has a save point nearby, so it's not like you have to travel far to get back to them, although throwing yourself at them time and time again isn't really going to get you anywhere.Having trouble with a boss that uses poison attacks? Equip armour with high poison resistance, keep an eye out for any Blood Codes with Gifts that protect you from or let you cure poison, and explore the areas to find items to boost your healing ability. That doesn't make the fight easy, just a lot more manageable. I was ready to give up on the final boss until I thought ""Well, if it resists all of those, then why don't I use..."" and I thrashed it on my next attempt. That's just how the game is designed, for better or worse.My one serious issue with the game is how you are punished for over-levelling. As I mentioned before, Gifts can be mastered and used with other Blood Codes. Defeating an enemy earns you Gift experience... unless you're at too high a level in a particular area, in which case you don't earn anything. I stayed at as low a level as possible throughout the game anyway, however I can imagine a situation where a player is struggling with a boss, keeps dumping all their souls-sorry, ""Haze"" into levels to get past it, and then finds that they're stuck with limited move-sets for their Blood Codes, until they move on to an area with a higher level cap. There are items you can use instead to master gifts, but it can be tedious to farm them from enemies.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Souls-like games, as long as you go into it knowing that it's going to be lacking polish and there will be times when you get frustrated by some sloppy design choices. And there are pretty anime ladies with huge boobs, did I mention that already?			"
Recommended,64.8,"																My Score: 9/10PrologueParasite, by definition a being that lives in or inside another organism and takes its food from it without giving anything in return to its host and often even causing damage to the host. This definition includes the Biological Organ Regenerative or to summarize BOR, a parasite that attaches itself to the heart of its host and feeds on the blood, until the day when, due to a threat that humanity had no chance of, it was modified, becoming powers their vampire-like host, these new hosts came to be called Revenants. ^^As soon as the Revenants took over the battlefield the tide turned, as they had power superior to any human and were nearly immortal, but at the cost of regularly needing human blood. Trying to solve this problem, humanity tried again to modify the parasite, through a project known as Queen, but something went terribly wrong, causing a part of the city to be isolated from the world by a wall of giant thorns and a red mist that is deadly to anyone, revenant or human. In this place isolated from the rest of the world and with limited resources, an revenant wakes up from its sleep, not knowing how important it will be to this place. ^^Pros:+ An excellent character creator that allows the player great freedom to customize the character's appearance, thus giving a very unique appearance to the protagonist.+ Very devastated and dark world from cities to mountains but at the same time with lots to explore and interesting companions to help in the mission of trying to bring hope to this world.+ Great use of music and silence to create the atmosphere, both in the moments of struggle and in the quieter moments of exploration.+ Beautiful anime-style graphics, personally I think the graphic style of the characters, clothes and equipment matched a lot with that of the created world.+ Great Japanese voices for the characters, both main and secondary characters.+ Frenetic and fun action with good commands that make the battles fast, while we attack and dodge the attacks of the monsters.+ History of the world and its very interesting universe. Completing with three different ending options.Cons:- Although for me it is not as difficult as other Souslike games, it is still a game of this genre, so expect a good degree of difficulty. I myself don't remember any boss that I didn't die a few times before I managed to defeat them.- DLC dungeons are not interesting and do not impact the game's story. Game mechanicsIn this shattered city where the main revenant of our story wakes up without memory, it is necessary to fight to survive, because human blood is limited and the revenants are thirsty, luckily after the city was sealed, a mysterious white plant appeared that produces a fruit known as blood crystals that work in the same way as human blood, unfortunately many of them are guarded by revenants that have not fed in a long time and have become aggressive monsters that need to be fought with weapons such as swords and axes, in a true Souslike style, collecting the essence of defeated enemies to strengthen yourself. ^^But it's not because it's a gray world and without much hope of a way out of this ruined city that this journey should be lonely. Because throughout the battles and exploration, from ruined cities to snow-covered mountains, we find revenants that want more than just to quench their thirst, in search of some way to improve the world, and with the help of our protagonist, make day to day at least with a little more hope. But little do they know, that they will soon discover much more than what was revealed to the population about the Queen project and more. ^^ Art and soundProduced by BANDAI NAMCO, I must say that the graphics of the game pleased me a lot, managing to pass both in the animations and in the maps a gray world and without much reason to hope while presenting its characters in anime style, with their big eyes, more clothes and well-detailed weapons, combined with a character editor with a good variety of colors, hair styles and everything else, in my opinion having combined very well. As for the soundtrack, another point that I liked a lot, due to the great use of the songs, or in this case the lack of them, because in several moments without battles, we only have the company of the sound of the wind, giving the feeling of emptiness and isolation. , with only the sounds of the creatures and our partner breaking the silence, I even need to quote the great voices of the Japanese version of this work. ^^ ConclusionCODE VEIN was a game that I pre-purchased without much information, and I must say that I don't regret it, because from beginning to end I wanted to explore this world from beginning to end and see all its history, even though I didn't being a big fan of Souslike style games before. It's a game that needs a little patience because the monsters will give the player a good challenge, but I guarantee that all the work will be worth it, especially when reaching the good ending, precisely the most difficult of the three endings, but without any doubt the more rewarding. So this is a work that I really recommend, both for fans of Souslike, and for those looking for a more different story and to become a revenant in this gray world that still has salvation. ^^			"

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died.

Recommended,22.8,"																Lets start with the negative, cause there isnt much:The 3 DLCs are terribly handled and basically just reused bosses. One boss per DLC. For 9,99€ per. Worst DLCs ive ever seen.The game itself can be very complicated to understand with all the Codes you can get and use, which are basically the stats of this game which govern what builds and weapons you can use, and the map layout is sometimes extremly confusing.The tits. I know im mainly alone with this one, but i just dont like oversexualized animes and games. Which almost was a reason for me to not get it... but im glad i did, because luckily thats really just superficial fanservice and not a topic in the game. But yeah, most men would count this as a positive.Ye thats about it, now for the positives:First of all, the best thing about this entire game is the soundtrack. Its one of the best OSTs of any game ever, and i say that as someone who loves From Soft OSTs like Bloodborne, which imo is still the best one ever made, but the one of this game actually comes kinda close, which is ridiculous. Rarely ive cried harder to a song then to ""Memory of the Lost"" or ""Requiem"". But most of the songs arent sad, but upbeat, orchestral and epic. And almost every single one is an absolute banger.Now for the game itself, its all in all just great. The combat isnt Dark Souls level, but closer to it then most souls-likes, its pretty crisp, accurate and fun. Not always ofc, but most times. The weapons are very fun too, there are just enough diffrent ones to have a big enough arsenal to choose from, but not too many to get overwhelmed, and not many same-y ones.The worldbuilding is fantastic. I would not have expected that from this game. Some locations have obvious references to other games (Anor Londo, if you know you know), but thats fine, theyre not copies or anything. And while some maps can look kinda repetetive after a while, youre probably not long enough in one level to notice too much. Its varied enough to not immidiatley jump out.And the story... is a bit complicated at first, and you have to search for it, but its actually so darn good... most animes ive seen dont compare. It gets better and better the deeper you dive into it, i can only recommend watching videos about it too to understand more. Not many games made me actually cry, and the OST didnt help either... to make me stop crying that is.I honestly can say, even if you dont like anime, oversexualized characters, ridiculously big weapons etc., if you like an emotional story, fun combat, great visuals and songs, try it. Especially if you like the God Eater Series, from which this is kind of a spinoff i think? I heard its at least in the same universe.Right now its -80% off for 9,99€, theres no excuse to not get it right now. But yeah, skip the DLCs. c:			"
Recommended,89.3,"																I have played over 50 hours of this game and wanted to just put my thoughts out for anyone else interested in this title. I have been interested in Code Vein since its announcement and have followed it when I could. Once it popped over to the PC and steam I had my chance to play it and I was not let down. The game is incredibly fun, allowing for a lot of customization ranging from the appearance of the playable character to the playstyle that you run. (Seriously I spent like an hour in the character customization) It is basically an Anime Souls-like game, with punishing combat if not careful, though not to the extent to other souls-like games.  If you are attracted to either anime-esque aesthetics and story, or the souls-like combat but with a small twist, then this is something to look into. Despite being a souls-like game in terms of combat, Code Vein does do a few things differently that sets it apart from some other titles: Blood Codes and Gifts (Basically classes and skills) An explicitly told story CompanionsThe game has a feature called Blood Codes, which are basically classes that favor a particular style of play, ranging to being a tanky two-hander weilder, a long range magic user, or a fragile caffine addicted sword user. Blood codes provide the player with an assortment of passive and active skills that can be used while using that blood code. If there is a particular way you want to play, you will most likely find a blood code for that style. And if not, you can make it. The passive/active skills, or gifts as they are called in the game, can be mastered by using them in battle, and once mastered can be used with ANY blood code, with only a few exceptions. There are plenty of builds that people have developed that take these into account, and you can always be creative with how you want to build yours. This encourages players to both explore different options and playstyles and also to build a playstyle that fits for them. Another thing that Code Vein does is actually tell a story. The souls-games and some others in the genre tend to focus on environmental story telling, where you will find the story of what has happened/happening through the items, people, and places that you will see. Code Vein however will be far more explicit, and tends to be more like one would expect from an anime, fitting its aesthetics. The story itself is not too complex, and while not the best, is enjoyable. Especially as it has multiple endings depending on what you have done, further encouraging multiple playthroughs. Lastly, the game also features companions that accompany you throughout the story. This can be a mixed bag depending on how you feel about the difficulty. Having an AI companion certainly makes things easier, as they can help take the heat off you in a fight (especially group fights), but sometimes that can lead them to being overwhelmed as well and dying in 2 seconds. It can also make the game almost game-breakingly easy if you are used to other souls-like games that have you lone-wolf it in their entirety. You do have the option however to leave all your companions to the side and go it alone, if you do wish for that, so its nice the game has the options for you. The AI companions are not that bad, and the game does a good job in helping you get to know them a bit and understand them a bit more through events that can take place in the game. If you prefer to enjoy the company of some of these NPC's, the option is definitely open for that as well. (And certainly not just because some of them are......gifted)There is also an online component where you can have another person join your game, if that tickles your fancy, and certainly lead to fun times. Players have the option to have random people join in, or if you have a friend, you can set a password so that only those that know it can join your game. One thing to add that the game does well is that it feels a little bit more accessible in its difficulty because of the AI companions, as it makes the combat a little bit more manageable and provides a sense of not feeling alone (I'm sure there is a word for this, but it escapes me at the moment). All in all, Code Vein is an Anime inspired Souls-like game that has fun and engaging gameplay, with a story with multiple endings. You can customize ALOT in terms of appearance and gameplay and the NPCs, while it can subtract from the difficulty, are a welcome addition. If you are looking for a fun experience, and don't mind dying a few times, Code Vein is something worth looking into.P.S. Just...don't get the DLC, its content that you can literally finish in under an hour and does not offer much. If you HAVE to get it, do it during a sale as it is not really worth its current price at the time of writing. Base game is good, DLC is not...			"

Recommended,10,"																""Flawed, but enjoyable"" is how I would describe Code Vein. ""Anime Dark Souls"" is the other descriptor. Code Vein is exactly that, with many of the same parallels - makes sense, as it is developed by BANDAI NAMCO. Traverse areas as a revenant, collect haze to level up or unlock blood code abilities (classes, essentially) and fight difficult bosses. It has a really cool and expansive character creator with a wealth of options, and the game itself has some interesting ideas, but falls a bit flat overall.So, if you ever played a Souls game before, Code Vein is exactly that, with a few mix-ups thanks to the abilities and blood codes. The game is mostly fun, looks appealing and has a good soundtrack, but it does have a few flaws, namely in terms of balancing and pacing. The story is also a bit confusing and doesn't want to hit right, but most of the voice-acting is well done.Most of the game is actually rather easy comparatively, but there are a few bosses that will make you tear your hair out as they present huge difficulty spikes. Some are complete pushovers and others, especially later on, can kill you easily in two hits, without giving you any time to react. I played around a bit, but it does not seem like stacking resistances matters all too much; at most, you may be able to tank another hit, but that is about it. It makes some bosses feel super cheap, whereas others are challenging, and some are very easy. That balancing weirdness is also kind of there in the main game, with some areas having very unfair ambushes and strange enemy patterns. Whatever, it's a Souls game.What also bothered me is the pacing of the game in terms of acquiring abilities and codes. There are a TON of blood codes for no discernable reason. You can ""inherit"" most abilities by using them for a while, which means you can then transfer them to other blood codes. Technically that means you can create your own class, with every code also having different attribute levels which determine how well you can handle equipment and armor. It is kind of cool and allows for some experimentation, but some blood codes are clearly much better than others, some are very strong and others feel super weak. There are at least 3 dozen, if not more, and there is quite some overlap. That diversity does not extend to the weapons, though, as there are only few weapon types. You will quickly find your favourite weapon that meshes with the code you are using, upgrade it to the max throughout the game and that is that.  You constantly gain new blood codes, but chances are that you won't change away from what works for you, and many of them have abilities locked behind finding ""vestiges"", so it may even take some time for them to become really useful, so may as well stick to what works. For that reason, finding new codes just often seemed somewhat pointless to me. I only switched my code once about halfway through the game.Then again, it is fun to experiment and find your playstyle, though with so many codes but so few weapon types, it actually feels surprisingly limiting at times. Inheriting the abilities is also a good idea, but can take some time depending on ability, during which you may be switching to a code that is much weaker or not suited to what you are used to, and you will essentially have to ""grind"" for a bit. Technically this is all optional, but you really don't want to limit yourself to just one code with it's own abilities as you can have up to 8 active and 4 passive abilities.Anyway, I feel like Code Vein has a lot of cool ideas, but in the end it's ""just"" Anime Souls with bouncing robertsons (almost every woman has a ridiculous chest size), a wealth of options that end up surprisingly limited, a flat story with meh characters and a generally fun, but partly unbalanced gameplay loop through mostly drab areas - though a few of the areas I actually really liked in terms of creativity and looks. I will still upvote it because it ""works"" and most of my playtime has been somewhat fun, but I also feel like there was a lot of unfulfilled potential in the game and its mechanics. If you like Souls games, there is no harm to check this one out on a sale.			"

Recommended,30.4,"																EDIT cause I left some things out before.Let's first state the obvious: this is not a perfect game. I have seen lots of people's comments complaining how Code Vein is not ""Dark Souls, but anime"", and they are right, it's not, but it is a very enjoyable game with a lot of shortcommings but some aspects in which it is brilliant. The long rant:CONS:-I cannot overstate this: the dialogues are so, soooo cringe, and the narrative is so stupid that overshadows what is an underlying very good story-The abundance of cosmetics for character doesn't makes up for the very limited armor or at least aesthetic clothing (a miss here because it has lots and lots of customisation options)-The female character design is sexy but borderline hentai-Items description is stupid and nonsensical sometimes-A stupid plot twist that adds absolutely nothing to overall value of the experience but doubles up in stupidness-Annoying cutscenes that don't add depth, they just try to look cool (emphasis on the ""try"" 'cause is so obvious that ends up not being cool, just annoying)-Why so many loading screens????-Little enemy variety-The ability to change blood codes (builds) on the fly takes away gameplay depth-The fact that there is a door to DLC content in base game is undeliable proof of the horrible corporate practice of cutting pieces of the game to sell them as DLC's that everyone ends hating, just to make some more bucksPROS:-The combat is really, really enjoyable-Blood codes are a bad choice at first glance, but it turns really fun trying different builds for different areas-The ""training room"" is an awesome choice that more games need to have, it lets you actually see and quantify the effects of the gifts you equip with (gifts are abilities: the equivalent of magic and passive augments)-The story is actually good if you filter all the cringeyness of dialogues; and more than anything, the short character stories are very good (although a different delivery than ""memory echoes"" would have made them justice)-Although there is an overuse of enemy reskins, there are some enemies that are such a pleasure to figh: Black Hunters, all the female warriors, specially the Golden and the Queen's Vanguard (except those fatsos that are just big blobs with no depth to their encounters), the Cerberous units-The Guilded Knight fight is such a beautifully coreographed dance-Companions (here's a tricky one) can be pretty annoying or an absolute unit by your side, it's a matter of choosing the correct companion for the correct area, plus their abilities must have synergy with your own equipped abilities.-The combo-based combat: you don't need to always use an ability; dodge, parry and combo the hell out of enemies-Different Blood Veils have different parry windows and some drain more ichor than others, making them specially useful for ranged attack bluilds (""ichor"" is the equivalent of a magick pool, different builds have different limits and consumption effectiveness)-The fact that you have to earn mastery over gifts by using the different blood codes in battle, which actually forces you to know the benefits of different builds (unless you have enough Awake resources to unlock mastery, which is not possible in your first run)Conclussion: 70% of this game is trash, but the good parts of it more than makes up for the stupidity of that 70%. Give it a try, you might have a blast			"
Recommended,120.5,"																When Code Vein was first released, I and what I imagine to be many others wrote it off as just ""Anime Dark Souls."" And honestly that generalization wasn't too far off. Its got a universal currency that you mainly acquire from killing enemies, it has a very ""anime-esque"" art style and world, its set in a punishing grim world that will require lots of death to be overcome, and it has the classic roll, parry, backstab, and stamina system Dark souls is so known for albeit with a few minute differences. That's honestly where the similarities end though.For how much Code Vein is like Dark Souls, it brings so much to the table that sets it a part from the series that very clearly inspired it. Without going into spoilers the story, while simple, is really interesting in its own right because of how interesting the world its set in is. The cast of characters, who's backstories you explore via their bloodcodes, are so interesting. Learning how the state of the world has affected them and how they came to be where they are in relationship to you and the enemies and bosses of the world was honestly such a joy to go through the first time. The combat while very souls like is very fun and fast paced. The attacks can feel sluggish at times and the hitboxes feel strange but overall was very doable with time. Blood codes are probably my favorite thing about the class and combat system. Unlike Dark Souls where you level individual stats with your souls to create a build, Code Vein has Blood codes. You just use your souls to level up as often as you'd like and the blood code you equip changes your stats instantly to suit that class. The only thing that's asked of you is to use Haze to unlock the abilities that a certain Blood code or ""Class"" has available. And when you master certain abilities, you can use them on the other Blood Codes you unlock. Its a really neat system that does a fantastic job of promoting experimentation. Never at one point did I feel stuck with whatever class I was playing because I knew that I could just go put on a different blood code and kill some enemies in the world to get some of its abilities.  Blood Veils also add a layer to combat even if it does feel more aesthetic at times than anything. Certain bloodveils work better for certain blood code types such as magic, strength, or more dexterity focused builds. It was really fun trying different classes and seeing how my aesthetic changed, it really made playing different blood codes enjoyable on a visual level as well as a gameplay level. The other thing to note would be the bosses. Each boss felt extremely unique and fun in their own way, especially a lot of the later bosses. I also absolutely adored how each of the bosses worked on a narrative level but I won't elaborate for spoiler reasons, I would suggest finding out for yourself. Figuring out the timing for dodges or taking different approaches also made things really interesting. This goes back to the bloodcode system as well. If you're hardstuck on a boss maybe swap bloodcodes and spend a bit of time grinding. Maybe one boss is sort of resistant to magic, just swap to a strength or dexterity bloodcode and get to swinging. You won't be punished for it nearly as badly as other souls like titles.This game does have its fair share of issues though I won't lie. My main issues being some bosses are absolutely trivialized by certain blood codes or abilities. Strength blood codes are truly the culprit for this. Strength just feels so insanely strong against basically all enemies because you can just knock them over or stunlock them to death with a big weapon and strength abilities. And the same bosses I said were extremely fun to figure out is a personal bias. Some bosses have attacks that have such slim dodge windows that they can almost feel unfair at times. And in the same breadth, as much as I love being able to swap bloodcodes at the drop of a dime to make certain bosses easier, I find it annoying that some bosses are so much harder with certain approaches. I guess one of Code Veins greatest blessings is also a bit of a curse. But that's just how games work. I would hope that none of these problems I had dissuade you from the game, I just felt compelled to include them because I didn't want to seem like this review was pure praise even though I do really love the game.There's more to this game that you can find out for yourself but it is definitely worth the money. If you can get it on sale even better. I guess I'm just asking that you don't write this off as ""Anime Dark Souls"" like I imagine so many did. 10/10 would play again.			"

Recommended,51.8,"																it's 2 years later and I realize  I never reviewed this ok let's just keep it short yeah it's good since it's a souls clone let's just draw comparisons real quick so you can decide if you wanna play or not (you should tho)- You always have an AI partner there are multiple to pick from. You can choose to play solo if you'd like.- stats are determined by equipment instead of you investing in a build so you can move stuff around any time- enemy variety is very lacking and so is the level design- you can always block, effectiveness varies by each weapon- you can always parry, effectiveness and behavior varies by the armor you equip- progression comes from learning skills from gear you get (blood codes) so you can master them and then mix and match passive/active abilities from there- MP in this game replenishes from landing attacks, maximum MP increases from landing parries, backstabs, or focus heavies- focus is a unique mechanic where you get benefits from iframe dodging attacks, also builds up from being hit. Fully restores stamina so it rewards skillful dodging so you can keep attacking.- some (not all) bosses are replayable from doing depths maps. If you'd played bloodborne they're kinda like chalice dungeons- the game has a map to help you navigate it tracks where you've been and is developed by finding a thing in the area which reveals the area around you- no message system like in fromsoft souls games- no pvp by default but a mod was made if you wanna try that- co op kind of janky because you have to be in the menu and keep searching for people instead of just putting your status on ""looking for co op"" and keep playing but that's fine this game's online is dead anyway just use my wife Io.oh also i love the characters jack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cool			"

Recommended,19.6,"																Code Vein or Dark Souls the anime is game that has surprised me on many things and is an interesting take on the Souls series and is a game worth checking out if you are into anime and Dark Souls.  I found out about Code Vein when I was taking a trip to Game Stop and it was just a few days before it was released and I wanted to play the game as it looked cool and I liked the anime vibe it gave off.  Now the first thing I should point out is that the character customization, it has to be by far the best character customization that I have ever seen and there is so much to put on your character that you can pretty much make your dream waifu that also happens to be a vampire in a Souls like game.  There is a lot to put on your character and I ended up making a waifu that looks like a vampire hunter who also happens to be a vampire at the same time but she is cute.  The story for the game is well, not a lot is really said but you are given an idea on what you are supposed to do, however the world has under went an event that pretty much turned ever human into a vampire and they need blood to survive and there are called the revenants and they are made with the BOR Parasite, if a revenant does not drink any blood they will turn into one of the lost that will do anything for the lust of blood and will attack anyone who is not a revenant, the human race is almost wiped out thanks to to this event called The Great Collapse and when you are awakened you find out that you have lost your memories and must get them back whale exploring this ever cruel world.  The laws have changed as the hunt for blood increases, and you must fight the lost whale finding out more about the world and yourself, however you are not doing this on your own as you are giving a partner to help you on your mission.  The characters are all good and have their own charm to them and they are all lovable, you can take one of them to help you on your mission on getting your memories back or you can go on your own, I however liked the partner system and the AI is pretty good and your partner will save you ass on more then one occasion as they can revive you when you die, give you buffs to you or whatever weapon you are using and are really useful.  Each character has their own uses and play styles so you will end up using the one you find the most useful to you and with that they will have their own buffs to give to you.  You can learn about each characters back story by visiting their memories and learn about their past and find more about the world you are in and what had happened.  Now when it comes to game play, I have a lot to talk about.  Combat I actual like, I hear a few people say that it's clunky but I had no problem when it came to combat and you have different weapons to use, there are heavy weapons, small weapons, spears, and even a sword that also happens to a musket kind of weapon, I however liked using swords the most as that is just my type of thing, the weapons have their ups and downs and it's best to find what weapon is best for you so it's best to try them all out to see what you like to use and pick your best weapon.  Then there are the blood codes and they each have a different use to them all, they have certain perks and magic for you to use and each perk has a spell, however there are going to be blood codes that has a spell that you you want but you don't want to use that blood code, well you can max out the spell for you to use that spell on any blood code you want so you can mix and match what kind of spells that you want to use.  Now Code Vein is an anime like Dark Souls game and I will admit I have only played a little bit of Dark Souls, however I did not find it as challenging as Dark Souls, yes I did have some trouble with a few bosses but for the most part I did not really had a hard time with the game and even if you go on your own with out a partner you will get a little more of a challenge but not by much and it will probably be more easy if you are someone who plays a lot of Dark Souls.  Now if you are having a hard time with the game you can send out this distress signal for someone to come and help you take out a hard boss or get past a certain area and I did not have any problem with connection so it worked out rather well, I will admit having a partner in Code Vein is actual more fun to me at times and it spiced up the game play a bit.  Code Vein with it's Dark Souls themed game play is really fun to play, offers a great character customization, and has many play styles for you to try out and such, the story is also good, and I liked the partner system the game had going for it.  I recommend this game to people who like Souls like games and a little taste of anime and for the top tier waifu, well it goes to the waifu I made, however Io and Rin are also good waifus as well.

Recommended,119.7,"																Just finished this game, and I absolutely loved it.As a vampire revenant, your goal is to struggle to survive amidst an apocalyptic world where humanity and revenants are separated due to the danger the Lost pose. The Lost are revenants utterly devoid of humanity, and you must avoid becoming one yourself as you search for your missing memories--which are the key to unlocking the truth of the harsh world you reside in.A lovable cast of fellow vampires will aid you in this journey (I'm partial to kind-hearted pretty boy Louis, help I love him so much), and will each have their own arcs that will help enrich their characterization. The story itself is pretty phenomenal, in particular the ""memory fragment"" scenes where you can walk through characters' various memories almost as if they were a gallery.Now, for the gameplay. I'm pleased to say that Code Vein has fantastic gameplay. There are a *ton* of weapons and armor to choose from, and many different builds. The only drawback in this is that certain bosses require you to experiment, but this can also be a positive thing because it opens you up to more playing styles. Combat and exploration are a lot of fun in this game, especially with your AI companion making quips along the way. The maps are also fairly varied, and look nice graphically.Other aspects I want to praise are the multiplayer option (which I personally haven't utilized yet, but plan to later on), the killer OP, and of course, the AMAZING character creator. You've probably seen people on the Internet making all sorts of characters with it, because it's just that good. I spent an hour creating my self-insert MC, you might spend less or more, but just the option to have so many options is definitely praiseworthy.Overall, Code Vein is a spectacular game. It really has the full package: compelling story, great characters, and fun gameplay. So, grab your blood beads and come to the underworld, fellow vampires. You'll enjoy it here. ~			"

The story is ""decent"". 6/10Here's why the thumbs up is ""reluctant"". Player animation is floaty. Doesn't feel very grounded or impactful. The character and outfit customisation options are less comprehensive than you might think from looking through the examples on the community board. There are so many weapons, classes, and coats but they all feel very samey. It took a very short time to complete, even though many of the locations were padded with hundreds of samey corridors and staircases.If you like anime games and souls-like games it is worth playing, but I would probably wait until there is a sale on to buy it.

Recommended,5.6,"																it's alright. it makes me want a ""mixed"" option in the recommended for steam reviews. plays like dark souls which is no surprise since its bandai namco who published it; let us hope they don't become the publisher known for ""dark souls and its imitations"". games visually appealing, and if you're into the nsfw region of content then nexusmods has you covered. boss design and enemy design was at first very interesting, it just became a damn shame that each area had maybe 3-4 different kinds of enemies with little variation of movesets between them (as every area had its dog-AI enemy, its average humanoid, its slightly-better-trained humanoid and its smough-enemy). sidenote; i swear to god if i see one more smough-enemy thats literally the same fat lady but a slightly different colour, i'm going to call for a genocide on these bastards)probably the most glaring flaw in this game is the level design; tight corridors with enemies that pounce on you make for an interesting concept, and since weapon collision into nearby surroundings doesnt seem to be as big of a problem, you'd think it wouldn't be an issue in this either. all until you abruptly have what is essentially the equivilent of a monster house from the pokemon mystery dungeon series, where you now quickly have to manage 3 different enemies in tight, unfavourable corridors. not saying its impossible, moreso saying that it's hilariously flawed because the gameplay itself isn't suited to 1v3 scenarios. this would be fine if the mechanic was solely for when you have a companion with you, but it isn't so it defeats the purpose and creates encounters out of dark souls 2. another point on the level design. cathedral of the sacred blood. anime anor londo. the most horrifically designed area i've possibly had the displeasure of navigating due to its extensive usage of unclear direction, lack of landmarks or navigational tools outside of a minimap tool (which doesn't even do a particularly helpful job of guiding you). the first half of this section wasn't even all that bad since it was largely open, and you could clearly see where you had to go and just had to figure out how to navigate to it. the second half that gets stripped away from you and you're left praying you find the correct """"unexplored pathway"""" even though the minimap in small sections overlays your explored pathing, meaning you can't tell if you've actually been down a certain route or not due to overlapping.its a fun game dont get me wrong, i like the boss design and its overall a pleasant experience, but it's got some downright terrible sections so if you do play this game, keep it in mind			"
Recommended,3.9,"																Code Vein was an interesting journey. The world is very interesting, and the lore is well explained through the vestige system. Only after completing them all, will you understand all of the character's backstories, and how they fit together. The bosses are mostly all well balanced around your first playthrough, forcing you to get good, or grind out some additional levels. You never find yourself completely unable to progress, as there is a weapon and ""veil"" upgrade system, or alternate ""Blood Codes"" to try.The co-op system was enjoyable, but could use some tweaking, as it syncs a higher level player lower even than the person they are coming to aid, and even had times when it would fail while attempting to connect to a friend, which would only be fixed by toggling the online mode off and on again from the main menu.Of the 3 (4) endings available, playing to earn them adds enough variation to character interaction to keep cutscenes interesting, the ""bad"" end being vastly different. Overall, it was definitely worth the sale price.As a Completionist - Be prepared to grind for haze and medals at different times to unlock everything. The co-op medals in particular, requiring an afternoon or 3 of mindlessly killing the same monster, as without having a dedicated partner, this is the only way to reach the end. I also strongly recommend looking up the criteria for each ending after finishing your first playthrough, as missing one thing in particular means an entire additional playthrough with very similar cutscenes until the final 10 minutes of the story.			"
Recommended,14.5,"																The GoodAnime waifus. Character customization is easy and hilariously intricate. Character and gear art design is coherent and stylish. The class system is fun to progress through, and the abilities are varied. Weapon and gear variety is ok, but all the weapons start to feel the same 3 options: heavy weapon, spear, sword , and gun™ which is just a magic wand shaped like a rifle. Finishing moves are cool (the first time you see them). Thankfully you can turn off the cinematic camera setting when it gets annoying.The BadMovement has no weight to it. My character feels like an ice skater sliding around. The movement makes it so easy to walk behind enemies and start the back-stab animation. While locked in animation, you are immune to incoming attacks and damage. It is about as satisfying as stealth archer in an elder scrolls game.The difficulty is all over the place. The AI partner trivializes most of the game. Playing without the AI is more fun, but the encounters are scaled to two people. Boss fights feel like a completely different game and are very tedious. Their attack patterns, game mechanics, and even aesthetic in some cases, don't mesh with the other enemies in the world. Fighting them solo is a nightmare. Even in Co-op, every boss is the same loop of: wait for opening, hit boss a few times, don't get hit by boss followup. Repeat this for about 10 minutes, or until you die. Play style variety dries up quickly. Blocking doesn't really work, even with all the gear and skills possible to compliment it. That leaves you with dodge rolling constantly, parrying (really fun but risky and gets me killed constantly), and simply strafing into constant back stabs.The story didn't engage me enough. It uses little cut scene hallways; Your character has to RP walk through a haunted house style diorama while voice over explains something. There is no player engagement, so making me walk through the hallway feels like a chore. The VerdictGame is more tedious than fun. I played with a buddy who really likes the game. After 30 hours, I was ready to stop, but kept going because he liked it. I kept changing my play style, experimenting with gear and abilities to try and find the fun. I pushed through the boring story to see if it got better. After another 20 hours, I ended up back where I was: I don't recommend this game.			"

Recommended,27.4,"																So as much as i love this game I gotta admit - it has A LOT of flawsOne major one is there are two or three bosses in the game that'll just randomly turn invisible when they vanish to do a move. Like straight up bug invisible not the ""oh it's just it's power"" kinda invisible.Second is the elevators - These things in the later part of the game only work if you alt tab multiple times. This makes it seems like this wasn't set up appropriately for PC port..Third is just how the enemies track... Your PC (Player Character) will have issues with their moves whilst the enemies will glady rotate to just 360 no scope smack that ass.Honestly though I do love the game and its story that seems to be a precursor to the God Eater series. I just don't think i can recommend it unless you really want to go through all of the issues above.Also the 400 mark of honor grind achievement is stupid and lame now that the game is not played by everyone..

Recommended,17,"																Code Vein is just okay.If you're looking for a soulslike to scratch the itch, this is certainly an experience. There are lots of interesting things here, not limited to characters with giant anime tits. There are a ton of memories (classes) that you'll acquire through your playthrough. These lend themselves to cool build variety, all of which are viable ways to play. Once you master a classes' gifts (skills), you can mix and match them onto other classes to create some seriously overpowered and fun combinations. To provide an example: upon activating a particular skill, it will allow you to regenerate any damage taken overtime. Another skill lets you convert a chunk of your life into ichor (mana), effectively giving you infinite mana to use other skills. Pretty cool.While we're on the topic of ichor (mana), this is something that the game did particularly well. Hitting enemies recovers ichor, allowing you to use your skills more. Parrying and riposting enemies increases your total ichor until you touch a mistle (bonfire). This is a great alternative to something like a traditional mana bar or ashen estus flasks. The areas are extremely hit or miss with the Anor Londo ripoff near the middle of the game being the worst offender of the bunch. Bosses are serviceable. Some are great fights that will stick with me for some time and some are just damage sponges that you get to wack repeatedly until they die. The enemy design is okay. There's nothing too offensive here. Many are copy-pasted with different skins, but they all suit the environments that you'll find them in.The map system was a good idea but verticality could've been handled better within the map screen to better show the areas' height differences. The cathedral desperately needed something like this.Overall, I recommend it. There's too many cutscenes and the anime cliches are through the roof. The gameplay is good enough and the systems it presents are different, interesting and varied.			"
Recommended,86.5,"																 If you enjoy a souls-like game with a similarly interesting story but with an anime-esque visual then yes, this is the game for you. CODE VEIN…This game is something else I tell ya and the fact that it shares the same universe with the God Eater series is like the cherry on top. Not to mention the beautiful aesthetic the game has to offer, complete with photo mode to capture it. Now here are a bit more details on my take of the game: The Pros (+)  souls-game bread and butter story formula Like most souls game you start of in a desolate place alone but in this case, your not exactly alone you’ll be accompanied by your attendant Io (which you can change later in the game). As you progress through the game, you will discover that things are not what they seem to be, and you’ll be placed with a choice that will bring either ruin or hope to the caged world you live in. that’s pretty much the game in a nutshell. The part that makes it different is the fact you can gather items that will tell backstories of your companions and some bosses. That in my opinion makes the game more alive.If you are gunning for true end, I suggest you gather these items or vestiges before tackling the bosses. The tiny detail they gave is very enjoyable at least that how I felt.(+)  Detailed character creation The character creation is comprehensive, you can mess around with almost everything not to mention the huge amount of available color palettes to choose from. However, there is a very limited option on what you can do with the outfit itself.(+)  Plenty class options You can get these by finding them throughout the map or by beating bosses, each class or in this case blood codes have its own specialization and 1 unique skill that can only be used by said class. Other than the unique skill you can use the skill you’ve unlock on other classes. That is where the customization come to play! You can build your own unique build that suits your playstyle for me I went with “magic swordsman” build because I’d like to able to deal heavy damage on both melee and range.(+)  Beautiful aesthetic As I said on the beginning, the game has a wonderful aesthetic not to mention the photo mode that have a very detailed options to improve your screenshots. Some people love taking pictures of the scenery while for me I love playing around with the poses and the picture frame the game has to offer. The Cons There is not much to say about the cons of the game, however, if you are like me and plan to get all the achievements then you are probably going to have a hard time getting one specific the “Exalted Reputation” where you will need to gather 400 marks of honor from doing co-op boss runs. Now there is a workaround on the late game where you can farm this solo but still, the fact that you can barely find anyone online anymore is quite saddening.The other thing is that the main story is a tad on the short side, since I was so hooked when I tried this, I kept playing for quite some time, and bam! Suddenly I’m at the end game. that’s lowkey disappointing for me.   Verdict So did I enjoy the game? no doubt it! really enjoy every minute of it. However, there is one thing I have to say. I hate cathedral of the sacred blood with a burning passion, that map has one of the most confusing layouts in the game! even on my next runs I still get lost in there!! Nah just kidding…you will know when you get there lol. Other than that, it was pretty much a great run, messing around with builds and playing around with photo modes. All in all, if you are looking for a souls-like game I totally recommend this one.Ps. The Nekomata boss is hot! literally lmao			"

Recommended,73.9,"																Functional combat and a passably interesting skill tree make the core gameplay of CODEVEIN enjoyable enough. The lore and world are unique enough to pose some interest also.This alone would make for a good or even great game if the narrative didn't try to shove itself down your throat every 5 seconds. EVERY action involves a cutscene of several minutes, with characters explaining in ridiculous painstaking detail every facet of a story thatI couldn't care less about.For fun, after one boss, I actually timed how long it would take me to get back into  game play and it was over 20 minutes of cutscenes with trite, cliche, anime high school drama before I got back into playing the damn game.I could get picky about the repetitive enemies, boring environments, and cheap boss moves, but the grating forcefulness of the cringe worthy plot makes it unplayable. PLUS you have to watch even more scenes if you want the TRUE endingTLDR: Combat is OK, play only if you can stand the insufferable characters, or if you earnestly enjoy an anime dressup simulator hacked onto a combat based visual novel			"
Not Recommended,27.5,"																This is a trashy, fun game. If you like the Souls games because they give off a sense of adventure in unforgettable environments, or subtleties in mood and tone, this isn't here. The environments have twists and turns, but it doesn't end up feeling like a place, just a video game level. There aren't many ""aha!"" moments when navigating (there are a few), and enemies are usually fought in corridors or arenas.Though, if you like filling out maps, this game has maps to fill in. Once you get to the end of a chunk of level or reach a hidden location, there's a tree you can bleed on to reveal the minimap for the area you just went through. Often, there are areas to drop-down or circuits which take you off-route and a bit ahead of where you'd reveal the map between save points. So, there's a cute flow to exploring levels where you survive up to the save point and then double-back to reveal more, and then scout out the unexplored areas, which often lead to paths off the map, and so on. It's not smart or immersive or anything, but it's fun.The combat is very extra. Heavy hits can cause enemies to fly back, and you get a launcher. And there's an AI partner! Enemies have fair, well-telegraphed attacks you can dodge through consistently with proper timing (though watch out for lingering hitboxes!). There isn't much enemy variety (all humanoids and dogs). You've got access at any time to 8 cooldown abilities, ranging from spells and buffs and flashy attacks. It's not particularly nuanced, but there are many abilities to explore that you learn through a mix-and-match class system, and some enemies feature behaviors or elemental affinities which encourage experimentation. And you get to switch them on the fly.This is a big deal, cuz mechanical exploration is difficult to do in most Soulslikes; they usually encourage you to commit to a build and explore other avenues on new playthroughs. And that works in an RPG sense, because being stuck with your limited tools adds texture to the scenario! But on an action game level, that usually stinks. It's great that you get to rummage around in your toolbox as a response to challenges.But its god-awful storytelling intrudes on that. Every time you unlock new abilities for classes via collectibles scattered through environments, you have to go back to base and walk through voiced-dialogue-gated walking simulator dioramas before you get the goods. None of the characters in this game have a unique written voice, and for a game with such edgy visuals, all the mains are unambiguously virtuous cinnamon rolls without an ounce of depth. I hated learning about them. Normal cutscenes are painfully slow, poorly staged, and include seconds-long gaps between sentences. Very uncanny. At least it's all skippable.When people call this ""anime Dark Souls"", they aren't kidding. This is ""anime"" in the derogatory sense; it's chock full of self-serious, doughy-eyed waifs that never shut up, constantly explaining and reexplaining the story to you. Characters will writhe in agony as their lovingly rendered tits jiggle for you, and outdated-at-release nu-metal will scream weakly during weightless fight cinematics. It comes across as juvenile, but not gleefully so. I wish this game dared to be darker or sexier or more violent,. When a character cries over their dead brother while a naked water elemental spins down a stripper pole, there's no irony employed. It's stupid, plain and simple.It also has co-op, which is fun, and it isn't tied to some cost like Fromsoft games. So, co-op away!FYI, I got this in a Humble Bundle. I wouldn't recommend getting this game for full price. It's got a budget feel. But, sometimes you want a game like that, right?			"

Recommended,42,"																Fun game, just wish they would add a feature that allows you to keep fighting while you search for a player seeking help. As it stands, your locked in place while it searches, and it gets so damn boring.			"
Recommended,66,"																One of the things that really shine in this game is its character build system. There are no parameter “points” for you to distribute as you level up. You don’t have to predetermine your playstyle before everything starts only to cry at a weapon/spell you found later that doesn’t suit your build but you do want to play with. Your parameters are preset in this game as bloodlines and you can switch between them anytime you want with no cost. Want to try on a new weapon you stripped from your dead foes but your current bloodline cannot equip it? Then switch to a bloodline that can! Get bored with slashing and slamming all the time? Then switch to a casty boi in no time! Although you can’t alter those preset builds, you are allowed to combine skills from as many bloodlines as you like to create customized hybrid build. The more you progress, the more freedom you will have creating your own builds. Bosses are well-designed. Their attack moves are highly variant and bring forth some serious threats for players to counter. Maps are multi-layered and, in some maps, routes are so complicated that exploring can be quite challenging and time-consuming. Some people criticize on it but I like CODE VEIN’s map design anyway.The game has almost everything needed that can distinguish itself from Dark Souls and should have established a solid stand as a brand new hardcore ARPG series. However, CODE VEIN ruined it in the worst way possible. The game has a really serious problem. In the first few areas, you get beaten up by bosses, by mobs, by traps. Then you get up, you learn, you try again and finally you overcome. It is exactly the stereotype we love in this genre. This turns out to be a different story when you progress to the midway. There is seldom a chance any more that you CHALLENGE a boss. Instead you just simply … trample them over. Your damage output starts to become ridiculously high. Or it is the Health Points of bosses that becomes ridiculously low -- It has to be either way since you will find that you can easily out-damage any boss with a random +4 or +5 weapon in your 50s. Bosses still have lots of moves. They can still deplete your heath bar in a single hit. But they are also so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ squishy that you can kill them in such a short time before they put up any real threat. From the 4th area to the 10th area, I killed almost every single boss in my FIRST run. Most of the time the boss fight would not last for more than 2.5 minutes. They just die so easily before I even witness all of their moves. I am NOT some skilled action game player. I never managed to kill ANY boss in Dark Souls in first run, not to mention ending a boss fight in 2.5 minutes. I was always the one that get beaten up and lick the ground. It is because I failed so many times that I started to learn. It is because the enemies seem so strong and unbeatable that makes me feel like challenging them again and again. And it is this exact process that makes me feel so accomplished and satisfied in the end. In CODE VEIN, however, especially from 4th area on, most likely you will find yourself killing bosses with less effort and trust me it is NOT because your skill has improved. The game made it this way. You will see how your attacks do ridiculous damages to boss’s health bar and which you NEVER experience in ANY Dark Souls games in your FIRST RUN (In NG++++ it is possible). I really hate it when games sell false sense of accomplishment by corrupting the balance between boss’s health amount and your character’s attacking power. Killing a boss like this simply brings me no satisfaction at all. The deep dungeons are also a joke. As end contents the routes are supposed to be complicated and encounters proved hard and worthy. But disappointingly you walk on roads straight as 5th Avenue and just happen to beat up the same bosses you killed before but with EVEN LESS HEALTH POINTS. The idea of reviving boss fights for players to challenge to their heart’s content is by itself brilliant, but it makes no sense that those revived bosses are so WEAK and you can’t even fight them on equal grounds. These are no contents for you to continuously challenge and have more fun. They plainly exist to waste your time. Things may get better with DLCs coming out and bosses may not be that squishy and start to have NORMAL health bar in NG+++++, but given the experience I doubt I would spend time on new game+ in near future. In all, CODE VEIN is a decent game. Although it failed my expectation, I would have to admit I enjoyed the storyline, the animations, the fully-voiced characters and the atmosphere. Would still give a try on its sequel, were it to have one. It may or may not worth the price, depending on your taste. Recommend to: Those who enjoy anime and would like a story that do have some weight. Those who enjoy beating up bosses in various flashy ways more than getting f***** up over and over again. I love Io my waifu nomatterwhat NOT recommend to: Dark Souls maniac who expects an experience just as challenging and satisfying. 			"
Recommended,32.8,"																Great Game, almost ""played"" two hours. Spent most of the time in the character editor			"
Recommended,120.7,"																This is where I wish there was a middle grade. Not a bad game but not great either.			"
Recommended,25.4,"																I have mixed feelings about this game. On one hand, the character customization is top notch, the graphical style is relatively unique, and the game controls well. On the other, it's story is uninteresting, it's design is bogged down by numerous questionable design choices, and it contains a difficulty ""curve"" that equates to climbing up a cliff then jumping back off of it.Most of the enemies and bosses are jokes. 90% of the time, you'll see any enemy that looks intimidating just to think ""Wow, that was it?"" to yourself by the end, which will generally take about 3 seconds. The other 10% of the time, you'll be faced with mundane nuisances that serve more as a test of patience than skill. The former unfortunately made up the bulk of the game, boring me in the process. The latter generally involves the game throwing a wave of enemies at you with no consideration as to how these enemies actually function together. Dark Souls often feels hard but fair during a first play-through, while Code Vein can often feel cheap with it's approach in contrast.The bosses were one of the most disappointing aspects. Most of them were piss easy; I died to each of them once or twice at most. Several times, I achieved easy wins by simply having the boss target me while my partner dealt all the damage. Speaking of partners, the game was clearly designed with them in mind. This is a problem for three reasons. #1: Some partners are clearly better than others. #2: Your reliance upon them means that their inconsistent AI can sometimes screw you over. #3: Boss difficulty is balanced by having your partners draw some of their ire. They either produce AOE attacks that you can't reliably get through, or have attacks with both minimal wind-up and cooldown. It is certainly not impossible to do a solo run, but you have your work cut out for you. Not in a ""difficult but reasonable"" sort of way, either. It's more of a ""I'm going to sit here for the next 10 minutes, slowly chipping away at this damage sponge"" sort of situation. On the other end, most of these bosses are easily cheesed merely by having one of the better partners with you.Stat customization is EXTREMELY shallow. What little can be influenced is mostly influenced by your weapon and armor alone. Leveling up increases the same stats every time, and by a paltry amount per level. Blood Codes fill this hole in the customization in theory, but none of them ever really felt distinct from one another in practice. The most they ever offer you is unique active and passive abilities, which also never really felt like they did much outside of the occasional damage-dealing projectile.English VA's were horrible and off-putting. As is usual with Japanese produced games, they don't capture the emotions that the context of the story should give. I switched to Japanese VA's with English subs about twenty minutes into the game, because I just couldn't take it anymore. I don't actually understand Japanese aside from the occasional Arigato, so I can't criticize or praise the Japanese VA's. I did, ultimately, find them much more sufferable.Also, ♥♥♥♥ the City of Falling Flames. Mandatory damage, fire walls with bloated hitboxes, crowds of fast enemies huddled together, and your partner AI refusing to provide needed revivals because of said fast enemies keeping them too busy to do so. Everything wrong about the game merged into one area.Gameplay: 4/10, for reasons listed above.Controls: 9/10. I saw other negative reviews mention them, but I personally had few problems.Graphics: 9/10. Art-style is great, and I really dig the early 2000's style edge. Really nice vibe.Music: 7/10. It's just okay. Don't really remember much of it.Stability: 2/10. I experienced one crash a significant distance away from a Mistle. Elevators wouldn't function properly and take me to my destination without temporarily lowering the max FPS to 60. It once gave me a blue screen near the beginning of my play-through, forcing me to repair Windows with a USB and reinstall Discord, because it was broken and wouldn't launch. There is no excuse for these issues, especially so many years after this game's initial release.Overall, I'd give it a 4/10. It's closer to DS2 in quality than 1 or 3. The best part is the character creator at the beginning. The actual game part of this game, though, is incredibly mediocre. If you're so desperate for a new Souls-like that you'll even play a paltry one, get this on sale. A good sale. I'd say it's worth 10 bucks at most, and that's WITH the DLC. Don't pay more than three bucks for that garbage.If you look at the most popular reviews on the store page, it's full of people giving it undue praise, or the usual unhelpful ones screaming about anime titty and how much they like it. Don't get it twisted, I like titty as much as the next guy, and there's no crime against enjoying flawed games for whatever personal reasons you may have. I genuinely don't understand how Code Vein ever receives it's praise, though, and it's concerning to see so many people ignoring it's faults outright. Steam reviewers just have lower standards, I guess.It is a shame. That character creator is REALLY good.Edited in on January 12th, 2023:Hey, this review is gaining traction and there is one more thing I've found out about. It may be important for people to know, since a lot of eyes seem to be catching this.It turns out, this game has Denuvo. This is not clarified on the Code Vein store page: You can only find out about it by reading the Terms of Service. You know, that thing you never read because it's long and filled with legal mumbo-jumbo that you probably don't understand.So yeah, add it to the long list of reasons not to buy this game. It sucks, I was too easy on it.			"

Recommended,103.5,"																This game exceeded my expectations, it's a lot more fun than I expected it to be. It does take inspiration from dark souls when it comes to souls and revival system, other than that it's pretty much original. There are 32 classes (Blood codes) which you unlock as you progress and can switch at will. You can equip 8 active skills at once, plus 4 passive ones. You can get quite creative with your builds, changing them depending on a situation. There are 5 types of weapons and you can equip 2 at once, easily switching between them with a click of one button. The level cap is quite high, it caps at lvl 300. There's plenty of replayability value in this game. The other selling point of this game are ofc waifus and husbandos. (Lois is best boy) You can get quite creative with the character creator, although the number of costumes is rather small.The game also let's you customise pretty much on how much you want to challenge yourself. You can either play the game alone or with an npc companion (They are useful, capable of killing enemies and dealing a decent amount of damage on bosses) One thing that I disliked at times is the map design (Ugh, the cathedral), they can be filled with dead ends, and no clear indication on where to go. Other than that, great title!			"
Recommended,21.3,"																This game has a special place in my heart for whatever reason. I love the bosses as well as the weapons and lord I spent 2 hours stuck in the character customization because of how many options there are. It's like a way easier version of Dark Souls. Since I am not any good at souls-like games, the difficulty on this one was quite a breeze (apart from encountering one of the hardest bosses in the game early on). The only thing I wish I knew about before buying the game is the fact that this game game was meant to be experienced on controller. I played Code Vein with a keyboard and mouse. From my perspective, there are just too many controls I had to take note of and activating certain abilities or healing myself have become quite strenuous in stressful moments. Overall, great game and amazing graphics!			"
Recommended,55.9,"																Great game. Code Vein is much easier compare to similar games like Elden Ring or Sekiro. Weapons with +10 easily destroys any bosses. The only thing that is super annoying is player gets stuck in the freaking elevator if FPS setting is set higher than 60FPS.			"
Recommended,68.5,"																I finished the game 3 times on the console and came back to play it on the computer.

It's my favorite build that I strongly recommend you to try: Fionn, Noble Silver, Huge Hammer, Adrenaline, Overdrive, Blood Sacrifice, Gift Extension, Bridge to Glory, Dragon Lunge, Red Shoes, Impact Wave, Swift Destruction, Hammer Mastery, Mind/Willpower Up, and Survival Instinct			"
Recommended,102,"																I would recommend buying this game if you are a fan of Anime and Dark SoulsStory/Lore was great would give an 9.5/10The Main story was well written but not a masterpiece.  What I enjoyed was the different background stories of the numerous NPC in the world.  Going through their memories helps the player get in the mood for understanding the main story.  The Main story has multiple endings, so you need to play through the game multiple times to get all endings.The combat is just like any souls like game with a stamina system but with an addition of a few skills and buffs.  The game is easier with an AI partner joining you in during play through.  You can select one AI partner to join you in the world.  The game’s difficulty is comparable or even harder than Dark Souls if you plan to go solo.  I recommend bring your companion while exploring the world then going solo when fighting the boss.In terms of character progression/development not like Dark Souls with a point allocation to stats this game has an emphasis on spending your points or currency on levels which affects your HP, Stamina & Damage.  Your Stats or Build is determined by which blood code, which are the classes you can chose from in the game.  These blood codes come with different skills and passives per class.  One other thing I like about the game is that you can change blood codes on the fly.  I would rate Code Vein’s level design at a 9.5 out of 10.  World is big with many levels to explore.  It has a semi-open world where some levels connect to each other with a central hub for the player to return to for upgrading equipment and talking to NPCs.  However, they should fire the person who designed the Cathedral Level.  F*ck him.The graphics are stunning and since it is an anime game the character designs is very good.Another positive about this game is the character creation menu which has a decent selection of customization option for you to create your anime waifu or husbando.  And for those wondering the game is playable with a controller or mouse and keyboard.  However, I recommend playing it with a controllerThe only negative thing I can say about the game is that the music in the game is mediocre.  Also, that the DLCs are stupidly overpriced for what content they provide.  I recommend buying them on sale.			"

Recommended,40.6,"																Anime Dark Souls. If those 3 words don't appeal to you: Anime ARPG. These are the most succinct phrases I could use to describe this game.Graphics are great with very few visual glitches, and the soundtrack is appropriately epic for bosses. Unfortunately there isn't typically any BGM playing while you roam, so the world does feel stale and lifeless, which I imagine is the point.The worldbuilding in this game is decent and, in true Soulslike fashion, frustratingly vague. Yet you will be able to understand just enough of the story to know which way is forward... Most of the time.Level design is a nightmare for some stages, and while it is certainly intentional and it can be rewarding to explore, there's no denying that at some point you'll probably have to look up a guide on how to progress. And that's a bummer.Character creation is fairly detailed and you can certainly customize your avatar to your heart's content. There are characters here with massive boobs, sure, but there are also characters with normal chests, hunky bois, and fem bois too. No need to be turned away by a little boob jiggle physics, there is definitely variety here.Finally: Combat. This is, of course, the highlight of the game and what we came here for. It is Soulslike with a heavy emphasis on positioning and dodging, while blocking and parrying are also defensive tools at your disposal, though they require a lot more skill to utilize. Unfortunately, unlike Dark Souls you do not have full autonomy over your character's combat style and stats.Stats are determined by the Blood Code you equip, which then determine the passive and active skills at your disposal. Leveling up only increasing your HP and scales the difficulty of the enemies up. In theory, this would mean a ""Level 1 Run"" might actually result in the easiest version of the game, but I haven't had the guts to test that theory.You may carry only up to 2 weapons at any time, and you may not dual wield them. This, coupled with the fact that there are no shields in this game, pigeon hole you into an all-out-offensive playstyle with the only choice being your flavor of carnage.Overall a great 8/10 experience with notable design choices that keep it distinct from Dark Souls.

Recommended,145,"																Code Vein is a pretty fun and quite challenging game. It has a very ""anime"" story, with all of the cliches that come with it, but is nontheless, a fun ride - if you can get into the story. As i understand that for some it might feel cringy at times.The gameplay is ""souls like"", however, it is way closer to bloodborne than darksouls - as the game is way more faster... and everything is about blood :D. The enviroments while sometimes quite nice, but lack a bit of character and are basically ""cliff and city"" with a different skin layed over it, same can be said about the enemies, as they tend to repeat themselves. It's still enjoyable - don't get me wrong, but it can be off putting for somebody who comes from a game with better enviromental world building (aka: dark souls).The game is overall easier than a souls game.... if you use an AI partner. Which i won't lie - i personally did, as it made the trip feel way more fun for me, and certain bosses seem to be balanced around having an AI partner with you (although my suggestion is: use the japanese voicelines - and english subtitles - as the characters talk a lot and it can be grating with the english dub). If played solo tho - this game can definitely kick your ass (until you build a 1-shot broken build, but still).The DLC's.... only are worth it if you get them with season pass on sale - in a complete edition of the game. If not - they are a money grab with 1 zone each and a bunch of reskins, so... yea. Buyers beware.Overall a pretty fun game, took me 45h on my first run to 100%, worth it on a sale.			"

Not Recommended,22.1,"																Honestly, in trying to be a mix of Dark Souls and a DMC style anime fighter, it fails in both aspects. It's clunky when it wants to be quick and spastic when it wants to be slow. Also, it flip flops between doing environmental and non-linear storytelling and just showing the plot through cutscene and dialogue. This game biggest flaw is that it doesn't commit in any way, and kinda stumbles it's way from start to finish.I know I'm being harsh, but It's quite enjoyable for one full playthrough. I'm just being forward about its problems so anyone who reads this knows what to expect. I can't see myself picking it up again for quite some time.Get it on a sale if you're a souls fan, I'd skip it if you're not. Not everyones cup of tea. Also, avoid the DLCs, they're trash.			"
Not Recommended,35.9,"																I started playing this game just because I heard that it connects in some way with God Eater. It's the first Souls-like game I've played, so it took some time for me to adjust.The difference from other Souls-like games is AI partner, which made it easier for me to go through the game. (not to mention that Yakumo got one of my favorite voice actors in JP)The only thing I hate about this game IS Cathedral of the Sacred Blood!			"
Recommended,48.6,"																First let me say that this game has one of the most impressive character creation tools I've ever seen. If there's one thing it does right, it is delivering on its promise to let you create the anime protagonist of your dreams. I really wish I could end it right there, because truly a lot of effort went into its creation. Sadly though, from there on you have to actually play the game, and while it isn't terrible, it left me sorely disappointed. Combat is just too floaty, with some really pathetic hit stun, making you feel like you are fighting ghosts instead of creatures made of flesh and blood. It also partially contributes to the wonky balance. Generic enemies in large hordes pose a great risk, and will need careful management of cooldowns and attacks to overcome. Meanwhile, bosses, which should be standout encounters, are hilariously underpowered doormats. I think I died once to a single boss so far.The levels are, at least thus far, quite boring as well. Each area is a maze of broken concrete, with little to no landmarks, and the one area so far that was visually distinct somehow managed to be more boring, repetitive and visually painful to look at. It doesn't help that texture work is bad, even considering the anime aesthetic. Then finally there is the story. Boy if you love yourself a generic anime plot spread way too thin, are you in for a treat. Every character is basically the same trope, saddled with a troubled past, and now just wanting to do what is right no matter what. If you are looking for some good vampire fiction, look elsewhere. Even Twilight vampires had more shades of grey than these vanilla cutouts. The game also has no respect for your time. Cutscenes take forever, with characters loudly and meticulously spelling out every single plot thread, often repeating the same thing over and over in stilted dialogue. At some point it became quite unbearable, but luckily it can be skipped, so, there is that at least.Apart from the above, the game generally works fine. It just doesn't remotely feel like it is worth the asking price. If you are absolutely starved for a soulslike experience, you might dare to check it out. But everything about its design will highlight in some way or another what other games do better.			"

Not Recommended,29.1,"																Code Vein is a good waifu simulator. Nothing more.Stiff gameplay, grind heavy (optional), dull story telling and more brings me to the conclusion that this title is not worth its price tag..Visually, the game looks good. But certain levels, like the cathedral, are a strain on the eyes.I can not understand why anyone would choose a lackluster design like this for such a big and important level.Story wise, you get an interesting story at it’s core, but you have to listen to minutes of dialog in other characters ""memories"" with no animations and nothing to do. It’s a pain to get a couple of memories fragments and then be “forced” to listen to dialog without end.Gameplay reminds me heavily of the Dark Souls series, but even more stiff than DS1.Controls are alright, but could be enhanced. Weapons feel like paper. A gigantic Sword hits an enemy with almost no impact.But most weapons feel meaningless anyway. Focus on less weapon choices and make a couple of meaningful weapons, please. Why should I be able to get some of the strongest weapons from the NPCs at the base? I got it way too early. Anything I find is useless.On top of that: Backstab/parry attacks take way too long. You are invincible during these animations, the resulting damage is great, plus: you get extra “Mana” to spend on skills. Therefore, you want to use them as much as possible, right? No. It’s a burden to watch the same animation over and over and over again. I rather play without it.Icon usage. Anything is a white icon. Usable items to giftable items, resources for upgrading, skills, weapons, armor. You can’t tell what it is what. It's insanely hard to memorize these icons, which resulted in neglecting usable item in general. I'm slowly starting to neglect skills too. Not just because you can not differentiate them, but grinding the needed currency/experience to unlock them is even worse.Grinding is optional. You unlock a new memory, you listen to it, and here we go, new skills set from another archetyp.Yay? No, grinding. You require currency from fallen foes, like souls in Dark Souls. Kill enemies, gain currency, unlock skills. That takes some time due to many available skills, but It's all right. What's bad is that you have to grind even more after unlocking a skill. Skills come from archetypes. You can choose any archetype at anytime to use its skills. But you want to choose the archetype you like and put skills from other archetypes into them. In order to do that, you have to level your bought skills with experience from fallen foes, which takes way too much time.There are so many skills, many of them are look dull. Some have good effects, but most of them feel useless to me. Most skills look lame, some look okay-ish. Some do reasonable effects or damage, but you don’t need them.The Character creator is awesome. I wish any game would let me choose almost anything to be rotated and put almost anywhere. Creativity and understanding of the editor brings big potential to char creation. In my opinion, Code Vein is an excellent proof of concept, but not a good game. Its heavy emphasis on waifus, bouncy boobs and animations like “watch your waifu while sleeping” and “watch your waifu while bathing” was effort which was expended on behalf of refined gameplay.			"

Recommended,52.8,"																So I could open this review the same way 99.9% of steam users do ""LOL CHARACTER CREATION IS THE HARDEST BOSS I'M STILL MAKING MY CHARACTER THUMBS UP!"" Yes, the character creation is cool but, I feel that this isn't doing the game justice and several people will brush the recommendations due to the ""LOL CHARACTER CREATION""  meme. Is this game anime Dark Souls? Nope. It is more God Eater meets some elements of Dark souls. You'll notice several tropes from both Dark Souls and God Eater. The game is fun it feels like a dungeon crawler with cool bosses to kill. The blood codes and powers you get from blood codes give the game a lot of customization on your play style. Honestly I think the fact that reviews keep comparing it to Dark Souls so much is making them miss out on some of the games own merits. It is not Dark Souls. It is an action RPG, the game can be challenging but it is not Souls level of hard. It has its own feel of combat with its own features. It is way more story focus than Soulsborne games. So do you like crazy anime plots? Do you like action RPGs? if you said yes to either then I can recommend this game without a doubt.The game appeals to me greatly as someone whose two favorite games of all time are Bloodborne and Persona 4 Golden.If a review starts comparing the game to dark souls and gives it a negative review then I'd say their review isn't doing the game justice. Also to the people below making remarks about how ""It just doesn't compare to Sekiro."" The games aren't comparable, Sekiro was so far from the souls formula it is hard to compare that game to Soulsborne.8.5/10			"

Recommended,31.1,"																Excellent game so far. I""ve played enough to give it a solid review. I have only encountered one bug so far, which is is a trade menu bug (don't swap menus too fast it will bug and then you cant leave the menu), Performance is ok, it runs well enough, there are times of choppy FPS, but it isn't so bad to tank your gameplay. The FPS drops are rare so I don't throw too much shadow here. The plot is something out of an anime so yeah lives up to the name: Anime Souls. On that note: Anime Souls has the most indepth character customization I've ever seen period. You will put over several hours if you are really picky with your character.It plays ALOT like a Dark Souls game, but not quite as punishing. The AI companion you have, blunts the difficulty quite well, so if you want the masochistic experience, leave your partner behind. You will get it. The most unique characteristic of the gameplay is quite simply: the flexibility of your builds. Unlike Souls, your build can be swapped on the go, so you not need multiple characters to play a different way. The base of any build is the blood code, that forms the base of your stats, from there, you choose your blood veil, or armor. Or can choose between a veil that amps attacks/magic or defense. Between the two types, you can choose one by how they amp your stats. So you can stack a Lighter Weight Blood Veil with a lighter blood code build in order to use a Greatsword you normally could not use with that blood code. And it gets better, once you use a code enough, you ""inherit"" the skill/magic called ""gifts"" so you can use it with different codes. Not all 'gifts' can be inherited. Some are code locked. Most however are inheritable. And if you are feeling lazy, you can use an item and Haze(currency of the game) to unlock the gift for inheritance.Leveling is a one stop shop, all stats are handled by blood codes, and defense and offense is weighted with Blood Veils and Weapons. SO build flexibility is the game. If you like swapping builds constantly, you WILL enjoy this game. I will leave this review with one last thing: Anime Bewbs...That is all.			"

Recommended,67.7,"																WHY HAVEN'T I PICKED THIS UP SOONER?!!!An amazing take to the Anime-souls-like gameplay! This is the most powerful I've felt in any souls-like game ever. Here are the things that hooked me into this game.1. Great build choices and numerous abilities to choose from. Let me preface this by saying that they did an amazing job in balancing class choices and the way the ""proficiency"" system works. To put this simply, if you want to play as a teleporting-sword-mage that could absolutely nuke everything whilst maintaining mobility, you can very well do that. The way the proficient system works is that if you hop on another class, you can master their skills by just killing monsters. Once you have the skills you want mastered, you can switch back to your main class and have the mastered class abilities usable on the class you want to use. In other words, players can be very flexible on what skills they want on the specific class they want. You can mix and match however you choose! 2. Great storyline! Do not believe other reviewers calling the story ""generic"" as the storyline is pretty unique and very well told so far. A lot of lovable characters as well, and the main character doesn't feel out of place like in Dark Souls. The main character is very well part of the world, and completely revolves around him/her. YOUR CHARACTER IS A MAJOR PART OF THE STORY, AND YOU WILL BE IMMERSED, I GUARANTEE IT.3. Soundtrack - One of the best I've heard in a while. Main menu theme will make you sit there for at least 10 minutes because you're in awe of it. TRUST ME    Visuals - Anime inspired. In addition, the character designs are very unique and flashy. The world is also well fleshed out and looks stunning, despite the post-apocalyptic look.    Gameplay - As I've said, it's souls like, but in my opinion it's much faster and stays true to the anime-genre of games where you have a plethora of abilities to use. They also have Bloodborne's chalice dungeons here, in this game it's called ""Depths"".This game is on sale right now! PICK IT UP, YOU WON'T REGRET IT! 10/10			"
Recommended,55.3,"																As a Dark Souls/Souls-like fan and especially an anime fan(Yes, call me a Weeb, if you want.), Code Vein catched my eyes like it wanted to be the ""game"" that I always desired: Dark Souls, but anime. On first stare, it looks pretty similar to another anime-game series which I also enjoy: God Eater. Now of course the question occurs for me and probably for some of you: Is it worth buying? Story: Without spoiling anything, I think the game has a good story. However, you have to make a little digging into the story itself to understand it properly. You will definitely not understand everything by just dialogues, interactions with companions or cutscenes while you travel through the world, which in my opinion is a better way of telling a story by making the player feel ""immersed"" in the story rather than just putting the story on a table and end it right there. (Of course, that feels similar to Dark Souls.) Story overall feels unique and doesn't feel boring either. It has much emotions packed into it, which makes the story experience way better. And yes, I did cry once while I played the game. Characters in the story that got introduced feel unique and have their own quirks. Gameplay: I mean, it's a Souls-like game, what do you expect here? It plays very similar to it. You can customize your own character, and oh damn, that has a LOT of options to make your ideal waifu or husbando as hot as possible. Ingame you move around like every Souls-like game. However, it's not a complete copy of the game series: You can decide if you can bring a companion with you through your journey or not, which makes the game harder. However, I feel like if you use the same partner, who deals a lot of damage, all the time, then it feels pretty dull over time, especially in a boss fight. You and your partner would just kill the boss off in one or two tries (depending on your skill level). Unlike Dark Souls, you can switch between the classes and builds that you want to play with, which gives you way more opportunities to test out all the weapon types in different ways. There is no weapon type in the game that you can consider ""broken"" or ""useless"". Each of these weapons feel balanced and are worth trying out. Gifts and Passives, which can change the journey quite a bit, help you out during normal and boss battles. They are not overpowered and have a perfect line of ""being used in a battle"", instead of discarding them right after you obtained them. One problem I have with the gameplay is hitboxes. Yes, it's a Souls-like game, so hitboxes shouldn't even be mentioned, right? Because they are kind of dumb, right? Well, the same goes with Code Vein. Either, you are standing next to an enemy and you deal no damage to it, because you somehow did not hit it, or the enemy or environment hits you in a weird way that shouldn't have hit. Overall, pretty good gameplay, which shouldn't get boring for a long time of playing. Sounds/Music: Oh boy, my favorite topic of this game. Main reason for this is: it fits. In every situation. Normal fighting music is great. Boss fight music is fitting, however kind of disappointing that every boss doesn't have their own boss theme, but that is not a critique point. Probably the best track in the game is when you enter a vestige scene aka a memory of a companion or a character who you've never met in the game. That track gives out a really relaxing, but also sad tone to it, which gives every memory of a character emotions. It's really worth it to listen to a track or two somewhere else out of the game to experience this wonderful eargasmic feeling again. Graphics: This is a short section: I usually play games on low to normal settings to avoid any unnecessary framedrops, but even on those graphics settings, the game looks pretty stunning and good. It doesn't look outdated either, since it's also for the current console generation.  Replay Value: Because this game also has New Game+, it's worth it to replay the game to make enemies harder, while keeping most of your progress (except the story and exploration, of course) with you.Now to round-up my opinion on the game: It's a really good game, of course it needs some improvements in some places, however that doesn't affect me in the slightest, because I just have so much fun while I play this Weeb Souls of a game. I recommend it to everyone who likes both Dark Souls and Anime. It could also be a good starter for any players who want to start Dark Souls, since it gives you the option to have a companion, which makes the game easier but still enjoyable.			"

Recommended,14.7,"																CODE VEINIf Dark Souls had an Anime styled practice mode.GameplayCode Vein is a Souls-like JRPG. If you are not familiar with what that means, it basically means you will find yourself in a challenging world with only a few, unlockable savepoints and fence off against overwhelming (hordes of) enemies in overwehlming combat situations and try to make progress in a game that intentionally tries to kill you and reset your recent grinding and progression achievements every step of the way.Dying is part of the experience, for every minion can put up a difficult challenge.If the genre itself is no news to you, most likely because you have already seen/played the founder of the (Dark) Souls-like genre, saying it basically is a ""cuter and notably easier/more forgiving Dark Souls"" sums up Code Vein pretty well.But in what ways is it easier than Dark Souls?The most notable differences would be that there is no PvP and hence no unwanted pink agility dudes invading you every five minutes, you can permanently run around with a NPC companion that can be a notable help in combat, but more importantly heal and even revive the player (more on that later), and that ranged weapons are rather melee weapons that use ranged attacks as weapon skills, using the skill points one can and has to easily regenerate in battle. Oh yeah, and you can have eight different active and four different passive skills from any unlocked skillset equiped at a time.So yeah, first you can create your heavily customizable character, that will remain silent and only ever nod for the rest of the otherwise well written story. Even though you CAN give him/her one of multiple voices and use preset quick (voice)chat messages with your coop partner.Then, choosing 2 at a time from a variety of weapons, each with unique attack patterns and weapon skills from 5 different categories and equipping some skills from many different skillsets, besides your trusty ""Blood Veil"" - your armor, determining the special attack/parry move you have and with which of the known Dark Souls attributes and skill affinities (light and dark) you synergize with/can use, you then set out into a dangerous world consisting of several large, well designed levels with lots to explore, treasure to find and oppurtunities to die. All of which you of course have to find scattered throughout the world or dropped from enemies, and then upgrade with materials that you too find in the world and from enemies.Unlocking skills and leveling your character (which only affects general strength for attributes/affinity is controlled solely via the equiped Blood Veil) is done by spending totally-not-souls from the numerous enemies you slay, which will be dropped as a handy carepackage once you die and be gone forever when you do it again before picking it up - same old, same old.The various NPC companions you unlock throughout the story can be gifted random crap you find in the world to raise their affection, unlocking you unique trades for items, cosmetica and usually their unique weapon. Besides the general store NPC and upgrade NPC, which update their offers based on story progression.Now you just need to learn about the dozens of different element damage type that will screw you up, the carrying weight of your equipment and the attack patterns of more enemies and challenging bosses than you want to fight, and you are ready to go on your deadly adventure!Like I said earlier, healing and even reviving is a thing. Healing works just like you'd expect from Dark Souls - there is a refillable healing item which can be upgraded in healing amount and charge count throughout the story. Also there are some skills granting you slight regeneration in combat.But there is an always available skill (and more efficient version of it) for you and your NPC companions, that let's you sacrifice your own health to slightly heal your allies, and even revive them within ~1 second after death. Yes, a very strict timing that can easily fail in intense combat or due to slow reaction.Content & RuntimeTelling a rather easy to follow, well developed story guideing your protagonist's journey to save the world while also finding out who he/she is and what the f- happened in the first place, spanning across three different endings, you can easily expect around 60 hours of gametime - of course then offering the options for New Game+ to see the other endings (it's worth it), helping random coop partners with deadly levels of lag or just grinding to max out your character.The gameplay is smooth, probably falling in the category ""easy to learn, hard to master"", and the combination of challenging combat and rewarding story after a hard earned victory keeps you going even after several failed, frustrating attempts.Just like Dark Souls, but with fancy, good looking Anime style graphics.The story is told with a variety of more or less well animated cutscenes, alongside in world dialogues. The voice acting is offered in both okay-ish English and Japanese.The controls are obviously designed for controllers, but just like Dark Souls - although some people will heavily disagree with me here - can be quite comfortably played with mouse and keyboard.The DLCsLet's make this short.Just - no. Considering you take the overall cheaper option and get the Deluxe Edition - a discounted version of the... *yucks* ""Season Pass"" with bonus content, which already is a cheaper DLC bundle - all you are greeted with is some kinda gamebreaking early game content giving you an alternatively styled version of a ranged companion you usually just see halfway through the story, available from the very beginning due to it being it's own ""character"" and her entire skillset.The included 3 DLCs are literally just 3 copy and pasted after-end-game boss arenas with a small ""level"" around it, featuring lots of reused but highly buffed enemies you know and a boss you have to grind dozens of times under different conditions to unlock mostly cosmetics.Yay.ConclusionIs this game worth it?If you like Souls-like games but want it a fair bit easier than actual Dark Souls, with easier to understand lore and Anime style, or just another challenge to tackle, Code Vein is a viable choice to consider.No matter if playing alone, or with a friend, the base game offers several hours of content to enjoy.And remember, there is always another sale.Helpful review?

Recommended,309.8,"																This is kind of a hard game to recommend, but I did enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys JRPGs. The story wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't terrible. The unique multi-class system wasn't nearly as complicated as I thought it might be, which was a good thing in this case. It adds a lot of diversity, but the downside is that I never felt like I had time to experiment with builds because I was so focused on unlocking all of the abilities, then immediately switching to unlock new abilities. I rarely played with an optimal build unless I was getting my ass kicked in a boss fight.Speaking of boss fights: they're very inconsistent. Some were fairly challenging while others only took a single blind attempt without even changing my build. The most unusual part was that it had nothing to do with where you were in the story, as in: bosses don't get gradually more challenging as you progress through the story. The difficulty of each one just seems totally random (which could be partially due to whatever build I had at the time I encountered each particular boss).I'm a player who does everything they can before advancing the story. I realize that this game is intended to be played again in NG+, but I just wasn't really craving more by the time I reached the end (like I was with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice). Plus, it's essentially impossible to unlock abilities after you've chosen to level up beyond a certain point. Each time you choose to level up, it becomes harder to unlock abilities. At a certain point, the only way to do it is by collecting rare items and spending points to unlock them instead of fighting as intended. This essentially caps your level if you care about unlock all abilities. And, if you level beyond that point without realize all of that, there's no way to go back.Side-quests are super basic and felt un-intuitive. You have to regularly revisit previous maps and look for icons. It would have been nice if there was an indicator in the fast travel screen so you didn't have to waste time loading every map to see if it had an available quest.I get the impression that the developers designed this game to be replayed to unlock everything and get the other endings, but one playthrough was all I felt inclined to give this game. Idk. Maybe one day I'll get really bored and pick it back up, but I doubt it.I know I complained a lot, but I did actually enjoy playing this game. The character customization options are extensive. There are myriad gear and ability loadout options. Some of the puzzles were genuinely challenging. The environments lacked some micro detail, but a few of the maps were quite impressive.There are also some other issues I had with the game, specifically the way choices affect the various endings. VAGUE POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD: If you collect all the memories leading up to a boss, you're given two options after each fight: leave through a door or interact something in front of you. I did a full clear of every level and always interacted after each fight because I just thought that's what you were supposed to do (I didn't realize that I was taking an option that's only available by doing full clears). One time, about 35 hours in, I got curious about the door and wondered what would happen if you went through it instead of interacting. There was no warning message or anything. I went right through the door and immediately got a bad feeling. After looking it up, I found out that I was on track to complete the game with a ""perfect"" ending, and I just ruined it. There was no way to go back and interact. I know I could replay the game and get the perfect ending, but I didn't feel encouraged to do that after I played a perfect game and the only reason I didn't get it is because I got curious and ruined it in 5 seconds.

Recommended,503.3,"																I love the story so far. The game is doing the souls-like genre good and if you are familiar with DS3 it will be fairly easy to adapt to this one's gameplay; you'll also notice several features that you're accustomed to such as bonfires, dropping souls upon death, backstab, parry system etc. while also having new mechanics introduced that offer a lot of replayability as you can combine abilities from different types and create unique builds with them. Game has 3 endings I believe, I've yet to reach that phase but I'm definitely looking forward to it! The first two hours will be spent in character creation screen - it's really in depth and awesome so there's that for the skyrim fans out there =)			"
Recommended,52.4,"																Interesting take on the Souls formula. The ""vampire""-like abilities and themes are fresh, and ""Blood Codes"" are reminiscent of the Jobs system in some Final Fantasy games, making it easy to just experiment with different things as you discover them.What really surprised me is how invested I became in the world and the characters in it. In the trailers I saw ""Dark Souls but it's anime,"" and at the time Elden Ring was just a silly myth, so that was all the marketing I needed. But after playing it, I was genuinely intrigued by the characters and their stories, memories, and worldly attachments. Having one of these companions around to help in the fight was a fresh addition to the genre; it always feels good knowing someone has your back.The flexible class system does make for poor replayability (possible pro?), unless you want the multiple endings (possible con, given the replayability?). There is stuff to do after the credits roll, however, in the form of Depths. If you have played Bloodborne they're similar to the Chalice Dungeons; not really any story, just some tilesets, mobs to kill, stuff to get, and re-used boss assets.If you can get past the obvious fan-service and some typical JRPG cheesiness, this is one of the better ""Souls-like"" games out there.

Not Recommended,37.5,"																Its a really solid game! I recommend it. I have only had it for 1 week and i already sunk 42 hours in this game. Its quite challenging which can be either fun or frustrating. I do have to mention one thing though. One of the maps is a pain in the ass. I had to get a friend who had well over 200 hours in the game to help me navigate it and it still took around 2-3 hours. But besides that it truly is a really solid game. It has a nice story. Plenty of possible builds. At least 4 endings(that i know of). If you like Dark Souls type of games this is 100% for you. And for those who haven't played Dark Souls(like me) if you are bored and want a challenge buy this game and give it your best shot.			"
Recommended,58.8,"																High-quality anime-soulslike, featuring Vampire zombies. If you hate anime or don't care about story, this isn't for you. I recommend Japanese voices. Don't buy the DLC's.A few comparisons to Dark Souls:-Actually very interesting story that gets told through Cutscenes, dialogue and ""walking through memories"". You will get the plot without needing to watch Lore videos or reading item descriptions.-Every important NPC has an interesting story to discover, that is TOTALLY worth discovering-The game is balanced around having one of several NPC companions with you (As the story progresses, and depending on some choices you make, there are about 6 in total to choose from at every ""Bonfire"". If you want to play Solo, you can do so too.)-You can change your ""class"" on the fly. It's a genius system that's easy to understand.-There's only 1 repeat bossfight in the story if you do an optional area.-The game progression is quite linear (which makes sense bc it's a more story focused game than Dark Souls), but the levels are big with a lot optional ""branches"" to explore			"
Recommended,45,"																I am yet to finish the game but I have enjoyed it immensely.The story so far has the usual anime tropes, yet the story doesn't force every single fc that the MC meets to just suddenly like them, I feel like if I spoke more about the story, I'll just end up spoiling it.If you like anime, get the game, the story so far is worth it (if on sale), if you don't like anime but like great stories then grab it!Now I can't really say much about the combat, I've never played a souls-like game before (I've experienced elden ring, but I only have 8GB of ram as I'm making this so... refund!) but now I think I know how it feels to finally beat a boss that you died several times to, it feels so FREAKING GOOD.For how I'd recommend you to play IF you wanna use this game as an ""entry"" for the souls-like genre then play without a companion, its gonna be hard but it wouldn't be a ""souls-like"" if it wasn't, boss fights wont also feel as rewarding, which I think is what makes souls-like games fun.If you wanna have fun and enjoy a greatly written story then play with a companion, yakumo or IO is your best bet if you don't wanna practice the combat system too much.A mix between the two? get Mia as your comp, she's ranged most of the time.

Recommended,65.5,"																A souls-like game with anime characters is something that at first, sounded strange to me. I love the two things separately, but I wasnt sure if I would feel the same when meshed together. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is fun. The combat, the map designs, the bossfights, and the sick abilities create such a fun experience. Although there is one thing I dislike, which is the sheer amount of cutscenes, one after the other. I counted five cutscenes in a row at one point! This is not a huge deal though, since each cutscene only takes one click of a button to skip. Overall, I would definitely recommend you play this game, if you arent sure about dropping 75 bucks just yet, there is a free demo.			"

Just go into controller configuartion, turn off ps4 controller support and all other options except for generic game pad configuration and you will get ps4 button prompts :)			"
Recommended,207.2,"																“Anime Dark Souls” is what a lot of people call this game and it’s mostly exactly that. But at the same time, it has a number of differences, for better or worse.First of all, the aesthetic part – instead of depressing dark fantasy we get edgy vampire anime with big boobs, power of friendship and abilities that allow you to literally teleport behind enemies and go “nothing personnel keed”. This results in a mostly engaging story that unfortunately feels like anime filler during some expositional cutscenes (we get it Yakumo, you like onigiri and that makes you a more human character, but do we really need spoon feeding like this). That being said, in some other cases, the game succeeds at telling some short and touching stories about the characters so it’s not all bad. Speaking of filler and / or touching things, the music of this game is often hit or miss – the regular ambient and combat themes quickly get old but some later bosses and memory vestige parts have really good tracks. If we compare Code Vein to Dark Souls in terms of levels, unfortunately a lot of them feel like a bunch of separate dungeons, loosely connected with long loading corridors, while in Dark Souls you could see the locations connect in a meaningful way and have architecture that has some logic behind it. On the topic of character designs, the customization options for your protagonist are both vast and limited. It’s relatively easy to put some effort and make the perfect young and energetic anime waifu / husbando that looks like a canon character, but you can’t really make older people, the clothing options are a bit limited and the accessory equipment limit can create some difficulties if you want to create something really elaborate.The combat might not feel as polished as Dark Souls overall but the Blood Code system and the ability variety make up for that. Blood Codes are classes which have certain stats (say, a Fighter has better Strength stat than some wizard) and abilities that you can unlock and master. When you master an ability that can be inherited (most of them are), you can equip it on a different Blood Code, allowing you to have a decent amount of build variety to suit your tastes. You can even switch your abilities and Blood Codes in the middle of combat if you are quick with the menus and don’t have abilities that are on a cooldown. There is also an interesting Drain mechanic that involves replenishing your Ichor (the resource you use to cast spells) by attacking, parrying and backstabbing enemies, forcing you to actually attack enemies up close from time to time even if you use a magic build.The game also has a heavy emphasis on using NPC partners or real people in co-op. While the game is completely beatable solo (though some rare encounters feel really unbalanced for singleplayer), having a partner makes it easier and you also gain access to some powerful abilities that you can use only if you have a certain partner (for instance, with Louis you can get a buff to your dodge that turns it into a teleport with even more i-frames and better recovery than a fast roll). And while there are no invasions in multiplayer, spamming emotes and fighting bosses in co-op is still pretty fun.Overall this game has problems but I thoroughly enjoyed finishing it and might go back later for NG+ / DLCs, especially considering there are multiple endings and some Blood Codes are exclusive to certain routes. I also hope this game gets a sequel one day – much like Nioh, another game inspired by Dark Souls, the core ideas are great but need some refinement. 			"
Recommended,72.5,"																I learned one thing, it does not matter if it is in the middle of the end of the world, just sit down… eat onigiri with epic music in the background, just talk about the onigiri and what it means… how it is the meaning of life. Beautiful. And just accept some stories just aren’t that deep, and that’s just how it is. I like the mechanics and Yakumo’s semi-condescending pep talk!			"

Recommended,96.4,"																This game is absolutely fantastic! I have spent so many hours on it and have played through the game several different times. While the game may not be as relevant as the dark souls series, the game offers an equally fun experience. The combat system in this game deserves much praise as the way you can customize your character, no I mean really. While the game may not be as difficult and the level designs aren't as appealing in some areas, as a lot of souls like games, the game makes up for it for it's awesome storytelling and a bunch of character development for most of the characters. I am especially fond of Mia, although I do see a lot the fan base fond over Io. Some people may say that the story is a little bland and some progression has been rushed a little, I appreciate every little aspect that was put into these characters and the story as well. As for dlcs, I was a little disappointed overall but the them combined wasn't a totally bad experience, pretty much why you get the season pass (on sale). I also like the connection this game has with god eater since the devs hinted that they are in the same universe. Well overall conclusion, I give this game 9/10, despite a lot of it's flaws, I rated this game over the overall experience, you should go grab a copy whenever when it's on sale.			"
Recommended,22.1,"																Don't get me wrong, the game is nice. The characters is lovely, the scenery is mesmerizing, and the story is... meh, also, anime tiddies. BUT, that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon. Cathedral Of The Sacred Blood. It's a maze, and you  think it's just a regular maze? NO, this game has ladder and you can drop down to platforms. That is not just a maze, that's spherical maze. And you know what makes it worse? WHITE, A LOT OF WHITE. As far as you see is WHITE, most of the dungeon is white. For a while it's not a big problem, but, what if you grind level there or got lost? and you stuck there for hours. Let me say, that is not very pleasant experience for me. It tire my eyes really fast and frequently makes me dizzy, And i need to concentrate at some point so the monster don't kill me. That one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon, is one massive torture chamber. So, yeah, if you think you can endure through that and the game is discounted, go on.			"
Recommended,31.3,"																Combat is terrible and not because it's ""punishing"", it's just heavily unresponsive and it's extremely hard to get a feel for the hitboxes. Mob attack timings also feel very wonky and it doesn't seem like it's even possible to dodge some of the attacks. If your partner dies, you die as well after you get hit once because you'll just get stunlocked and whacked - and you can't even heal or cast a spell without a partner because your animations are too slow and mobs will always hit faster.Now, these are probably skill issues and I accept that. If I spent another 30 hours and actually tried improving rather than rushing to the end of the game, I'd probably be able to just not get hit once and all of my issues would be solved. But then what is even the point? The story, atmosphere and characters aren't bad at all (not great, either, probably 7/10 if I had to rate them), but you're basically running around maps that are all extremely similar in design (or just all the same, in case of depths) and whacking 3 or 4 types of reskinned mobs with almost identical attack patterns. There is no variety at all, which kills any desire to replay the game and/or actually bother improving. I tried to like this game, but nah, though I ultimately don't regret getting it on a sale and playing through the story once.			"

Recommended,29.2,"																It's got a pretty good story with the endings feeling different, and the ability to replay the game at the same difficulty to speed run the other endings if desired. While at the start it isn't the most diverse in Blood Codes as you go along you start getting pretty unique ones and the abilities can almost be used anywhere with the right Stat increase passives. All in all, my entire time playing this game has been a joy and I would say if you see it on sale and want to dip your toes into what a souls-like game feels like this is a good option.			"
Recommended,5,"																 Zero's Unbiased Reviews!  Personal Score:   7.5/10  Level Design: 8.5/10  A lot of time has been spent making the levels for this game, and it definitely shows. The tight, winding paths and the big, open areas both have a lot of detail, while keeping the play area nice and compact. The changing in different heights in certain levels show prowess in keeping us on our toes at all times, searching every nook and cranny for some secret or hidden enemy. Some of you who already play this game know the one area I'm talking about when I say ""Which devil on the team decided this was a good idea?"" before crying in the corner out of sheer confusion. But you know for a fact a lot of work went into that level, despite the sheer madness of it. Combat: 7.5/10 The premise of the combat in this game is comprised of your usage of weaponry, Veil and Blood Code. The amount of interchangeable parts of each blood code means you can very well create a favourite blood code that compliments your playstyle perfectly. The, frankly, huge mix of abilities you can give yourself is brilliant, complimenting melee with ranged or buff abilities to really maximise your damage against the mobs. The Ichor system is used to keep this in check and to stop certain builds simply powering through everything is strict, but not to the point where it is useless. It feels more balanced than anything else. Gameplay: 7/10 The general gameplay of this game is very good, slaughter your way through the mobs of the Lost to reach the next mistle, rest up and carry on. The large mix of consumables to aid you is a good touch, though not always necessary. Levelling is done by gaining a certain amount of ""Haze"", and is more used like a general power level than any specifics, as that's covered by the blood codes. The bosses is, unfortunately, where I feel the gameplay drops points. While some bosses keep the challenge level high, others feel more like they were thrown into battle rather under-equipped for what you throw at them. This is very noticeable mid game, whereas early and late game keep the balance a bit better. Level mobs are nicely balanced, combining ambushes, quick/heavy enemies, and large, powerful mobs who can, and will, make your day go from bad to worse if you don't keep an eye on them. Visuals and Sounds: 8/10 Personally shocked when I saw the very low PC requirements for the game, i was shocked when they were not lying  at all.  Even at very low specs, the graphics are beautiful. The volume of high quality textures is brilliant, albeit a bit jumpy at longer ranges, while the sounds do feel very visceral and detailed. The music in the game is well done, while maybe having a rather small selection in play. However the quality is high and does add to the mood very well. Story: 6/10 Now...the part I was dreading a little bit. While the overarching story is good, the individual character stories don't feel all that detailed. As I've said to a few friends, it feels more like you're cleaning up loose threads, rather than setting out and making a name for yourself. It falls short of what one would expect from a full-blooded RPG, more of a large collection of small side quests with a large single story. It is hard to come to terms with some of the characters, whereas others do have better detailed stories. I felt it was a bit of a struggle to keep invested in a lot of the characters, spent far more time invested in the general story and dragging who I thought was best in combat, rather than any particular personality traits. Should I play this game?  Yes!  The game does enough for you to get invested into the combat mechanics and exploration, while keeping you on your toes with a constantly shifting system of enemies and blood codes. Just...don't expect an RPG of epic proportions. Taken with a grain of salt, this game is solid and definitely worth picking up!			"
Recommended,66.4,"																Code Vein is a decent game and a good action game but as someone who came for the advertised""Souls-Like"" experience I was gravely disappointed. I'm not saying that the game is bad but its just not what I was looking for from it.Story: The story is bland to say the least, bad to say the worst, it's not incoherent or anything its just boring and delivered in the most boring possible manner possible. Vestiges instead of using a quick cutscene to dump the info on you like the info dumps they are just force you to go through multiple loading screens to walk slowly for minutes at a time. Multiple characters just feel unnecessary like Davis or Coco and are there for the sake of being there.Maps: Dull, is the best I can give it, bonkers in the case of an infamous map that, if within the refund timer at the time of hitting it I would have refunded the game right then and there. The maps are unnecessarily labyrinthian and sometimes, outright insane, to the point where the in game map does more to confuse you than help you in some of them. The enemies are severely lacking in variety.Customization: Literally the only reason I could see someone playing this game for, character customization both in combat and in the character itself is quite good, even if a bit overwhelming at the start. Even if learning new gifts is garbage late game seeng as if you don't have a specific kind of resource you would have to destroy your build while you get 1 or 2 abilities. This may be good early game to promote experimentation but late game is unforgivable.Combat: Combat is the thing that broke this game for me, its dull, bosses are unfulfilling and the game isn't hard unless you make it hard for yourself, but why in hell would you do it? Bosses aren't dances of parries, dodges, blocks and counters, they are slugfests against enemies, always too big to be properly observed with almost instant attacks that are ridiculously fast. Even colossal monsters move with the speed of a bullet train, it doesn't help that they have no challenge to them with the exception of the obscene damage they deal. These bosses would be unacceptable in any other souls-like and I don't forgive them here. Normal enemies are constant trough-out the game, there are at most 20 if I'm being extremely generous as most of them are slight variants, they are always countered by the same movement, dodge into them, combat is basically done when you learn that as every single enemy can be countered the same exact way, including bosses.The biggest offence of all is that the enemies don't play by the same rules the player does. They don't seem to get tired and need to stop attacking, their rifles have infinite range while your's don't and they certainly don't do damage on par with you. They can move after they start an attack making them have ridiculous range, all of them have much more range than you which doesn't help. I guess needed this to balance out against your forced magic.They force magic on  you in this game, there is no pure combat option, there is no advantage to a pure combat option, would would be massively gimping yourself, why not just roll pure light power and shotgun enemies in the face with magic, if they aren't playing fair why would you?A promising game, but the lack-luster combat left me severely disappointed, the story doesn't help at all either. I can honestly say I regret buying this game and will most likely never pick it up again.			"
Not Recommended,58.9,"																Game was actually very fun, but is sadly ruined by the final boss. The difficulty spike is incredibly frustrating. The game goes from a easier than usual soul-like to a final boss that is resistant to basically every build, and will one shot you with most of it's attacks in the final phase. In short, it doesn't feel like a challenge. It feels dumb. Really took the air out the game. I was even considering DLC stuff, but after that, I'm down.			"
Not Recommended,29.3,"																Souls-like game from publishers of original Dark Souls series. I fully recommend CODE VEIN to any action game fans out there. I'm surprised at just how much I enjoyed it, in fact.To put it simply, this game does for Dark Souls what God Eater did for Monster Hunter. That is, produces a really anime version of it with a distinct gameplay loop. If you, like myself, saw some gameplay and cringed at the abilities that looked like they belong in an MMO, don't worry about that too much. Most abilities are far more fluid, similar to weapon arts or spells in FromSoftware games.			"
Recommended,111,"																if you don't mind an almost unhealthy amount of anime in your souls-like games, then code vein is definitely up your alley. PROS :The combat is good, the soundtrack is great, you have access to a pretty flexible system to customize your character and playstyle. Visually, the game looks nice overall. the partner you bring with you makes the game feel more alive. Yakumo is a real bro CONS :The level design is a bit meh, and the story is going to be a big hit-or-miss for certain folks (cheesy anime vibes). The fact that there's only 5 weapon types feels a bit restrictive, altough there's quite a few weapons with different movesets in each types. if those things do not bother you (or not too much) then i'd say you should give it a go! the game will run you about 30-35 hours to finish, and there's a few achivements to hunt afterwards for an extra little bit of game time. you can run it again on NG+ to challenge yourself and see the different endings. pro-tip : don't look at the achivements of steam, they do spoil a few things.i'd say it's an 8/10			"

Most of the map is okay but one the map feels like repetitive. It was boring when I see the same structure and the layout of the map. Enemies is hard too kill but if always using backstab there no problem. Some of the bosses are easy to kill. But the hardest one boss I fight is Juzo Mido. I'm really frustrated with fighting with him. I also go True Ending for 29hours... I don't plan to play New Game+. Code Vein’s soundtrack does an amazing job at amplifying the world’s surroundings with it’s harsh tones, and dull mystique that takes the city of Vein from bleak to threatening in a matter of moments.

Recommended,22.1,"																If you like souls like games and anime this game is for you. As a veteran Dark souls player I don't think this game is even close to be difficult as dark souls I and III, but still offers some challenge. Story is good but it could have been a lot better. The soundtrack is amazing, but theres not that many songs. Anyway, I think this game is worth, but don't expect something ultra amazing like dark souls or bloodborne, its fun but its not even close to be a top tier souls like game. This game really shines on char customization. Yeah I already spent a long time on char customization screen, its really good, they gave us a lot of options and keep ading more with patches. I already created a lot of cute anime waifus in this game. For an otacu that should be enought.			"
Recommended,20.9,"																Code Vein is pretty much as advertised - anime Souls with some decent twists on combat. But it had a couple really frustrating flaws that started grating at me until I finally got frustrated and then bored.I'll start with this: there are some interesting enemies and fairly challenging bosses. Combat feels fun, but once you master the basic mechanics most of the abilities you can learn feel superfluous. I tried out some different builds and decided there wasn't much incentive to do anything other than a basic melee guy. If others beg to differ, I'm happy they got enjoyment from the class system, but to me it just felt like there wasn't much to it. I spent the opening hours of the game trying to figure out why all my massive Final Fantasy weapons had such short reach compared to their comically large appearance. When I finally pinned it down, I wanted to smack my own forehead. Regular enemies tend to be pushed back a bit by your attacks. This is pretty standard, but most melee focused action games, including the Dark Souls series which Code Vein draws so much inspiration from, account for this by having the player character take a step forward when you attack in combinations. In defiance of sense, many of the weapon types in Code Vein push enemies away but keep the player character practically stationary while attacking. REVISION: after revisiting, you do move forward a bit, but ofen not enough to outpace the amount that you push enemies back. So you frequently find yourself in this situation where your first attack has pushed the enemy out of range of your second attack while your character just stands still and swings at air, meanwhile you just lost a chunk of stamina and the enemy landed a hit on you while you recovered from the attack that should have landed. Furthermore, standard enemies usually stagger after two consecutive hits, meaning the third hit is pretty much a freebie as long as you have stamina to retreat or evade afterwards. It's hard to believe they would incentivize aggression like this but then purposely create a mechanic that unpredictably punishes you for attacking in combinations, so I have to think that was an oversight. This feels especially bad with large heavy weapons which by their nature force you to pick your shots carefully and have long recovery animations. I ended up choosing weapons based solely on whether they had incidentally included the ability to advance a bit while attacking, or at least had enough range to mitigate this. Exploration is great but level design is bad. Buffs, recovery items, weapons, healing upgrades, weapon upgrade materials, and armor (called blood veils) are absolutely littered throughout the levels, but each individual type of loot is scarce enough that it feels rewarding when you find them. Lots of important items are hidden behind clever little secret paths that require you to be either very observant or tenacious. This was a big highlight of the game for me until the level design fell apart. More on that later. One really great quality of life inclusion in Code Vein is the fact that when you find a weapon pickup (as opposed to weapon drops from enemies) it is already upgraded to a level appropriate to your progression in the game. But the level design...It's clear the makers of Code Vein took inspiration from the looping, winding progression of the Dark Souls series. Walk around in a loop, open a shortcut to the checkpoint, begin again from a pathway branching from the end of said loop. The problem is that they overdid it, especially relative to the paucity of visual feedback to indicate progress. Everywhere you go there are three branching pathways with branching pathways at the end of them. There are a million drops to a furtive path from which you can't return to where you came from. This would be engaging if not for the fact that there is nothing at all to make one part of a level visually distinct from another. It's all the same textures with hardly ever a departure from the uniform look of the level, and the only landmark is your ability to memorize the lay of the land. Fromsoft understands that to make this type of layout shine you have to distinguish different sections of the same level with varying lighting, openness, color, theme and enemy types so that when you open a shortcut to an earlier spot you know exactly where you are. The Cathedral of the deep has a graveyard section, a rooftop section, a swampy pit with giants in it, a great big altar with enemies seated in pews, and a hidden area where you scale the rafters to find a bunch of slug people. Lothric Castle has a creepy garden, a bonfire room full of fancy tapestries and red carpetry, an outdoor section ascending the battlements, a bridge guarded by dragons, a dim lit stairway opening out to a palatial hall of marble and colorful rugs. Etc. etc. Levels that weren't given this kind of detail are the ones that a lot of the player base is lukewarm about, at best. The Demon Ruins of DS3. The Catacombs of DS1. The Forbidden Woods. The Farron Keep. In Code Vein, almost every level sticks to the same color palette, and textures throughout most or all of the level. Every level is Farron Keep... but especially the swamp level that's actually Farron Keep. You even have to light beacons.  I shrugged this off during the early levels, then it started to grate at me during the low visibility swamp area where everything looks exactly the same and your movement speed is nerfed. But where this really became a a sore spot was Code Vein's copy of Anor Londo. This level is a massive labyrinth comprised entirely of two textures: white walkway, and white stone spiral staircase. It's a marathon of identical suspended walkways, dropping down to other suspended walkways, going up three flights of spiral stairs where the walls block your visibility of said walkways (the layout of which is your only tool for identifying the surrounding area) and then dropping down again to complete your disorientation. At one point an NPC actually said to me as we walked past a couple of corpses (which are placed throughout all the levels) that we could use the corpses as landmarks. To me this seemed like an admission by the creators that there is not a single landmark or distinguishing feature to be found. Even the mini map, which shows a little trail of your footsteps, is of little help where there are so many tiers stacked atop each other. At about eighteen hours I have been enjoying myself less as i progress instead of more. I liked it at first but would not recommend it.			"
Recommended,95,"																Code Vein sets up an edgy narrative from the very first minute of gameplay and runs with it through to the ending of the game, truly earning it the title of ""Anime: The Video Game"". I went into Code Vein not knowing what to expect from a ""Souls-Like"" title, as many games are given the same genre tag even though the comparisons are only skin deep. I found the game to be an enjoyable experience overall, even though it felt a little frustrating for me at times (Though not enough for me to get genuinely mad). Code Vein has an interesting overall world and storyline, dotted with fantastic supporting characters which you can actually care about, even if they do very little within the Home Base location.Unfortunately my experience with Code Vein was marred with various frustrations based upon the very minuscule weapon variety. I often times found myself struggling with trying to juggle various different weapons whilst trying to find the one I truly synergized with, until I ultimately resigned myself to using what I had, even though nothing felt quite right. It was only until I'd played through about 80% of the storyline that I finally found a weapon that actually felt like it was truly made for me, which was unfortunate as I was nearly done with the game at that point.Now that I've got that out of the way, on to the pros and cons.Pros:- An unapologetically edgy world which at its core capitalizes upon Vampires being a thing, even going so far as to say that the characters won't die unless their hearts are destroyed. Enemies and characters are often clad in red and black outfits, or some other combination with black being the main color. It's in the same vein as Devil May Cry, which takes edgy aspects and runs with it with no signs of stopping.- An interesting overworld, with great companion and character development told through memories. It's always a nice change when an action game has a segment where you're required to do nothing other than walk, as it allows for the player to take a breather for a moment.- Great supporting characters, which you can come to be genuinely interested in regardless of their small interactions with the general hub.- Fantastic soundtrack. I will say that it's a tad bit disappointing that there's no general overworld music, however the music for each boss is fantastic to the point where I've found myself listening to the OST whilst doing various things around the house.- A large overworld map which allows for hours of exploration. Aside from the enemies which can keep you from progressing into a certain area, the game has several ""puzzle-like"" areas which require you to actually think and search for how to find that single item which you can see but not get to.- Interesting enemy designs. Each area brings its own unique flavor of enemies to the table, with light and dark variations existing which have their own attack elements to make you rethink armor at times.- Amazing character customization. I'm not sure when I last spent an hour or more on character customization, but this game really allows you to have a lot of freedom with its customization. All that's truly missing is beards, even though it's understandable as to why your character can't have one due to story reasons.- Enjoyable boss fights. I've personally never been one to like the Dark Souls franchise of games, as their main cause for difficulty is mechanical limitations, and I also find them much too slow. Whilst this game is mechanically limiting to some extent, the gameplay feels overall much more fluid and enjoyable.- A ton of Skill Trees and skills which aren't locked to a specific class, which allows you to freely play whatever class you'd like and use skills from others, provided you have the correct weapon equipped. After learning a skill or ""Gift"", you can max out its proficiency and use most of them on any class you choose.- Dungeons which feature upgraded versions of most storyline bosses. As you play through the game, you'll find Maps of the Depths, which allow you to fight some of the bosses again, which always have new attacks so as to keep you on your toes.Now, on to the cons.- Some skill trees/playstyles are not viable until after you've beaten the game for the first time. I found myself trying to make a Gunner tree, which unfortunately was a huge flop in comparison to other classes in the game due to a lack of practical skills and buffs which you unfortunately obtain near the end of the game.- An unnecessary delay in combat. There were many times when I would press the B button to dodge, and the dodge would not trigger even though there was time before being hit, and I had stamina. I also felt this whilst in combat as well, where even though my attack animations were done, things would not happen afterwards at times. - Absurd hitboxes. This one really goes without saying, as it's pretty self-explanatory. Being hit when clearly outside of the weapons reach is no bueno.- The game setting up rules and then invalidating them. Early on the game sets up various rules for the player such as how you're unable to fire rifle shots to an unlimited distance, as well as enemy projectiles being unable to go through terrain. As the game progresses, it constantly contradicts itself and goes back upon these with some projectiles going through terrain and enemy shots going on indefinitely. Enemies should be required to abide by the same rules the player is.- Lack of context with various different abilities and stats. During the several hours that I tried to make a Gunner type class, I tried a plethora of different classes and ultimately gave up on them, as the stat differences between Blood Veils and various other things didn't make a difference regardless of what stat they increased.- Bad hitboxes for things such as back attacks and standard swings on some enemies. Truthfully this trend of having to be precise down to the last pixel for backstabbing enemies has to stop, as it feasibly makes no sense whatsoever from a combat perspective. Having to memorize exactly where on the enemies cheeks you have to attack to trigger the backstab animation is absurd.- Parrying in this game leaves a lot to be desired. I'll say that the best experience with parrying I've ever had in a game was with the PS4 release of the 2018 God of War title, whereas you press the button in-time with your enemies attack almost hitting you to parry. It required skill and finesse to constantly do, especially in combat with multiple enemies. Parrying in this game and the timing is dictated by what Blood Veil you wear, which can shorten or lengthen the parry timing depending on which you wear, with none of them being instantaneous and there always being a delay. Final verdict score: 7.5/10. Worth $60? Honestly, for me I'm not sure whether I'd say it's worth $60 as I found myself enjoying the game, but being constantly frustrated not by the bosses, but more so the lack of weaponry which caused me to lose some enjoyment for the game. Definitely worthwhile if it's on sale for $45 or less however.I'm not sure if I'll go back to this game in the future outside of DLC releases, as I've finally found some weapons that I personally enjoy, but that said I did enjoy the game for what it was, and it will always remain as one of the few ""Souls-Like"" games which I've found myself genuinely enjoying, and playing until I'd finished it within a few days span.For this review and others like it, please check out my Steam Curator page if you'd like! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36761101-Miphnificent-Reviews/			"
Recommended,12.3,"																At first Code Vein looked like a cheap souls-like game and I abandoned it for 3 years. How wrong I was back there.. After several hours blood codes and ichor system really took me in. Code Vein did what other souls-like games didn't, it encouraged me in testing new builds, weapons and skills. Not polished and unbalanced game in some places, but it gives several hours of good gameplay and story.			"
Recommended,276.7,"																Code Vein is a fantastic experience that wears it's influences on its sleeve with elements from the souls/born games and more anime inspired action RPGs like the God Eater series without ever letting go of the feeling that Code Vein is its own game bringing it's own personality and improvements to the table.The Good:-Character customization is great and the amount of colors, textures, and accessories ontop of the many hair and eye options gives you plenty of small elements for making your character feel way more personal. They also give you over 30 slots to save presets of your character so you can change how you look whenever you want.-The game has a narrative driven story that showcases your character in its full customization in all cutscenes.-While only having 5 classes of weapons the game does a good job making each weapon you get within the class feel different and fun to use. For example there are many types of 1 handed swords sunset sword will be a quick versatile weapon with combos and attacks focusing on fast shallow cut while the machete is slow and performs like a 1 handed greatsword that shreads your opponent.-There are twenty classes(that I have experienced at close to 40 hours) that all effect your stat scaling and what gear you can wear, and what skills you can unlock. All these classes are themed after your companions and story driven characters so the added lore ties add more worth to them IMO. Some skills within your classes are locked even after  unlocking said classes till you discover memories scattered throughout the games world or unlocked in story events.-Skills add a new flavor to the souls like formula, they can range from active attacks or spells which are visually fun to watch and fit well within the default combos, to passives that buff stats or add elemental effects, buffs that cause poison, traps to lure mobs into, and many more. This really shines when you master a skill because it allows you to use it with any class giving you customization in your playstyle. Mastering a skills is easy you simply need to gain experience while having them equiped the amount will vary depending on the skill or by using your Haze(exp) and items called MJ(#) to auto master them.-Companions in this game are a good upgrade from many other games of this genre, they will remind you if head down new paths or if you are backtracking a lot, they can notify you of hazards or items you may have missed, and each one has it's own personality and varied dialogue lines. A welcome surprise is they are competent fighters almost a little too strong at certain points and don't need to be babysat like in many other games. All teamates(and yourself) also come with a skill that pulls from their own HP pool to revive you if you were to fall in battle this is a nice change for people who are struggling with areas or bosses. But to add to this AI teamates are completely optional if you want a harder solo experience you can simply not use them (minus the first ""tutorial"" boss).-The map is a great addition, your mistle point map sections of the map, so do other mapping interactables and key mobs. The game also tracks your steps and leaves them on the map to show where you have and have not been, items you have seen show up on the map and from what it appears, when you fully map the area items you have missed will show up on the map, making it less of a chore if you missed a single item and cannot find it.-Multiplayer is a big upgrade from the souls series, it takes no items, you can do it from the very first area, both players get drops from mobs, and the netcode is good. There is some issues that I will list in the next sectionThe mixed bag:-The story/theme/characters are a personal preference that may put some people off. The game is very narrative-driven but it is filled with anime tropes. Characters do fill many anime inspired archetypes and so do many themes and situations in the game. That being said The story is fun and interesting, the world building is solid and the characters feel like proper people in the bleek world they reside in. This is reinforced in the games narritive by having your character collect memories of teamates and key NPC's which takes you into their past to fill inblanls of the world and it's characters and I feel is a more personal way to exposition dump on the player.-Leveling and stats in this game work quite differently from other souls games and to some might feel shallow especially at the beginning of the game. Primarily leveling mostly just raises your hp and stamina. Your class/armor/passives will be what determine your stats and works with a scaling system to adjust your various types of damage and cores stats while following the letter rating system some might be familiar with. This is both basic in theory but can still be confusing for those trying to be specific or min max moreover when the player is at first few hours when you only have a handful of classes to pick from and a few pieces or armor to adjust the scaling.-Difficulty is also a mixed bag, the game can feel easy at times expecially in multiplayer with your AI teamates. But still have random spikes in difficulty. These are normally a skill/gear checks that make you take into account the weaknesses of yourself and the creature you are trying to fight if you cannot win on your skill alone. But those looking for an extreme challenge might not find it here- Ichor (Mana/mp/magic) in this game is a little different, it does not replenish on it's own or over time. Mage classes get up to about the mid 30's and some fighter classes only start with 10. Most skills and some weapon heavy attacks take between 3-10 Ichor to use and rifles take it to shoot bullets. To replinish it you can rest at the mistle, use items, attack enemies, or backstab enemies. Backstabbing adds 2 Ichor to your max until you reset the area and attacking mobs refills your Ichor quickly this makes it better for using skills in battle but can feel more restrictive for players that like to play defensively or from range.The bad:-Character customization while having many options for accessories and features has almost 0 control over your characters build. There is no adjustment on any body feature like height, bust, muscle mass, etc. The game has a single slider that I'm just going to call a thickness slider and just makes you thinner or Thicker all around but the effect isn't even that vast. This is for the males and the female characters.-While many weapons feel quite different there are still plenty similar weapons and with only 5 groups you do wish there was more by the end game.-One of the levels drags on much longer than any other and while it loops well and has many shortcuts it overstays it welcome and easily takes a few hours to get through.-While the story is interesting there are times after bosses where the exposition dump goes a little too far and you will be in back to back cutscenes that are only broken up by the memory sequences which are cutscenes you can walk slowly in. This is brought to life more if you are playing multiplayer with a friend because your friend will be waiting for your story dumps to finish so you can clear his level  and then wait for him to finish the cutscenes before heading to the next area.Overall this is a very fun game with an interesting story and good multiplayer that is well worth picking up. But don't rush in expecting Code Vein to be darksouls with an anime coat of paint. 8.75/10			"
Recommended,69.9,"																The great thing about this game is not the gameplay, but its story that you will uncover from the vestiges that you collect in your journey to save your fellow Revenants. Underneath all the anime tiddies in the game, you will find a story that's so gripping, it will push you to explore each of your companion's past which in turn will make you more invested in the game's lore. From Louis' helplessness to Cruz's suffering, to the familial bonds between Mia and Nicola. Everything about this game's story makes it all worth it for me.The only downside for me in the game is it's gameplay. On one hand, there are plenty of varieties to the bosses, each with their own unique movesets. On the other, the mobs you encounter in the early game will just be recycled throughout the game. In some cases, those same mob will be reskinned and added with one or two new moves just to say that they are good as new. The lack of variety in between bosses just makes each minor mob encounter boring and tedious to do. This is even more so when you die from traps like pitfalls and extending tentacle wall spikes.I did encounter some bugs in the game like elevators not moving and mobs getting stuck to the terrain. These things  however can easily be solved either just by returning to a mistle or exiting the game. Other than that,  I truly enjoyed the journey I had in finishing the game. Even though the combat can be tiring sometimes, I still pushed on to see and discover more of this game's story because the world that they created really intrigued me. Besides, I really preferred this kind of story telling compared to Dark souls where you need to read each of the item's description, read the Dark souls wiki, while also watching lore videos in Youtube just to get a sense on what's going on in the story. I don't mind doing it once when Darks souls was first released. Doing it two more times after that just makes it feel like I'm researching for a thesis paper just to get the complete story of the whole series.Anyways, all in all I would give this game an 8.5/10. The whole story is great especially when you complete all the vestiges that you can find in the game. The game could've been better if only there were more varieties to the enemy types to encounter. If you're looking for a game with a great story without being stressed out about combat, then this is the one you're looking for. If you're looking for a hardcore challenge to sate your masochistic desires, then this is not the game you're looking for. You're better off buying the Dark souls series.			"

When we finally got around to playing it we found out that when playing co-op only the host is able to pick up items making it so the non-host has to play through all the content over again just to get their items.

Not Recommended,124.8,"																In Code Vein you play as a Revenant (may as well say vampire in a sense) in a post apocalyptic world. The game is inspired by the Soul games however at the same time, being rather unique. You will learn new Blood Codes aka (classes) as you progress the game, meet companions who you can partner up (Which is optional!) Then carving your very own ending in the game.PROS- Customization is amazing, however the clothing options are rather limited (still spent an hour there tho)- Mastering skills in Blood Codes allows you to use the skill for any Blood Code, allows for wide skill customization and interesting builds.- Entire game can be played in Co-op, with the only issue being you can't use mistles in MP.- Stories & Memories as you Progress & Find keeps you engaged in the world of Code Vein. - The game doesn't feel grindy at all, which is rare for a Bandai title. - Blood Veils (armor) don't just serve as a defense & stat booster. It will also effect ur parry/charge & drain attacks.- The game has 4 endings, replayability is encouraged to obtain all Blood Codes available. - You leave white dots as you run around on ur map so you know if u have been on that path or not, helps for rather big maps. - I didn't mind dying to  Invading Executioner  CONS- Cathedral - No Ufotable Animation shown in an anime format like it had showed in the Trailer.- You may only join people in the same Steam Download region for you, so this can make co-op rather limited like it was in God Eater 3.- Sudden FPS drops in certain boss fights in MP despite dealing with those same fights in SP without issue.- NG+ Enhance.... Has a rather high difficulty spike compared to normal mode. Beware if you decide to do Enhance.OverallHonestly? Absolutely love the game and how the whole game came together. This is deffo one of the better Bandai Namco related titles in the recent years. I'm looking forward to see what they have planned for DLC's. As IO says...  Everyone, Everywhere, is thirsty. 			"

Recommended,38.8,"																After beating the game and then beating it again on NG+ on enhanced difficulty I think the game is quite good aside from some gripes I have with NG+ enhanced difficulty. This game is pretty much anime Dark Souls. Pretty good character customization that can (mostly, aside from sex or physique and a few others) be changed at any time to keep your fashion up to date with whatever build you might be trying out. Gameplay is very souls-like. An emphasis on dodging to avoid damage as usual, though you can create a build centered around blocking with some of the magic called ""Gifts"" that you can unlock. Blood Codes are basically your class and determine your stats such as your Dexterity, Strength, Vitality and so on. Blood Codes can also be unlocked and there are a large variety of them. Each Blood Code has a set of Gifts that can be unlocked, and most of these Gifts can be ""Inherited"" or ""Mastered"" to be able to use them universally in other Blood Codes. Due to the abundance of Gifts a caster build can be viable and quite fun, or you can choose to play a support role, or use Gifts that give you special melee or Bayonet gun attacks or a mix between. Gifts consume ""Ichor"" which you can generate by attacking enemies in melee.I actually dug the story a bit. There are a few different endings (4 I believe) that you can get. Items called ""Vestiges"" can be picked up to both restore memories of the different characters you encounter and unlock Gifts within different Blood Codes. These Vestiges put you within memories that give a backstory or otherwise more context to the position many of the characters find themselves in.Weapon variety is pretty decent. There are 5 main weapon types: One-handed swords, Two-handed swords, Spears/Halberds, Two-Handed Hammers/Axes and Bayonets. One-handed swords being your typical broadsword from Dark Souls with R1 spam capabilities. Two-handed swords are absolutely massive and generally do a large amount of damage but are slow. Spears/Halberds have lots of range, with halberds being able to do large sweeps and spears doing thrusting attacks. Two-Handed hammers being similar to two-handed sword except tend to do crushing damage and axes do more slash. Bayonets are an interesting weapon set that have ranged capability as well as melee. They are very quick like one-handed swords but generally seem to have less crowd control. Ranged attacks consume Ichor an can come in forms of shotguns, rifles, or even flamethrowers. Many of these weapons may look similar but have their own idiosyncrasies, particularly with their heavy and charged heavy attacks.Enemies and Bosses are pretty alright. Enemies don't vary too much but are just enough to keep navigating through levels from getting boring. Some enemies end up being reskins of others but with more HP or new sets of moves. Most of the enemies in the game have very large sweeping attacks that can be annoying at times especially when dodging or fighting groups. Bosses for the most part seemed interesting and cool. Of course after enough deaths you'll probably get the hang of most difficult encounters, but some bosses have very quick attacks or attacks with a less noticeable telegraph. Occasionally this can translate into feeling a bit unfair or being nearly impossible to react to. Some bosses that have some what transparent magical or elemental attacks can be difficult as the wind up of these moves can be hard to see against the surrounding area. For one boss, I didn't even realize there was a pattern to some of these attacks until NG+ because I couldn't see them and they didn't do enough damage to finish me off in the first playthrough. NG+ enhanced difficulty is probably my biggest gripe with the game. For context I played a caster build in my second playthrough so I was a bit squishier than my 2H sword wielding character in my first playthrough. Enemy damage seemed to be scaled up quite a bit. Regular enemies hit harder but weren't too bad, but bosses were particularly harder. I found it more and more noticeable in boss encounters that many of them had attacks that would one-shot me. Maybe it was my build but the farther in the game that I got the worse it became. Eventually, I reached a boss where every attack they did would take me from full HP to none except for a small number of moves I could probably count on my hand. I did end up over the hump but it was not an enjoyable experience. If you enjoy that kind of challenge, go for it, but to me it just reduces the viability of squishier builds.			"
Not Recommended,12.7,"																This game is like Dark Souls on a tab of acid in an anime convention. Super addictive game play, insane story line, and incredible voice acting on great characters. Bandai Namco packed in a ton of emotion into this game, but sadly the player base is fading rapidly. This game is mostly fun when you are actually able to progress, and usually that means having help from other people, but since there are much less people, it's very hard to progress through the story line smoothly.Otherwise, this game is a good example of great story telling and great graphics at the very beginning of the RTX stages. Runs incredibly well, and the characters feel so alive. 100% would recommend playing at least once.			"

Mostly the miasma tunnels between levels.[Boobs] - Amazing/All shapes and sizes[Camel toe] - Murasame (Weapons shop) wins. I can't stop staring at it.[Character design] - Top notch character creation, I spent an hour making my waifu. Animation was credited to Ufotable, the team that does Demon Slayer anime.If you want more of this game and liked the story, it's set in pre-God Eater world. You can catch more from anime and those games as well. Those are also handiwork of Ufotable. The anime shows how the world collapsed by episode 12 and the ""horror"" that almost got past the blood mist is Dyaus Pita. While God Eater is a concept of ""Man becoming God"", Code Vein is ""God becoming Man"". You'll get that reference if you watch the show.As much as I would love a New-Type weapon, the characters themselves are New-Type weapons, able to devour enemies for ammo/mana. And those weapons don't exist yet in this setting.			"

Recommended,56.7,"																   Let me just say I am an extremely casual player. I play games because they are fun not because I am good at them. That being said I have loved parts of Code Vein but struggled to enjoy the game.    Story wise (dont worry I will leave out spoilers), it is at best okay. It isn't amazing. Sadly it is extremely linear thus any sort of search for lore you will come up lacking. All the lore is a linear path outside of vestiges which are memory fragments of characters you meet.   Character development doesn't really exist at all. There is a point where you delve into your memories and find out things but outside of that you don't get to grow at all and the characters that surround you hardly have any depth.    Enemy diversity lacks severely. It is almost the same as BOTW (Zelda Breath of the Wild where you see almost every single enemy in the game in the first 3 areas. Even bosses get used as normal enemies with their health and attack patterns halved and such. But outside of that there is no real diversity.    Progression in the game is actually awful. 90% of the items you find in nooks and crannies in the world don't actually help you. If you want to big brain you have the camo cloaks that make you hard to detect and items to make you not as loud but outside of those items, vestiges, and anything that directly affects combat that isnt an element changer, nothing else matters. Leveling in the game is actually bad for you believe it or not. Mastery a blood code which gives access to using gifts/abilities outside of that blood code will be restricted to the level you are. So if you rush ahead with your level and hit level 100 in the 5th area, sorry but you wont even see a mark on the mastery bar. You will have to wait till the very end of the game till enemies give enough mastery to leave a mark. Best advice if you wish to maximize level is to get about 10 ish levels per area. Although you can purchase mastery with awakening materials, those materials are rare so use them sparingly and are the most valuable item in the game outside of vestiges. Personally I find punishing players for wanting a boost a small boost in stats an awful idea but hey who said they were making games for fun.    Aside from the garbage enemy diversity, weapon diversity also lacks sadly. There is only 2 combo types for each weapon type. Short Sword, Bayonette (rifle), Polearm (just halberds), Hammer, Axe, and Great Sword. That is 12 different combo styles. People may add heavy attacks and alternate attacks are a thing but almost all of them are way too slow to come out, are not beneficial at all, and dangerous to use since you will be standing still for way too long making yourself into the biggest ""kick me"" target the school bully has ever seen.    Scaling in this game feels awkward and clunky which also pairs up with what i said before about bosses becoming normal enemies. It seems all enemies have the same health bars but just have different ranges of armor? Don't quote me on this it just feels like that. You see the same enemies at the start of the game as you do in the end of the game and for some reason you still take them down just as easily. I don't know but I have tried to test it and see but I have no conclusive answer outside of enemy scaling feels clunky and awkward as you progress.    Hit boxes and tracking. Oh boy here we go. I had a huge issue with the tracking in this game. I've played dark sou;s and the tracking in that game felt fine but for some reason the tracking in Code Vein feels like a suggestion. After some rolls i would be attack 180 degrees away from the target yet the room would be empty for us. On top of that, my attacks slide of enemies and bosses more often than i'd be okay with and enemies do the same. It is extremely awkward when your special anime slam attack just slide around their hit box and lands next to the monster you are fighting, only for their sweeping crush attack to move you instead of close lining your face. It happens quite a bit actually and I cannot say I am happy playing with that issue.    Ability/Gift progression felt pretty bad. I have been playing this game with a friend and we both noticed this. All the Gifts/abilities you get for caster you dont get till the end of the game and most of them become useless. Like why even bother giving me a spell that removes all debuffs if the last area doesn't have an enemy that procs debuffs. Extremely stupid and terrible design. Code Vein isn't really designed for replay ability in the sense of new game+ and even the DLCs are shockingly lacking in any sort of content.    Overall this isn't a 60 dollar game. The DLCs are not worth a penny and are actually lying about the new weapons. you can get the same weapons with the same affects if you just find the materials, rebuy the weapon and put it together, no joke the DLCs give nothing. Don't waste you money please. I'd say at most this game is $35-$40 but no more than $40. I really tried to enjoy this game but sadly I had to stick to the truth, I liked it because I had fun with the friend i played it with. Nothing more than that. The clothing clipping was an added gripe but I don't think people care because it happens all the time, just wish i didn't see it with characters that weren't the one i made. Go play any other souls type game unless you are really invested on the anime stuff. This is an opinion after all not a way of life.			"
Not Recommended,11.6,"																This game has its own uniqueness in various ways, like having much more details in accessory customization rather than facial and physical appearance. With its anime aesthetic Code Vein has its own charm in terms of graphics, and story wise, I can say that its pretty good. Combat is quite similar to god eater (and soundtrack too) and has a lot more to it than you'd expect, players can have different variations of play style and different builds that can be created. So far this game is what I expected it to be.			"
Recommended,11.4,"																The thoughts™️+STUPIDLY good character customization, specifically regarding accessories, hair, eyes, and other miscellaneous stuff.+You basically have a customizable moveset that applies to all weapons+Can change classes on the fly+Music, when it's good, is absolutely amazing+You get a permanent NPC follower that will revive you if you die+Lots of bonus content+All of the main characters are mostly likeable (Yakumo is bae <3 <3)+Great ability system-Character creator leaves a lot to be desired in terms of general body options. The first NPC you see has a bigger chest than is possible in the editor.-There are like, 7 outfits per gender and they all get covered up by a cape.-There are... effectively only five weapons categories with very slight differences between each variant.-Story is absolutely awful until the very last stretch of the game where it actually starts bringing up interesting plot points (One of which is never resolved, I might add)-The game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard. It's not even comparable to dark souls. Most bosses can and WILL one-shot you.-NPC followers are nice, but the game is BALANCED around them constantly reviving you. Going it alone is optional but nearly impossible. And sometimes they just stand there and watch you die even when their revive is fully recharged.-Despite the game having a big soundtrack there are only really three songs you're liable to hear for most of the game.-Best ending is locked behind Dark Souls sidequest logic. I missed it by ONE objective because I killed a boss before picking up some items in the area.-Most fights will either be long, drawn-out and dodgy, or will end in 20 seconds when either you die in one hit or you dish out enough damage to kill a boss in a few.-Character building is nonexistant. Each class has a predefined role and you can't manually change stats, so no minmaxing.Overall: 6.5/10. If you want anime souls, this is it, but it's far from a better game.			"
Not Recommended,3.6,"																Code Vein is not Dark Souls. It lacks the polished combat and stellar world design of the legendary franchise. However, it makes up for these things with its brilliant character customization, a deep narrative with twists and turns, and skills and abilities that challenge the player to defeat enemies in a way they never would have thought of before. Code Vein is a stylish JRPG that just falls short in a few areas. Its inspirations are clearly worn on its sleeve, but it brings enough to the table to stand out on its own. If you're a soulslike fan, Code Vein should be played.PROS:✓ In-depth character customization✓ Memorable story✓ Gorgeous anime art✓ Blood Codes and their distinct Gifts offer plenty of customization and flexibility✓ Interesting level design encourages exploration✓ Approachable Souls-like with helpful tutorials✓ Ease of travel between locationsCONS:- Recycled enemies- Enemies are too static and don’t provide meaningful challenge- Clunky combat- The environmental visual design is meh- Forgettable boss fights			"

Recommended,0.9,"																It took my friend and I a few years to beat Code Vein because we kept taking a lot of breaks. If you are into Dark Souls like games, I definitely recommend it. It's pretty challenging and the story is enjoyable. If you're like me who sucks at Dark Souls like games...yeah expect it to take a while to get through some of the fights. Regardless enjoyable.			"
Recommended,20.2,"																Pros:• Character Customisation is awesome• Story at the start was a bit too anime but It grew on me and developed to be really quite good• Challenging for Sure, but Companions carry a little too much at the start• Graphics are good, but what is better is the stellar performance & consistency even at 240fps• Soundtrack is Pog, really Pog• It's anime without being way too anime• Very good character development, but sometimes hard to keep track of all the names.• Plenty of lore if you want that, text/cutscenes/fragments can be skipped if you dont want to though. choice is always good• Combat felt simple near the start of the game but got much better after a couple hours with abilities, different weapons etc and getting used to the gameMeh's:• Female ""Parts"" are a bit.... inflated• Not Many Starting Clothing Items to Pick from, but some are good anyway and you can fine-tune them• Blood Veils (aka Armour) can't be manually coloured, and only offer ~3 max colours per each one. Hope this gets changed!• Nicola is a boy... ???• Map environments could be a bit more broad and pretty but are already quite good. Will probably get more in DLC anywayCons:• Cathedral Section is by far the worst place, it's bland, maze-like, boring and empty whilst being one of the longest sections of the game :(Would Definitely Recommend even if you don't like anime that much ( like me :D )			"
Recommended,57.1,"																I think this would of been a great game, if half the development team wasn't working on boob physics.Joking aside, I would describe this game as not great, not terrible. It certainly has its moments and if you're an anime + dark souls fan, I think you'll like it. Ultimately, it wasn't for me. The positives:    Art and design: beautiful character models, weapons, character customization    Good idea to show your footsteps in the mini-map, I wish more games did thisThe negatives:    The level design is ultimately boring. Without spoilers, you have ruined cities, deserts, fire and ice. That's pretty much it. You have a limited colour palette through the entire game, I imagine this was a conscious choice by the level designers to create a certain ambience, but I didn't care for it. It was depressing and boring.    The blood code AKA class system. You unlock blood codes throughout the game. Some are not obvious, you have to talk to NPCs without any indication you should talk to them. You then unlock skills within these blood codes. It's unclear when you will find certain items to unlock these skills. Then you have to level the skills themselves inside the blood codes to 'master' them so you can use the skills whenever you want, given you meet the weapon requirements. This all felt very convoluted - there are repeating codes (like Power Up), useless codes that I can't imagine anyone using. Navigating through these different codes and seeing which ones you have levelled up was incredibly annoying. What stats do what is also unclear unless you do some googling. Ichor, the ""Mana"" of the game. This resource feels severely limited unless you optimise your build for it or use the drain attacks of the game. The drain attacks restore Ichor instead of your Hit Points... A game where you're a VAMPIRE. Ok, I guess. The story. Rather, how it's told. Unlocking skills from blood codes requires gathering memory stones. Each memory stone is you being teleported to a colourless level and being spoon fed dialogue from a character you don't really care about. One. Sentence. At. A. Time. You can skip the entire cut scene, but there is no option for being teleported to the level in the first place. Just let me get my skill, please.The main story was pretty boring. I didn't find any of the characters memorable or wanting to root for them. Just meh.The PC port. As console ports go, this wasn't too bad. But you can instantly tell this game was made for playing with a controller. As I'm used to playing with M&KB, the gameplay was frustrating. The keyboard layout is not great, also navigating through menus is not intuitive at all. Again, this was clearly made for console.The expansions. For their price, they're not worth it. If you buy this, wait for deep discount or skip them altogether. They are basically one small level (called Depth), you can get some items from them and a new boss, that's it.			"
Recommended,69,"																A filthy casual like me who never tried any souls game before can play this gameOne of the few games that I bought full price and I'm having a blastA huge amount of options in character creation (and u can change anytime in game)Souls game combat but with the addition of blood codes and gifts which allow many playstylesDrain from parry/back attack is satisfyingSurprisingly amazing soundtracks (amber journey ;_;) but sometimes feel out of place in a few scenesGood story (at least for me).

Recommended,18.5,"																A very solid Anime-Style Souls-like.Combat feels quite impactful and has the right amount of ""sluggishness"" to it. Equipment-options are exceedingly limited (3 Slots - 2 for Weapons and 1 for your Blood Veil), but there is a wide variety of weapons that do set themselves apart from one another. Particularly some boss weapons with elemental effects feel very unique.While weapon movesets are VERY basic, the option to combine gifts and passives from various classes (that also differ wildly) ensures that you have a lot of different playstyles at your disposal and you can create a class that wreaks havoc however you see fit. Be it a Greatsword-wielding berserker, an elemental caster or a ranged ichor cannon.The lore is fairly interesting and the world-building is well done. In terms of the overall story - it is serviceable but definitely nothing to write home about.If you've played some Dark Souls or Nioh, the standard difficulty is probably not going to be very challenging for you. The addition of a constant companion that can not only draw aggro, but also revive you, paired with the generous i-frames  and mostly heavily telegraphed moves makes it very easy to plough through most bosses.Regardless of this, Code Vein stands as an above average souls-like and is definitely worth your time.

Recommended,59.8,"																5/10 — Not all bad, but not good.Some Context: I used min-maxed melee greatswords with the starting Fighter blood code/class for the entirety of the game, which seems to be heavily pushed on you as it seems like easily one of the best options, if not the best, and probably what most of the game was balanced around, and despite that, it was still a pretty bad experience. Greatswords in Code Vein are still somewhat quick, but get significantly more damage than other weapons, and I was able to maintain ""Normal"" weight without sacrifices.What brought my rating down so much:• Big issues with combat/fight design, such as:→ Bosses spamming attacks with little-to-no cooldown, while simultaneously hitting like a truck, and rarely giving you safe time to heal.→ Some boss instant attacks with no telegraph or bad telegraphs, and sometimes these are extreme damage insta-kills. I've also seen this happen in the middle of a different animation.→ Recovery time after attacking takes longer than it feels like it should, preventing you from dodging attacks occasionally.→ Targeting enemies is inconsistent. Even if you're not locked on, it still tries to home-in on an enemy when you initiate an attack, and this may completely ruin your attack, encounter plans, and dwindle resources at no fault of your own, by either choosing the wrong target, throwing off your direction, or making your attack go between targets instead of at one. Locking onto targets doesn't always choose the correct target based on camera angle & distance.→ Parry timings seem too jank to be worth using, especially in combination with questionable enemy telegraphs.→ Backstabs frequently fail to work.• I fully completed everything, but there were still ~6 achievements leftover, asking for either online play or two more full playthroughs for other endings, which would probably take 20+ hours with my same build in NG+. You could use this opportunity to try different builds/playstyles, but I didn't enjoy it enough, and the viability of other builds seemed questionable.• On rare occasion, the game randomly crashes for no discernible reason. It's always during long sessions for me, and without warning. This undoes all progress since you've last rested at a checkpoint, which may or may not be a lot. FYI That's pretty much the only time the game saves.• Area design becomes really bad in some places, and the lackluster map may not actually help you find your way whatsoever in some cases.• No progress indicators for things like area loot, vestiges, blood codes, or overall file progress.• There's no way to re-watch some ""playable"" story scenes that may be skipped by pressing the pause button once. If this happens to you during vestiges, you can probably Alt+F4 out of the game if your save was recent.• NPC Side-Quest stuff is almost all lame.• Story is mostly generic, so don't expect anything too special....I enjoyed some of the visual & sound design. It feels like half of the game's content designers knew what they were doing, and the other half really didn't.			"
Not Recommended,5.4,"																While the gameplay is fun and the character creation is pretty, CODE VEIN is, and I hate to use Dark Souls as comparisons normally, LITERALLY Anime Dark Souls.. The downside is that the level design seems to be aimless mazes rather than having any sort of direction, like Dark Souls has. This results in you running around lost for hours before you just so happen to stumble upon where to go. This is not fun.. it's not fun to look at, it's not fun to wade through. Maybe I'll change my mind as I keep progressing, but so far the level design is is so lackluster it's dragging the rest of the game down with it. You'll be seeing glowy veins for quite a while before finally arriving at the Anor Londo clone.. Except that this Anor Londo clone is terrible compared to actual Anor Londo. While in Anor Londo, the path was set for you, and you only had to figure out how to get there, This game literally just twists and turns with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ set of stairs as the last set of stairs.. Fall off here and.. aren't I just back where I started? Let me check the map... WHAT? 10% This level is HUGE.. and not in a good way.. It's huge, but it all looks the exact same with washed out color and endless staircases EVERYWHERE. The enemies aren't even difficult compared to what I gotta look at while fighting them. If you can get over this, or use a guide, the rest of the game has many mechanics and features that I really do enjoy. Combat is fun, if not a little weird.. Hits don't really feel like they connect unless you're using a heavy weapon, but dancing around enemies smacking them with a hammer is so fun I kinda just wanna keep doing it. So why do I recommend this game if I have so many bad things to say? It feels like Dark Souls, but you can go really far with the character customization.. And I'm into that. It was one of the few things I wish Dark Souls did better. The game is definitely worth a shot, ESPECIALLY if you can get it on sale. I don't think I could justify spending $60 on this, but the 8$ I spent made this buy pretty spectacular. I will end up beating it, and if anything changes in my time from now til then, maybe I'll adjust this review.			"

Not Recommended,1.5,"																Now that I have all achievements unlocked I think it's a good time to finally leave my review.So i'll be honest with you, I've been insanely hyped for this game ever since it was first revealed back in uhh, 2017 I believe. Massively disappointed about the 1 year delay, but it seems like it was worth it in the long run. The game has seriously exceeded my expectations while still falling short in some places. If I had to assign it a numerical score, I'd say it's about an 8.5/10.As many of you are already aware, Code Vein has an outstanding character creation tool. This sort of stuff really isn't my forte, but I still had a lot of fun with it and came up with a character design that I was truly pleased with.The story in Code Vein, while nothing record breaking, was quite good. The first half was a bit slow and it was your generic post-apocalyptic storyline, but around the time you reach the optional memory sequence in the Cathedral it all starts picking up speed. I ended up getting really attached to some of the characters by the end of the game, and that's not normally the case with souls-like games. I think a lot of it is because of the excellent way backstories are told through memory sequences found in vestiges. It was nice to actually be rewarded with more story content as a reward for fully exploring and clearing zones.As is normal for big budget Japanese games, the music was phenomenal. Granted you mostly only hear the tracks during memory sequences and during big boss battles. But when you do hear it, it's superb. Most of the time when you're exploring you just hear ambient noise such as wind blowing or whatever is relevant to the zone you're in.World design was pretty great. It starts off kind of weak with your most generic ruined post-apocalyptic city, but it doesn't stay that way for long. By the time you reach the Cathedral (4th zone), the levels start getting way more unique. The snowy zone was among my favorites, even if it was full of death traps.The combat isn't nearly as tight as other souls-likes and feels a little floaty. But once you play for a bit and master it you won't notice anymore. Depending on how creative you are, you can create some absurdly overpowered builds. I've been a 2H sword build that's built around you being stealthed at all times and running with MASSIVE damage buffs. With it you can stand in front of a group of enemies and decimate them one at a time without ever being seen. I'm not a fan of this type of playstyle but it's super neat that you have the freedom to do such a thing. Playing a poleaxe build has been my favorite so far, but sometimes I fall back on my trusty 2H sword build because of the ridiculous stagger power it has.Performance is mostly good. In my 95-ish hour playthrough I never experienced any crashes or anything. I played on a 4790k/R9 Fury @ 1440p using High/Highest settings and maintained around 70-80 FPS the whole time. The only real performance dips I experience were in the hallways transitioning between zones and whenever a co-op summon would arrive in your world it would occasionally lock up for a second. The performance stutters were basically non-existent when playing in offline mode so it must have something to do with the online play.Overall this is one of my favorite games I've ever played. Not the greatest game I've ever played, but definitely among my favorites. It has some flaws and some QoL issues that might bother me but are fine for other people. None of them ever got in my way of enjoying Code Vein. It's a solid game and I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in the souls-like genre and are also fans of anime influenced games. PS: Io is trash and Mia is the true best girl of the game. Fight me.			"
Not Recommended,1.1,"																""It's not about the destination. It's the journey.""A game I viewed with slightly underwhelming expectations, only to be proven wrong in the PS4 invite-closed beta and public demo. A game, which, once the full product was released, surpassed my expectations again with a heartfelt, effort-and-love-filled package from the developers into a game that feels and stands out to be far more than what people view to be a mere ""Souls-like."" Pros:+ Character customization: the most accessible yet versatile, time-consuming and fun I've played with. This alone is hours worth of content.+ Soundtrack goes all out; talented cast of choir and orchestra+ Artstyle is beautiful. Lots of details are added to add to each location's aesthetic in a disturbingly pleasing way.+ Gameplay is very smooth; easier than the other Souls but the controls feel nice and the game itself still provides a worthy challenge.+ Exploration is highly rewarded+ Character and enemy designs are memorable+ Surprisingly excellent story with multiple endings.+ Well-optimized PC port+ Blood Code and Gifts system adds and encourages a lot of variety and change in gameplay styles + Plenty of content overall, alongside a New Game++ Voice acting was great!+ Accessible for players of all skill levels: partners guide people new to the Souls-like genre whilst game gives you an option to traverse alone for veterans looking for a greater challenge.+ Good keyboard/mouse support; Souls games really struggled with this. Cons:- Game starts off a little too easy. - A few minor bugs here and there, alongside stuttering, nothing game breaking but bad enough for some to be noted ASAP. Most noticeably; ladder magnetic hitbox issue, overly long partner rez cooldown hitstun-cancellation, occasional frameskips- Cathedral's very map design is overly annoying to navigate. Common community issue- Co-op region matchmaking issues are there. Minus a few issues with the game, I was overall content with the amount of content, love and effort put into the game by the developers, especially in 2019. Other AAA developers no longer have an excuse to release shoddy, mediocre, unfinished cash grabs. Thank you Namco, for a fresh breath of air and a satisfying, heartfelt experience.10/10 - A true gem of a game that I'll never get to experience in the future.			"

Recommended,31.4,"																**Introduction:**From the moment I delved into this game, it bore a striking resemblance to Devil May Cry, at least in terms of its premise. My initial motivation for acquiring it was the hope of capturing some of the essence of the Souls series, albeit in a more accessible form. While it doesn't serve as a mere clone, it incorporates fundamental elements reminiscent of the Souls games. Within its world, you'll discover a sanctuary filled with rooms, enigmatic characters seeking refuge, and the gradual unveiling of companions along your journey. Although the cutscenes may not align with my personal preferences, they remain an integral part of the experience.**Key Points:****1. Souls-Like Essence with a Unique Flavor:** This game echoes the essence of the Souls series while infusing its own distinctive character. It offers a familiar sense of exploration, sheltering characters, and the discovery of companions, akin to the Souls games. However, it stands as a unique entity rather than a mere replication.**2. Cooperative Gameplay Dynamics:** The inclusion of an AI companion adds an intriguing dimension to gameplay. This companion proves invaluable when facing hordes of foes and hastening mission completion.**3. Genshin Impact Influence with Drawbacks:** Character-wise, the game draws parallels with Genshin Impact. Unfortunately, it occasionally accentuates exaggerated female body proportions, which may prove off-putting for some players.**4. Value for Money:** Acquired during a sale, this game doesn't feel like a financial misstep. Most levels or chapters feature narrow, maze-like pathways where death lurks at every turn. Persistence is key, as you'll find yourself retracing your steps repeatedly to clear zones and bypass obstructions.**Conclusion:**In conclusion, this game intertwines familiar Souls-like elements with its own unique identity, offering an engaging and accessible experience. While it may bear a resemblance to Devil May Cry in its premise, it possesses its own distinct charm. The inclusion of an AI companion enhances the cooperative dynamics of gameplay, but the character design, reminiscent of Genshin Impact with exaggerated proportions, may not appeal to everyone. Acquired during a sale, this title offers value for your investment, but be prepared for labyrinthine level design and a requirement for a good sense of direction to navigate successfully.			"

Recommended,41.7,"																Good Graphics. Plays well. Story is typical over the top anime style.Coop works quite well and quickly.One big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem though. The friend I was playing the game with had a PC crash and when he loaded up the game again his save was gone.The save in the steam cloud was also corrupted so he lost everything.After some research apparently if the game crashes mid auto save it will corrupt the save. Auto saving is also the only way to save in this game. So there is no way to avoid this if your game crashes...This is a serious problem that needs to be fixed...Edit: I feel like this needs a little bit more detail.Unlike Dark Souls you can not just save quit to the menu, you can't manually save.The game auto saves constantly. Which should be good. But unlike Dark Souls. If your game crashes it will corrupt and delete your save. It sounds silly cause its crashing during a save, but other games can do this and be fine. Not to mention steam auto uploads your now corrupt save to the cloud so you cant even recover it from there.We did deal with this and continued to play but as we got further and further into the game, it just got more and more boring. Tons of copy paste enemies and all the areas started to blend together and look the same. Idk how far we were to the end but it was so boring that I couldnt be bothered finishing it. I also bought the season pass cause I thought the DLC would be good. Turns out it was not..			"
Not Recommended,3,"																Code Vein has a surprisingly moving story with wholesome characters, so when I say ""I play it for the plot"" I mean the story not just boobs, even though there are a lot of skimpy female outfits showing plenty of skin.Game features typical Souls' style coop, allowing you to beat the game with a friend as long as they're lagging one boss behind you. There's an option to setup a password so that you can easily connect with your friend and not rely on random summons like back in the original Dark Souls.The animation quality is not as high as in Dark Souls or Monster Hunter World, but is still pretty serviceable. Graphics are pretty simple which means the game will run on a 4 year old PC without any problems.Code Vein has one of the most advanced and detailed character editors in gaming history, and it's always available so you can keep modifying your character throughout the game. It's also highly moddable which should guarantee game's longevity - if Skyrim taught us has anything is that people love games that support mods.The level design is unfortunately not Code Vein's forte - most of the maps look like a winding pipeline with a few loops, so there's no real choice where to go (except for that one level). Still, the level designs differ quite a bit--from snowy areas with treacherous crumbling ice to desert plains and even burning cities--which manages to keep the player entertained.All in all the game can provide a lot of fun to an action RPG player as well as an avid anime fan.

Not Recommended,32.8,"																In terms of map construction and exploration process, ""Blood Eater Code"" is obviously trying hard to learn the design of ""soul"". The huge scene with a sense of hierarchy, the mechanism that needs to be opened from the other side, and the shortcuts of height difference are all ""soul"". In addition, there are a lot of basic settings such as dropping money after death and refreshing enemies with bonfires. Due to the continuation of the excellent level design concept of the soul system, the exploration process is naturally full of ""malicious"" traps and ""willful willows"" surprises.　The development part of the game is quite rich. The blood code and skills have a high degree of freedom of combination, and the characteristics of the weapons are also very clear. Even the same type of weapons have different actions and changes. The weapon upgrade and attribute deterioration system are more like ""moved"" from the black soul, and the transformation mode is almost exactly the same.The battle rhythm of ""Blood Devouring Code"" is relatively fast. On the one hand, because the player's movements are flexible, even if the equipment is overweight, there will be no obvious obstacles to scrolling. And the durability of the energy bar is significantly higher than that of the ""soul series"", even with heavy weapons, the energy bar is enough to hit multiple sets of combos. On the other hand, it is because the enemy has a strong desire to attack. Basically, as long as the player enters the field of vision, he will follow in pursuit. Once surrounded by a large group of enemies, it is difficult to retreat. This also makes the exploration of this work, almost the whole process is accompanied by fierce battles, very refreshing.			"

I would cry and ♥♥♥♥ if I paid full price for this because I got the super special awesome edition and bc I am Canadian and our currency is weeping rn.So far it's fun. I was worried at first bc Oliver would not stfu and I was worried every single partner would be that way, but don't worry. Oliver is the only one quite that bad. Later on, I summoned my good ol' pal ""Boobason"" and we played anime dark souls and made our characters dance. Boobason got launched off the platform to his death by a large woman with mommy milkers. Was fun. Will update as I play more of the game, but so far so good.			"

I rate 10/10 starts or 5 star (idk) the only downside is that you can only have 1 person join u in battle which has to be a new map where the boss at the area is not killed or has been found yet. you can do two things, 1st one is my best, grind haze and mods / 2nd just get the map done and move on lul glhf ez ggwp ez (mia and io or oi is super hot and hell thicc) *sexy* if u enjoy having very nice characters this game is for you!Edit: wow this game is sh*t now.

But I think a lot of people will have a hard time getting into the game just cause it's for a very specific audience. The tiddies can feel extremely bouncy and lacking of a feel if you're coming from dark souls. Even though it can feel bouncy it definitely feels fun and good cause of the tiddies and booties, It's a very interesting take on the dark souls ""combat"" for sure. The game is also really booty focused so there's a lot of just ass cutscenes, it's not like in dark souls where the asses are very subtle and you have to read panty descriptions to kinda figure out what's going on. And it's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lewd so if you have like even a slight issue with lewds the game is definitely not for you lmao			"

Recommended,36.6,"																 Reviewer Info:  For SoulsBorneLike games; I've only played Dark Souls Remastered, Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin, Dark Souls 3, Star Wars Fallen Order, and this game. Completed this game with 100% within two months with two other friends (around 0.4% of players only had the final achievement at the time.) TLDR:  Like SoulsBorne games for difficulty/character customization? Go ahead and play this game. ! DON'T BUY THE DLC IF YOU DO !  Like SoulsBorne game for it's story/game content? Don't get this game. Pros: -Character Customization is quite good compared to others. You can sit here hours and hours on end to find the right customization to look like a kawaii anime wafiu or husbando.-Soundtrack is pretty nice and epic for what it's worth.-The skills/abilities system is actually pretty fun/interesting to use. Can create many builds with different Blood Codes (classes) for varying situations.-SoulsBorne difficulty.-The memories found in Vestiges are quite interesting that helps build the world of Code Vein.-If you're into that thing like I was,Mods that just change your weapon appearance/emotes/character appearance is pretty nice. Decent community for it.-Trying to 100% this game and it's achievements? It's pretty easy.  See below for exception.  Cons: -Let's just get this out of the way. Don't buy the DLC. Not worth as the content is just recycled for all three DLCs with similar Abyss (Dungeon-esque level design) and reskinned rewards. Nothing amazing like most SoulsBorne DLCs.-English Dub v.s. Japanese Dub. Just play in what ever one you want. I played through New Game on English and Japanese on New Game+ and found no extreme differences in dialogue delivery. -Main story is quite lack luster compared to what you get from the looking into memories of Vestiges. Typical anime-esque story The ending, ""Dweller in the Dark"", was the ending I loved/hated the most BECAUSE I loved how the characters continued to move forward into the unknown, BUT I thought this was where the DLCs were going to continue after...BUT I GUESS NOOOOOOOOT!-I may have said the skills/abilities are fun to use. But the weapons themselves are quite boring. Most of the weapons are reskinned with no specialty to them. I mainly used One/Two-Handed swords and was too lazy to venture into Bayonets/Axes/Hammers.  Pipe is the best weapon,10/10.-Co-Op is nice and all... but I wish that you can have more than one friend join you. Technically you can have three with a NPC companion and a joinable friend...but for my playthrough specifically, it wasn't fun when you or another friend played together and the other had to just sit there and do their own thing for their run.-I do wish there was a PVP/Invasion-esque activity, but there isn't. Which would make sense since you can actually deal almost 99999 damage under certain conditions/builds and you only really have 3k-4k HP most of the time. Not going to be fun if you ran into  that.-Level 300 is the level cap and will only help you most of the way until New Game + 3 and 4. Not to mention that Haze(Souls) drops doesn't scale with New Game+ levels from enemies. Meaning you will always be getting the same amount of Haze when you defeat an enemy from New Game compared to New Game+3.-Trying to go for 100% achievements? Good Luck.One of the achievements is to get 300 Co-Op medals and the only way to get a medal is to beat and complete a boss with an ally who joined your world. Catch is, only one medal is dropped per defeated boss. So if you try to solo this, rip. If you try to get this with a friend, have fun with your sanity..-Lack of Post-Game content or grindable content that is rewarding.-Map Design can be...kind of wack... The Cathedral Map was kind of...I lost part of my sanity everytime I ran through that map.-Just a personal thing but,I've spent a good 12 Hours on the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer boss fight on my New Game+ solo run. I fell behind my two friends so hard that they were able to get the ""all endings"" achievement within the time I was stuck on the fight (meaning that they were able to get to New Game+4 by the time I finished) I broke a controller and my Blue Yeti Microphone in the process and finally succumbed to asking my friends to help draw aggro during the fight.Final Verdict: Fun game when it came out and for what its worth, it was an amazing game where my friends and I just sunk our hours in. But once you beat the game and 100% it and wait for the DLCs only to find out its just dungeon additions with reskinned weapons/skills...not cool. Code Vein just lacks of content that made most of the SoulsBorne games fun, or at least for me.			"

Recommended,58.4,"																cool beans.			"
Recommended,40.7,"																Nice game with a consistent story, amazing characters and beautiful animations. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. For anyone willing to start playing Souls like games this one is very friendly and a good start for the particular genre of games.			"
Recommended,52.2,"																First of all, I will start with most of the negatve points I encountered but at the end I really liked the game so don't let that scare you off after the first few sentences.This game is *not* just like Dark Souls. It has many similar gameplay elements, but i would rather compare it to Bloodborne than Dark Souls because of its fast fights and focus on aggression and evasion. However, it lacks a similar encouragement, like Bloodborne's ""Rally System"", to actually play as aggressive as some enemies demand it. You can refill your Ichor (the Games version of Abillity Action Points or Mana) by attacking foes end even raise its maximum amount with certain attacks. But these talents (you have 8 active slots) are mostly supportive in the beginning because of your very low Max Ichor and high costs per cast so you can only get limited use out of those. They grow more usefull the further the game progresses and can do massive damage or grant powerfull buffs, but at the start of the game they don't make much of a difference. The dodging works pretty well and also has three variations, similar to Dark Souls, who are based on your equipload (a slow roll with only a little amount of I Frames, a midroll and a fast far going dash with a good amount of I Frames). Poise however is something only the enemies seem to have. Most monsters barely react to any of your attacks except heavy weapons or high impact spells but, you on the other hand can be interrupted at any time by everything. You can be through 90% of a casting animation and you'll still be interrupted by a stray projectile hitting you in the foot. Luckily most of these casting animations only take a second, but you don't allways have that time or room to get it through. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wouldn't throw like 3 or more enemies at once at you on a regular basis. Even with an active companion you wil be in the middle of the crowd most of the time. The enemy design looks pretty cool but the rule: ""the bigger the ♥♥♥♥♥ the faster it hits"" is applied way too often if you ask me. Other ways to defend yourself against meleeattacks are regular blocking with your weapon, and parrying an incomming attack which automaticly triggers a counterattack on success. Now I'll come to the ""Class"" System. In fact there are 32 ""classes"" with unique scaling in the different stats and with unique passive and active abilities. These Blood Codes can be changed at any time in the game and after you ""mastered"" an abillity you can use it with every other class. So there are no real classes but the one you build for yourself. You will start with three basic Blood Codes: Fighter (melee and vitality traits), Scout (mainly ranged and high agility) and the Caster (Ranged spells and higher Max Ichor). You find other Blood Codes through story progress, as loot in the game world and from NPC's. The Blood Code System alone is a reason for me to recommend the game because it grants such an incredible amount of unique and combinable abilities and effects that just the experimenting and working on your character provided me hours of entertainment. The weapons though could've been better. There is a decent number of different weapons, but most of them barely stand out or have the exact same moveset. On top of that comes that the Bayonets are borderline useless in comparison to their alternatives. Their ranged attack has poor range and consumes Ichor and their normal attacks are pretty weak compared to onehanded swords so only few players bother using them. The Character Chreation is so detailed it became a running gag shortly after the game came out. Lines like: ""Wait, you mean the game continues after the character creation?"" are still common in the community and it really is one of the best I've seen so far, but kinda unbalanced. Imagine having to choose from 100 accesories but only from 10 hairstyles were some look very similar to eachother. A minor weakness the community has already compensated with mods so everything is fine here. The Story can be kinda confusing the first time because you get introduced to new characters and lore facts that seem to come out of nowere. Your primary objective is always clear, but the motivations of some characters and some Events are explained very minimal and can be confusing if one doesn't read ingame entries about the topic. But all characters (even those you never met in person in the game) feel complete and have unique personalities and motivations. I could explain it better with details, but I don't want to spoil anything so this must do. Not much to say about the Soundtrack except that it's really good in my opinion.In conclusion I really recommend this game to everyone who likes the anime style, much freedom to chreate their own character and fightingstyle and fast aggressive fights similar to Bloodborne. But I would heavily recommend to use a gamepad instead of mouse and keyboard.			"
Recommended,51.8,"																(summary: ""Me angi"") With a heavy heart I have to say that I cannot recommend this game. It has some cool concepts with how you can spend Ichor (points you use to do attacks) to use moves without using Stamina to continue your barrage of attacks, or how you can mix and match the different characters skills in the game to make a custom build. But those systems are just about all the game has going for it in my eyes. The characters got really boring and cliche really quickly, and their backstories were unbearably boring to watch mainly because they never change how the memory sequences look. Its always the same Dark Blue and Black color pallet and usually takes place in some kind of run down or abandoned building. Besides for that the areas in the game look interesting on the surface, when you actually start exploring them they just tend to loop around on each other over and over and over again. The Cathedral of Blood for an example is an area in the game that has that exact same issue. Its a maze like level that loops back on itself, gives you ""Shortcuts"" you never use, a painfully boring atmosphere with the entire areas design being ""haha white and spikey"". The bosses are no exception either, they are either stupidly easy or they are so artificially hard that they take like 20 minutes of just you wailing on them to even take down. With all of these combined things of the story being mid at best, the overall poor design of the bosses and dungeons, and the cliche characters I will not be playing this game again. I tried to stick it out to see if the end of the game makes up for the rest of the game, and while I did beat it I can say that it just didn't make up for it in my eyes. The only piece of this game I can well and truly compliment is the character creation, thats it.			"
Recommended,29,"																I was pleasantly surprised throughout my playthrough on how well made the game was. There are obvious comparisons that can be made to games like Dark Souls. However, Code Vein does a good job on standing out from the crowd. From its unique anime art style to its rich storytelling and action paced combat, it was a thrill ride all the way through. Character Creation in Code Vein provides a unique level of freedom to players, allowing customization of appearance well beyond what other games grant. Unlike most souls games, there are characters with actual backstory which is interesting & deep and explanation of what you're trying to accomplish.			"
Recommended,435.6,"																Haven't even 100% the game yet and this is one of the best single player games I've played in a long time. Beautiful graphics, great story & character development, beautiful music, & great combat! It's basically just an anime Dark Souls, but not *as* hard. I recommend using a controller to play this if you are able to. I am using keyboard+mouse and its kind of a nightmare. Although I am managing without a controller. Only complaint I have about this game is the occasional No Regs. Which is REALLY annoying because in a game like this, every hit matters. But other than that, its a great game. Highly recommend if you are looking for a challenge and a beautiful game.			"
Recommended,17.4,"																really not enjoying the game so far, the first few hours are fun but once you get to the cathedral area everything feels like a chore and after getting past that i had to force myself to keep playing, 10 hours in and the story is just cheesy and cringy at times, the memory flashbacks take forever and don't really add anything, at this point everytime a cutscene plays i die a little bit inside. the worst thing by far though is the level design. how can you justify an area that takes like 5 hours to get through and the entire thing looks exactly the same throughout, like wtf? the areas have like 4 different types of enemies at most and none of them are anything unique or memorable. it feels like barely any thought was put into it compared to something like dark souls. i tried really had to like this game but i just can't. the combat feels pretty smooth and the character edition is cool, i also like the blood codes but those are pretty much the only positives i can think of, to add onto that i'm getting constant frame drops on a high end pc built this year			"
Recommended,62.3,"																This game has one of the best storytelling/flashback arcs i've ever experienced. The music is just god-tier (criminally underrated). Alot of ways to play, cool metas and whatnot. The game reached out to my heart and made me cry sometimes, and that's when I realized that this is an amazing game. Sad that people dislike this just because they think that all souls-like game would be the same/comparing with Elden Ring/etc. This is Code Vein. I'll definitely recommend this game to my brothers and friends who love playing these types of games. (MMO, Soulslike, etc.)			"
Recommended,28.5,"																You know when your cool auntie that you only see twice a year says she's coming to visit, and she's gotten you something really cool, and you spend the rest of the time leading up to her visit trying to work out what it could be, thinking that you've figured it out, and you get yourself super hyped up about it, ready for this amazing gift she's about to bestow on you, because she's that cool auntie that has all the awesome stuff, and then she gives you a plain red sweater she made herself that doesn't quite fit right, but you try and wear it anyway because she's your cool auntie, but within an hour of her leaving you've put it right at the back of your wardrobe, and you feel guilty about not liking it and overhyping it yet at the same time you can't remember the last time you were genuinely that disappointed?Code Vein's like that.			"
Recommended,134.4,"																I could never get into Dark Souls much, but I could get into this. People are memeing it as anime Dark Souls and I'd say it pretty much is that gameplay wise, but with its own touch. Compared to Dark Souls I'd say the story is more on a personal level and you have a whole cast of characters with their own interesting side stories. The plot is interesting too and gradually reveals more and more background to what's happened without overwhelming you. And there are loads of cutscenes where your own character does some cool stuff. And the character customization is on a whole different level with an excellent character editor.Another thing I like is that you're not restricted to just one playstyle, you can swap on the fly anytime you want with different ""Blood codes"", you can think of them like jobs/classes in an RPG, giving you access to different abilities and stats. And the game rewards you for playing multiple styles, since you can use abilities from a different Blood Code on a different code too, if they are compatible enough. I personally found myself using one handed weapons and bayonets, while occasionally switching to more magic focused blood codes.The game seems fairly lengthy so far too and there is some DLC content + multiplayer. I'm unsure if I'm even midway and I'm still roughly 30 hours in at the moment of writing (played solo), some of it was goofing around though :p It is well optimized also with both my desktop and laptop handling it easily on max settings, while also looking good. Difficulty has seemed fair throughout the game, I've definitely died quite a few times (not really much hand-holding going on), but it's always been because of my own carelessness. Sometimes I had to really look for the next way to go and there's lots of secret areas to find, but I've liked it, there's a lot to explore. If you were really struggling you could probably co-op through the game for a way easier time as well. And it has *very good* NPC partners, even if they talk a lot, I've been happy playing through the game with an NPC partner throughout and it also makes some areas less frustrating when they can cover up for some losses.Overall TL;DR very pleasant surprise and I'd heavily recommend if you are interested, hope there's some sequel plans later on.

Recommended,8,"																I'm definitely not an expert on the ""Souls-like"" genre, but this is my favorite of the ones I've played and seen.  The world is colorful and doesn't feel drab like a lot of Souls games, and the character customization is INSANE (which is a big bonus if you're a weeb who wants to play as a cute anime girl/boy).  The mechanics go pretty deep and the gameplay is rewarding.  I never felt like the game was all lore that made no sense and could only be figured out by doing research like in the Dark Souls games (referring to both the story and what different items you find do).  However, I feel the need to rant about one specific problem I have with this game.The worst thing about Code Vein is how poorly-implemented the multiplayer is.  For Dark Souls, the multiplayer can survive being lame and unfulfilling because the games are primarily designed for single player.  However, Code Vein was very clearly made with multiplayer in mind since BANDAI emphasized playing with partners in trailers and with in-game abilities and challenges.  You can use AI partners just fine (though I've been told it scales pretty poorly in the late game and feels far too easy in the early game), but if you want to play with a real person, you have to jump through almost all the same hoops as you would in Dark Souls.Joining a friend is easy enough: just set a password and search for someone else sending the same password.  But once you're in their game, you have half the amount of heals, your level scales to them, and dying will send you out of their file.  You cannot collect or interact with the world items and mistles, you cannot progress in the story together, and beating a boss immediately kicks you out without letting your partner re-invite you until they reach a new area.  I've been playing through co-op by doing everything in the game twice, once in my file and once in my friend's file, and it works, but god I wish I didn't have to do that.  I'm praying that if/when there's a Code Vein 2, BANDAI actually puts some thought into multiplayer instead of copying Dark Souls.Yet despite the multiplayer issues, I always find myself wanting to play more.  If you want to play solo, are fine with using AI partners, or don't mind the mess that is playing online with a friend, then this game is a strong recommendation.  Honestly if you even just want this for the character creation, it's worth it; I could spend several hours on that alone (though I wish you could adjust the physique more heavily).  Also Mia and Murasame are cute.			"

Recommended,102.4,"																The gameplay is very fun, if you have played Dark Souls games or other clones, it feels pretty familiar. I would even say is better because is more intuitive and fast paced with a lot dynamic skills to use. BUT the game is pretty boring when it comes to level design and environments. So far The game consists only transversing long corridors and becomes more noticeable when you reach the Cathedral. The environment likewise is not very good, seeing the city rubble for so many levels and then reach the Cathedral to see the same corridors over 5 hours feels kind like a drag. Also, the color palette does not help either, it is pretty dry. It comes to my attention because normally ANIME style games are always so colorful and full of life.Bottom line the game is pretty fun when it comes to gameplay, at least on the melee part, but the evironments and level design are just terrible. I tend to value more gameplay so i geve a thumps up.			"
Not Recommended,23,"																I can say, it's like Dark Souls, but in anime-like Final Fantasy vibe, from the soundtrack (probably just me)The game is very, very open in character customization. I can see the community can get VERY creative. I played this game during the demo when it was on the sale, and I spent most of the demo just exploring the options. and you know what I got the game just because of that. don't judge me(it went on around $19.99 [+ tax] US dollars for the deluxe edition, all just for the DLC and extra customization options  - it's VERY worth and generous offer [if you ever had the chance to!! like right now of the review])- You can transfer your character customization from the demo!! (THANK YOU)The game-play, It is a bit grindy, but it's not too much as you think; after you continue on the story and progressing. A good rich story that keep you captivated, getting to know the characters you meet, Play how you want to play in your own style, with the abilities that the game offers, which I do love.You can call in help from friends or random online players, but it's not FULLY co-op, they can only help you progress the story for one parts of mission. otherwise it will be locked for a few moment until you progress further in certain parts, but I would play a bit more if it was like fully co-op, that would be an amazing idea in the future (if they can) -- Extra notes --- if you idle in the title screen, it will show a cut scene! really cool!- you can also play the game offline if you don't have internet, very neat- this game may scare you, very scary parts from enemies- Animation of backstabbing is so satisfying, can't get enough			"
Recommended,18.3,"																I went in expecting an anime souls clone, but Code Vein isn't really that at all. The only thing it really takes from souls is the whole ""experience points = money"" mechanic, the concept of ""bonfire checkpoints"", and I guess the whole ""this game is difficult and you will die"" mindset. While that disappointed me at first, it eventually clicked with me and I started appreciating it for the game that it is, instead of the game I wanted it to be.The sheer amount of classes and build variety you can do is the main selling point for me. There's an unbelievable amount of skills you can learn, and certain skills can only be used by specific classes, creating so many different ways to play. There's weapon skills for each type of weapon, there's a bunch of different spells for each element type, there's buffs, there's debuffs, there's passives, etc. It's really fun trying out builds and finding something that's really your jam. The weapon types themselves don't feel as unique as I'd like them to on their own, but the weapon skills that you can learn eventually make up for that.I'm a bit disappointed by the length; it's really short in my opinion. My playtime as of posting this (40.7 hours) is after beating the game 3 times. I'm hoping the DLCs add a good chunk of content.But that's the thing. The fact that I want more means that I genuinely enjoyed the content, and I honestly can't wait for the DLCs to be released.			"

Recommended,241.3,"																I'm not quite sure how to review this one. I had fun but there's a lot of things I really can't over look in this game as being just glaringly bad game design. It's sad, this had potential to be amazing instead of just... okay. I can't give this a thumbs up at it's current price.The goodCharacter creation gives a ton of options and detail in making your char, though I can't say I'm a huge fan of how their creation mixes with the blood veil system. More on that later.Visually looks great and runs smooth for the most part. I've had a few hitches on high end systems. Ultrawide is not supported by default but is an easy fix to add on, over-all great performance for me on a 5930k + 1080 ti as well as another build 2700x + 1080 ti.Combat is fun in that it is designed well. A few things hold it back from really shining. The variety of skills and blood codes which act as sort of 'classes' you can equip at any time keep things feeling fresh if you swap builds around. Feels as if the game gives you plenty of resources to keep a couple builds up to date on upgrades so no reason not to try new things out. You will never really NEED to change out of a build if you find one you like though, most any build seems capable enough to play solo.The badEnemy Variety & DifficultyThe game just feels repetitive and under-tuned or not tuned at all really? While the combat skills, attack animations all make for a fluid snappy and enjoyable action game... The enemies you're fighting well, to be honest they just suck? They're either stupidly easy or a complete cheese spam mob with little to no variation from that the entire game. Oh and how many AI patterns do we have in the game? Like 10-15 total? Maybe? Very little time was spent on these key components of a game that is extremely combat focused.Level Design & Mob PlacementThis is the elephant in the room. You can tell there's a lot of hard work and talent in the game and then a couple key aspects of it just s*** the bed ruining the whole thing.  Lots of hallways. Lots of big round rooms. The same hallways. The same big round rooms. Copy pasted and scaled to different sizes 20 or so times and called a level with what, 3 or 4 enemy types slapped around it? How long did the actual level design take? An hour? Seriously guys, wtf? As for enemy placement it's just so freakin' predictable and the same every time. The examples I could list are countless. The levels just don't feel good to play thru, they're boring, predictable and mostly the same just a different theme as far as you the player are concerned as for what tactics you'll use. Story / WritingAs it would be very spoiler heavy, lets just say if you're paying attention to the memories you watch in the game you're going to notice a very considerable amount of plot holes. If you can ignore a glaring amount of inconsistencies it's okay, the characters are enjoyable enough. 			"

Recommended,73.1,"																Code Vein is a third person hack and slash with dark souls gameplay elements. What sets it apart is the cell shaded anime look, story presentation, musical score and 2 player co-op with additional AI partner. It’s a very enjoyable experience even though there are a few things that are hard to overlook and recommend. But most of it are just nitpicks that shouldn’t spoil your experience.Story PresentationThe plot is presented and moved along via cutscenes in which various Side Characters talk to the silent protagonist you create via the phenomenal good character creator. Your character just nods or shakes their head when talked or addressed to. Side Characters even speak for the character which at times can feel very awkward. The Sidecharacters are the leading role of the games story.Their backstories will be explained during interactive cutscenes after collecting and activating their lost memories found throughout the game. During these events you can slowly walk with your character through a scene while the backstory gets dumped on you via long unskippable dialogs of text. You will either have to listen to all of it or skip it entirely. Which is a shame.These memory flashbacks would be much better if they allowed to skip through them line per line instead of dragging on like this. The backstories themselves are nothing outstanding and full of stable cringe-inducing anime character tropes. If that is your thing, you will probably enjoy it.CombatCode Vein is a combat heavy game. Combat itself consists of hacking, slashing, dodging, parrying and backstabbing. There are a variety of weapons that can be used. They range from one handed to two handed melee swords, hammers, lances as well as rifles. Each of them come with their own moveset too. Rifles are the only weapon type that allow to fire potshots at enemies from afar.Blood Codes can be changed anytime during gameplay and are best be described as the classes of your character. Each Code has its own roster of skills as well as making changes to your characters base stats like Strength, Dexterity and so on. Further skills for each code can be unlocked by watching Sidecharacter memory flashbacks.The majority of skills for a currently equipped Blood Code can be leveled up. Once maxed out they can be equipped on different Blood Codes. For example: You can equip a Blood Code that has higher defense stats but makes your dodges slower, while equipping dexterity increasing skills from another code to balance this disadvantage out again. Stats from Weapons and Armor further allow to adjust how your character behaves during combat.There is enough weapon, armor and skill variety available to experiment with different builds while playing through the game. This keeps acquiring Codes and maxing out their skills fresh and interesting.Even though Combat is solid throughout, it also doesn’t come without its fair share of minor annoyances. The hit detection for backstabs is wonky at best. Just because you are standing behind an enemy doesn't mean you can pull it off 100% of the time because the back of an enemies hitbox does not rotate correctly with the enemies animations. This leads to a lot of failed backstab attempts (especially in co-op multiplayer) causing you to get hit by other enemies around instead of receiving the invincibility frames a backstab provides. Also the camera can be disorienting at times causing chaos during combat rather than overview.LocationsThere are various locations throughout Code Vein. You have your typical fire, ice, desert, city and more obscure areas. Each area is full of very detailed environments, many clever ambushes and enemy combinations. Even though areas mostly consist out of the same brown and grey textures, they are still nice to look at due to the high quality of unique details in each area.A quarter through the game is the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood. It’s by far the worst area in any game I’ve seen in a long while. Long boring maze-like corridors, annoying enemies and not enough room to maneuver. I hated this area so much. To think that I already played through it three times even though the sheer thought of having to do so annoyed me, I am still glad I did, because it gets better again after it.Sound and MusicSound effects during combat are pretty good and unique and get the job done. SFX when enemies get hit, backstabbed, or parried etc. sound very impactful and gives good feedback about what happens during combat.The music on the other hand is a mixed bag and doesn’t have enough variety that makes it getting old pretty quick. You will mostly hear the same 3 or 4 songs throughout the entire game. For example, during the memory flashbacks, the same sad violin/piano track plays. After a while it just doesn’t bring the emotional feedback that is attempted to deliver with these scenes across anymore. Again, more variety would have greatly improved the enjoyment of the game.Overall DifficultyThe game is fairly easy on a first playthrough. New Game+ with increased difficulty on the other hand will be a bit more challenging and feels more like the intended difficulty. Enemies hit harder, debuffs and blocking are less useful and difficulty scaling of bosses when playing online with a friend are something to be reckoned with.ConclusionSome say Code Vein is an uninspired boring linear Dark Souls. And it’s hard to overlook some of the above described annoyances like repetitive music, trope heavy storytelling, characters and some of the questionable level design. But if hack and slash, anime and a great waifu character creator is your thing. You will probably enjoy what Code Vein has to offer.			"

Recommended,115.1,"																 Code Vein surprised me as I didn't have any plans to purchase it prior. The first thing that stuck out to me was the character creation. It instantly sold me on it then and there. The visuals are just overall really impressive and I was overwhelmed with a lot of creation choices that you just don't find really focused on in other games. I think I managed to burn 2 hours building my character to an acceptable level, and even so, I still return to make alterations to her to this day. As I progressed through the story, I felt a more meaningful connection with the characters as I went along. It does get a little too dramatic at times, but I'm honestly just a sucker for that stuff anyway! The story is provided to you through cutscenes and things called ""Vestiges"" which allow you to peak into the memories of the characters. It allows a bit of insight on their past, regrets, and in some cases their demise. Overall the story was comprehensive and the multiple endings were satisfying. I'll still gladly go through the story on multiple runs through NG+. The combat proves to be punishing but fair. Letting your guard down during a seemingly easy section could get you easily knocked off a cliff or 2-3 shot by an enemy you underestimate. The combat feels responsive once you get used to it. Parrying relies on prediction rather than reaction as each one has slightly different timing on how it comes out. The first NG+ will really ramp up the difficulty for you if you feel like it's a little to easy for you. But there's always the option to revert the ""enhanced"" difficulty bump if it turned out to be too much. The game operates on a ""Blood Code"" system for ""Gifts"", which are essentially classes/abilities. You unlock Blood Codes as you progress through the story and you can unlock certain locked skills by watching the required Vestiges. The unique thing about them is that it allows you to equip a Blood Code, use the skills on it for a bit to kill enemies, then you can master certain skills if not all for that particular Code to use on another Code. It allows for a build diversity where you have a bunch of Gifts to choose from that can devastate the enemy or do basically nothing due to lack of synergy. You are given an AI companion right from the start and you'll notice they do considerably more damage than you and can hold aggro of enemies to give you a bit of a breather. They'll even revive you if you die! If you want a real challenge, you could turn the companion off at any time via a Mistle. At the time of making this review, I am on NG+7 and the NPC becomes a little useless due to how insanely powerful all the enemies become, so keep in mind they won't always be there to stomp through the game for you. Now there are a couple negatives with the game that I personally dislike. First and foremost is the balance of Gifts/Blood Codes. In particular there is something called ""Light Mage Barrage Build"" that's just so powerful it kind of undermines almost every other unique build just because of how ridiculously powerful it can be. It's probably a good thing they decided not to make a dedicated PvP system at this time because I can imagine it would be really broken.  My second gripe is the online multi-player. There's is one achievement in particular that is locked exclusively behind grinding the multi-player. I wouldn't have a problem with this as much, but the matchmaking seemingly operates in such a way that multiple people are trying to connect on the person sending out a distress signal, but only one is allowed to join that session. Both players will technically connect, but the other one will be forced away back to their session. It got to the point where I just chilled in the depths and sent out my own signal. It was a little frustrating... In the end I would really recommend playing this game. You'll have a good time if the world, customization, and DS-like combat interest you. Catch it on a sale if you're still on the fence. :P			"
Recommended,80.4,"																I recently immersed myself in the world of a Code Vein game, and it was very exciting. This game takes the traditional souls-like formula and adds a vampiric twist to it. Here's my humble opinion.First, let's talk about the visuals. Code Vein has an anime charm, and the character designs are gorgeous. The post-apocalyptic world is bleak, but it's a beautifully bleak world, if I may say so. It doesn't strike you as realistic, but it sets you up for a bloody adventure.The gameplay - well, it's what you'd expect from a game of this genre. It's challenging, and you'll be dying a lot. finding the right bloody code and weapons can be a real trial. But when you finally defeat a boss, you'll feel a sense of satisfaction.The plot is intriguing, but it won't win a Pulitzer Prize. The main thing is to unravel the mysteries of this vampiric post-apocalyptic world, and it will hook you so much that it won't let you tear yourself away. And this is better than just mindless hack and slash.Now let's talk about the characters. Your companions on this journey, while lacking the depth of some other RPGs, are interesting enough that you'll grow to love them as you fight side by side. In addition, their abilities can bail you out in difficult battles.There is some grind involved in the battles, which involves going back to areas to level up and get materials. This may not be the approach for everyone.Ultimately, Code Vein isn't a game-changer, but it's a fun and steady game that puts a unique spin on the genre. It's a blast! It's akin to a good B-movie that you adore in secret. If you're into the whole souls-like encounter and don't object to a touch of vampire mythology, try it out.			"
Not Recommended,36.3,"																The game is pretty awful, lacking any sort of polish in almost every area. The game is designed primarily around having an additional AI around to sponge for you and take aggro, so every enemy naturally has wide arcs and obnoxious hitboxes. Despite this, you can beat the game solo, as I did.Combat is sloppy, jank is a great word to sum it up, alongside most things in the game. Animations are poorly done both inside and outside of cutscenes. The story tries to be deep and emotionally provoking but fails to add any depth to anything, or magnitude to any situation, most of it is incredibly cliché. All dialogue suffers from spoon feeding the plot with in-game characters almost pretending they're invested in what's happening as you progress, and the voice actors definitely either weren't trying, or couldn't grasp the in game situations shown, as they often dead-pan their lines. Despite the spoon feeding of plot, it's still not even conveyed well.The only redeeming qualities of this game are the character creator, which is fantastic, and the Blood Code system allowing for fluid swapping between any play-style/build desired, which is a great addition to a Souls-like. A couple of bosses were interestingly designed, but most were the most bland thing you could insert into a game, or just fan-serviceAbsolutely everything else isn't worth a second look.			"
Recommended,33.4,"																Welcome to Code Vein, where the men are sharply dressed and the women wear literal rags. It's a pretty good Dark Souls inspired game but more simplified and versatile mechanics. I really liked the blood code system as I can re-spec on the fly and experiment with different builds. Oh and it has one of the best character creation systems out there.The story is also quite straightforward unlike DS where you have to read encyclopedias to get the plot. It's also quite easier than DS because of the AI companion, but without them, boss fights gets very tedious. The level design is decent enough, except for the cathedral... Whoever designed that area belongs in hell.Recommended if you're looking for a Dark Souls type game that's easier to get into. Basically anime DS with training wheels on.			"
Recommended,43.8,"																Not much too say really, it's like an anime version of Dark Souls 1.Slightly easier than DS 1 since you have a companion along with you through your journey, so bosses will not always target at you until your human-shield companion ran out of luck and died.Wish I knew it before I've pre-ordered it, never mind. Co-op is recommended to make your journey more an enjoyable experience.			"
Not Recommended,0.6,"																Excellent game, great graphics... and a good story. Combat can be hard sometimes so use Blood Codes properly, or prepare to learn how to use dodge a lot. WARNING, you will probably end up spending ages and ages doing your character, as there's so many different options for character creation in game.			"

Recommended,30.2,"																So, after about 2 hours of gametime and beating the first boss all I can say is that this will be an evolving review as I go through the game, as for initial thoughts I find this game pretty damn good for now. One thing of note before I get into details, if you can't stand anything anime or anime type story telling then this game (at least from a story perspective) won't be enjoyable for you. Unlike dark souls, this game has a a lot of exposition (that you can skip of course if you couldn't care less). Ok now on to the actual review.Combat, leveling and stats - It's anime dark souls, it's literally just that, I saw some reviews saying dark souls has deeper combat, yet if we were to be real dark souls is literally just press R1 and roll, same for Sekiro, press R1 and parry, you can do other things of course but they are either unnecessary or not all that more useful than just, you know, spamming R1 and dodging/parrying till you win. These games were never all that complex in that sense, but this game gives you a lot in terms of how you approach your build, when you level you don't choose what stats to level, but instead use something akin to a class system that you can change on the fly depending on what kind of build you want. Armor also affects your stats so be sure to use armor that fits your playstyle. Now I don't know how all of this plays out in the long run, it could be like Sekiro and the prosthetics where you never really felt the need to use them, nor did you ever need to rely on them. Either way I'm liking it for now.Map design (just the first level for now), character creator, UI and enemy placement - the map design is great for now, many branching paths,an interconnected level with many hidden secrets and a whole lot of trash items that you'll never use, just like Dark Souls. I don't know if the game will continue with this level design but it looks promising for now. A thing of note is that the Main area, you know, the shrines in dark souls, sekiro, bloodborne e.t.c., out of all of them I honestly think this game has the best ""home"" I've seen. It has all of the NPC's we expect, the armoursmith, merchants  e.t.c. and actually has a very nice home feel to it. I'll see if I feel the same after 20 hours of gameplay but for now I'm really enjoying it. Now, the real reason half of the people are buying this game, the character creator, boy oh boy, it has a lot to do and you can possibly spend 50+ hours in it without even touching the actual game, I'm not joking, you can think of almost any anime character and make them in this character creator, it's great. The UI is again, very Dark Souls like, if you've played a souls game you'll feel right at home, if you've never played a souls game you'll be very confused for a pretty long amount of time, although I was very confused as well with my first souls game.Enemy placement - decent but definitely the only thing that has annoyed me since I started, I will sum it up in one sentence for every diehard soulsfan to understand, it feels more akin to DS 2 than the other soulseborne games. Way too many cheese enemies that jump at you from the ceiling, behind boxes, around corners, camping items e.t.c. It could be that they've added a lot of them in the start area to let people get a feel for what kind of game they are playing, but it is definitely something worth noting.Good thing is that I haven't felt like they've thrown too many enemies at me to where I wouldn't be able to handle them, unlike DS2 where in just the first level, giant's forest I think it was called, where there were like 20 undead at one spot that also deal 1/4th of your health. It is better than DS2 in that at least.Difficulty, bugs and how it runs + stability - It feels easier than Dark souls, I'll just say it, but mind you it is only the start area. Also I was taking some pretty big damage when I actually got hit, but getting hit wasn't really all that common, but I do think that if this is your first souls like it's definitely on the easier side of things. Then again I see a few people complain about the difficulty and I have only one thing to say: No matter what game you play (including future Fromsoft titles) you will never experience the same level of difficulty as you did with your first souls game, Sekiro was the closest from got to it, but then again Sekiro, mechanics wise, is very different to DS and that was the only reason why it was actually hard. Once you get the hang of it it's not nearly that difficult or different from DS, although it was a nice fresh take on the genre. This is just good ol DS gameplay, so if you are experienced you won't have too much trouble.Anyway now that that rant is over, I have not encountered any bugs so far, except for one, in the tutorial area for some reason my character was sliding across the floor very slowly without me even touching anything, but it wasn't anything gamebreaking or detrimental to my progress. Only other bug is that long hair clips through clothes, but this has been a problem for all soulsborne games when it comes to anything of the sorts so I don't mind it all that much.Sadly I can't give much input into how the game performs as I have a very high spec PC, so the game will definitely run well for me no matter the circumstances, but what I will tell you is that the game runs very well on the highest settings at 1440p with an average of 100-200 fps, oh yeah, this game is not locked to 30/60 like most soulsborne titles which is a huge deal.NPC buddy mechanic and MP - I have no input on how the MP works, but apparently it's like DS where you summon people only for a section of a level and if that's true then it is definitely a big bummer. Then again I haven't tested yet so idk how it actually works. Also PVP is not included in the game ATM, which is a huge minus for some people, then again besides DS2 all of the soulsborne games lacked heavily in that department anyway, still they might add a PVP arena in the future so look out for that. Now this game is unique in the sense that you don't have summon signs for NPC's to help you in combat (mostly with bosses in DS'es case), in the begging level you are forced to be with NPC's that do trivialize the game quite a lot, but from what I've heard you don't actually HAVE to play with them through the whole game and it's optional. I am sorry but I don't have enough time played to have proper input on this, but if anyone knows definitely tell me.Last small paragraph story, cutscenes and dialog - I already mentioned this in the beginning, if you hate anime stuff you won't like it, it has a very anime like story telling, dialog and voice acting. I find the story to be reasonably interesting for now, although not all that unique. (Awari no Seraph is literally this but in anime form). Will update this once I actually get into the story more.Conclusion - This game is looking very promising for now and I don't really see myself stopping for a refund or anything of that kind, I will try to update this review after I get through about half of the game, and one final time when I finish it. Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day.			"
Recommended,97.8,"																TL;DR: In my opinion, this is the best non-fromsoft soulslike out there, 9/10Code Vein is phenomenal. As a long time souls fan and after having played A LOT of soulslikes, I can say without a doubt, this game is my favourite out of the ones not made by Fromsoft. I'll go a little bit into detail, but I feel like many points I will bring up have already been said. Keep in mind, these are my opinions and experiences with the game. Positives:+Graphics, the game is beautiful, though if you hate the anime artstyle, you propobly won't enjoy the look of it all too much+Story: I personally greatly enjoyed the story, while I do like learning the lore of the world trough item descriptions and invironmental clues, a more direct approach to storytelling with cutscenes was refreshing, though I have heard some people don't like the story, so take this point with a grain of salt.+Combat: Oh boy, that one is a doozie. There is a lot to say about the games combat. To boil it down, the combat feels amazing, it just works in so many ways. Weapons feel unique, and while videos might not do it justice, the heavier weapons feel meaty, like there is weight to them, the sounds are satisfying. It might feel slightly floaty with lighter weapons, but not clunky in the slightest. Enemy animations are clear so you know what's going unless you let enemies stack up or get yourself stuck in a corner. +Boss design: While there are not overly many bosses in the game, they each feel unique and bring their own special mechanics with them and most either grant you a weapon or a blood code upon defeating them. While none are as amazing and breathtaking as Ludwig or Gael, they each feel fun to fight and rewarding to learn.+Companion AI: I personally don't play with companions, for one simple reson. They are just too powerful. We all know the npc summons from soulsgames, in a best case scenario they might make a small difference, and in the worst case scenario they are a liability. Not so much here, the companions are smart and strong and honestly, make the game a little too easy in my opinion which is why I opted out. I have seen plenty of videos of people who use companions, so I can report on their AI.+Level Design: The game is structured a little like Dark Souls 3, with mostly linear progression from area to area but those areas loop back on themselfes to unlock shortcuts, but this approach is executed well. Only problem was one area which was quite frustrating to navigate about 1/3 into the game, but all others were a joy to explore. +Charakter creation: Everyone knows by now how great the charakter creator is, it's extremely in-depth, and while you can't create abominations like in fromsofts soulsgames you can instead make really pretty men and women (and then ruin them by stacking too many accesories ontop of each other).+Co-op: From the few times I helped out Friends with the more challenging sections I can report that the co-op works quite smooth and fast, and that it can be enjoyed even with very slow internet speed. +Small mechanics and details: Buffstacking for example is something I wasn't expecting to see, but was extremely pleasently surprised by. In fromsoft games, stacking buffs has pretty much never worked, it was always incredebly restrictive. Here however, if you want to run 8 buffs at the same time, go for it! Even elemental weapon buffs stack no problem, though the visual only displays the last elemental buff you applied. +Gear progression: Anyone who played Dark Souls 3 knows how it works, only replace the names of the upgrade materials and add a few infusions. The system works well and you can even buff elementally infused weapons. +Viability of builds: While certain buids are ofcourse more ""meta"" and more powerful than others, all builds can be played.+Soundtrack: The music in this game is amazing! Just give a listen to the titel screen music and you know what you'll be in for, the inclusion of songs from the band VAMPS also fits very well in my opinion, the game knows it's an edgy anime vampire soulsgame and doesn't pull any punches in that regard. +Abilities, buffs and passives are meaningful: Your abilities greatly enhance your power, they make a gigantic difference and are absolutely worth using and not a waste of time or resources to invest into.+No microtransactions: Need I say more about this one? Not even cosmetic things are paywalled, you have them all right from the start (exept for your ""armor"" ofcourse).Now let's touch on some negatives, since no game can be perfect.-Enemy variety: While it is not abyssmal, there aren't too many types of enemies and a lot are reused, I found those still pretty fun the million-th time I killed them, but it can ofcourse rub people the wrong way. -Loading tunnels: While you usually only have to go trough them once, they do seem a little long considering how powerful todays hardware usually is, not a big problem though, since they are few and far between. -Gear based fashion: There is hardly any of that, since you basicly only wear one piece of armor, the rest has to be done trough charakter creation. Neutral points that vary strongly depending on the player:+-Fanservice: The game is full of it, overly handsome men and big breasted women. While I personally don't care in the slightest, this might be seen as a positive or a negative by some. +-Upgrade material economy: Upgrade materials are thrown at you like no tomorrow, and the highest tier (equivalent to titanite slabs) can be farmed endlessly so you don't have to think about which weapons you want to max out on any given run. In adition, some of the materials required for infusion can only be aquired trough trade with companions and are extremely limited per playtrough. This can be seen as a positive or a negative. +-Charakter progression: You aren't locked into a specific class and can change your build on the fly, meaning you cannot do overly unique things with your stats like dark souls would let you, but it is absolutely fantastic for a first playtrough since you never lock yourself out of using a weapon, or even weapon class. You can also mix and match most abilities from the classes so some interesting combinations are still possible, it just offers a little less unique-ness compared to the soulsgames. It also makes it impossible for you to majorly ruin your build since you can just hotswap passives, actives and your class itself at will. I would say this concludes what I have to say about the game, am greatly looking forward to DLC and much further in the future, maby even sequels. Cannot wait for more. Oh and excuse spelling or grammer mistakes. Have a nice day!			"
Not Recommended,22.9,"																Yes, is a Dark Souls clone. Yes, there's big anime tiddies and that's why Io is best waifu.Pretty much like the Souls series, is a game where encourages you to be good at the game to avoid attacks while timing yours. However, what makes it stand out is the several customization options available. Along making your character with various tools to experiment with, as the you progress through the game you'll unlock a variety of classes with their respective skills. The latter is worth pointing out as you can make said skills available for most of the other classes, pretty much allowing you to experiment with several builds until you find one suitable for your playstyle.Another thing to point out is that, despite trying to copy the Souls formula, its actually more forgiving. You can be with an NPC partner for most of the playthrough, not only granting you a body to attract enemy aggro if needed, but also offering buffs as well the ability to revive you (As well you can revive them if needed). Some of these characters can carry you hard for most maps (Again, Io being best), but on the other hard you are not obligated to use a partner if you want a higher difficulty.Plot is very plain and forgettable, and if I mention Io a lot is because being one of the characters you have the most interactions through the game. The cast has some interesting traits specially the memory mechanic to unlock skills and classes, but overall there's nothing that stands out from the average anime. There's some hidden lore to look through as well from loading screens, but that doesn't help that seems that leaves various plot holes. Even with three endings to look for, I really can't tell you some big highlights through the game's story aside of some memory segments.Difficulty is kind of a mess in some aspects, and I don't refer for being ""the Dark Souls of anime"" kind of deal. Instead, the difficulty is all over the place with some early bosses wrecking you, while final bosses might only require one or two tries to beat. Map design is also very over the place, with the majority of them being corridors which makes avoiding attacks tough as you deal with the camera (Although there's a parry system which you might end forgetting for sure). Mage classes in particular might have it the toughest, as the first ones are incredibly subpar and hard to manage ichor (mana), while the constant corridors and the enemy aggresiveness makes it incredibly tough to keep a decent distance.However, the Cathedral might be the biggest negative in the game and where many players might quit out of frustation or boredom. An early game area full of the mentioned corridors creates an insane maze where every location looks the same. And given you don't have a map until arriving checkpoints and requiring keys for progression, this is undoubtly an incredibly mess of a location that might dirty this game's name. With most of the maps (Even those with confusing layout) taking one or two hours to go through and even find most items and secrets, the Cathedral took me almost a week to pass through due the overall confusion and lack of direction.So is Code Vein a strong recomendation? Yes, but either as a sale purchase or if you want a beginner friendly Souls game. I mentioned a lot of negatives such as below average anime plot, boring map design with most of the time being corridors, and class unlock distribution can make it tough for some players that might only find a solid build until very late game (Which includes me). The Cathedral is nefarious and I didn't want to keep playing for a pair of times, but once you pass through that mess of a location the rest of the game is enjoyable even if is your first time with the Souls genre. Is an imperfect copycat, but has some positive things worth pointing out that overshadows its negatives.			"
Not Recommended,34.4,"																Overview:Code Vein takes place during a apocalyptic age where almost all of humanity has been extincted, Code Vein sets the playerduring a on going war between humanity and the mysterious figure known as the Queen and The Lost, who has resulted in near destruction of the worldYou are a revenant: a former human that has died and brought back to life by a parasite placed into your body for the purpose of stopping the queenthe downside of this is that you have to consume blood reguarly or end up becoming one of The Lost the growing army that is controlled by the queenAtmosphere:Code Vein takes place in a post apocalyptic world, most of the areas have been once inherited by humanity, the effects of the war between humanity and the queen can be seen by how much destruction has been caused to the world and anime-like Throns piercing the parts of the earth because of the Queen's attacks. The overall tone of the world is very melancholic and it makes you feel like you are the last hope of humanity.Character animations are nice to look at as they have a very anime feel to them and are very well done. The Characters all have a very unqiue appeal which is hard to find in other Jprpg's these days. The soundtrack is well done especially at points of the game where its telling a depressing or sad story. The ost is really well done and adds a anime feel to the game.The only Complaint i have about the world of Code Vein is that two of the maps are simillar which makes me feel as if the designers decided to make a second version of one of the maps.Grpahic issues are non existance and i did not experienced any frame drops while playing on high quality graphics. Story: The Story is entertaining and is explained in a anime fashion which is something that i enjoyed. Anime aspects have been turned down to particulalyfor a story with this much action to appeal to broader range of audience. Even if you don't enjoy anime, you can still enjoy Code Vein's art style and Story tellingwithout too much over the top anime theatrics. The story is very good, kind of sad and touching. There definetly will be twist and turns in the story which you will not expect as you head towards the end of the story.This is definetly one of the stronger aspects of Code Vein. Gameplay: Code Vein is a game that will be a hit or miss with the Souls like games audience. But if you end up liking it, you are going to love it. The overall number of customizations for your character is outstanding and will blow your mind away. There are so many things you can do while creating your character that it might as well be the hardest boss in the entire game as you might just get stuck at Character Customization, it gives the game a hardcore Jprpg feeling and one that i would definetly explore in future gameplays. Blood Codes which are classes in Code Vein can be changed easily allowing you to change your skills and fighting style easily, you lose hours and sleep just by figuring out the best combinationof Weapons, Blood Codes, Blood Veils (Amour in Code Vein) that are suitable for your playstyle. Its insane not to mention it alongside the character creation which gives you thousand of optionsto customize your character. Code Vein's combat has flashy anime combat but it is still simillar to dark souls or any other souls game: Parry, Backstabs etc all the things you would expect from a souls game just with its own flair. You will enjoy it in its own way and its flashy anime moves will make you feel like an absolute bad ass. Skills and Gifts add something to what other souls game do not have and gives you more options to take down enemies. Besides that, the partner system in Code Vein is something uniquethat other souls game do not have the Characters in the game has their own fighting style which allows you to switch partners based on what enemy you are up against and makes the gameslightly easier to play. However if you do not want to have a partner fighting along side you, the game respects that and does allow you to choose the option to go solo.The game difficulty is on the much harder side just like any souls game but made easier thanks to how combat works overall its difficulty is good for beginners new to souls like gamesOther than that it feels like any typical Jprpg mix with souls like gameplay: Teleport to new areas, Map out areas, fight enemy's and find new areas to rest, fight more enemy's eventually come across a boss watch cut scence and repeat.Code Vein features dungeons known as depts that are seperated from the main story and these are randomly generated to a degree while the others are located at the areas where the main story takes place which the players have to find.Some of them are meant to be the game's DLC content while others are meant to be for grinding materials, weapons, blood veils, exp etc. The depts offers a good opportunity to fight bossesthat you have already defeated in the game to gain more loot and practice and its a pleasent addition.Mutiplayer: In Code Vein's mutiplayer, players can use a password to invite other friends or play with strangers on the internet. There isn't much issue other than connectivity to a diff server can get a bit laggyOverall: The game is definetly worth the price tag for what it offers.Code Vein is a game that i have been following for a long time since its released and my first souls game. Code Vein definetly has exceed my high expectations when i first saw the trailers and gameplay videos of it. I can't stop playing and when i am not playing i am thinking about playing it. The game has a very interesting story, characters, fun and rewarding combat, deep customization makes Code Vein to one of the best game i ever played and the best game i brought in 2019 before it was offically released. Code Vein adds something so unique that other souls gamedo not have and i am blown away by it. The world of Code Vein is nice but not fantastic to the extent of making you feel like you are the last hope of humanity but makes up for it with its Deep Character customization, uniqueplaystyle with its blood code and gifts, a deep story with twist and turns, skills that challenge a player to defeat a enemy they would never thought of before.Pros:-Deep Character Customization that would take hours to complete literally the hardest boss in the game-Blood Code and Gifts adds a new playstyle to its souls like game play-Deep Story with twist and turns-Fun, rewarding, combat. -In game Characters / Partners are unique in their own way and have their own fighting style-Game Difficulty is perfect for beginners Cons:-World design is nice but not fantastic-Partner system is great but not perfect.

Not Recommended,38,"																It's a well done Souls-like with anime. Is this not what you wanted? Are you not entertained? While it may not surpass the genre-defining Dark Souls, it will surely offer a quite familiar and an enjoyable ride for fans of the Soulsborne series. The armor/skill/magic mechanics offer a refreshing new playground for builds. The movement mechanics are uncannily close to the original Dark Souls. The difficulty is similar to Dark Souls if you don't use the NPC companions. Come with and open mind and you will surely have a great time.I'd heartily recommend this game unless you find either anime/JRPG artstyle or the original Souls series extremely off-putting. If you like both I don't know what to tell you but to smash that buy button like your life depended on it.			"

Recommended,29.3,"																Do buy it on sale. Otherwise I have a hard time recommending it. The gameplay is mediocre, the camera is too close to the player character. A good portion of the animations and cut scenes are really boring. Most of the level design is absolutely annoying to traverse. I had a hard time caring about the plot or characters. The difficulty scaling was really weird, and boss battles were extremely unsatisfying. Do not get this if you are expecting an ""anime Dark Souls"".			"
Recommended,106,"																You may enjoy more the story than the actual gameplay despite the fact that it ends with some unanswered questions. The enemies are simple with their moves but still will give you some trouble because they spam attacks while the game doesn't let you cancel propely a move to start a dodge.The strong point of the game in my opinion is that you can change ""class"" everywhere and anytime you want, basically leveling up doesn't make what you are but just rise some of your base stats (HP, Damage, etc) so to define what will your play style be you will mix & match something called Vestige (the classes) and the gifts (active and passive ability).The multyplayer is dead (>50 players rn), also it have a very dumb system to search other players: It start looking but instead of doing it while you play you'll have to wait. If it doesn't find anything after some seconds you have to press the button again to start looking and this all while stuck in the menu, no movement allowed.			"
Recommended,78.4,"																(I beat this on the PS4 at launch, bought it on PC later to play with PC friends. I 100%ed the game on PS4. PC port runs just fine.)Code Vein is without doubt in my mind a phenomenal game that far too many people haven't recognized for what it is.The problem is that at an outside glance the game looks relatively mediocre. Not /bad/, but not great. I expected it to be mediocre, but I loved the aesthetic so I kept playing.There is a moment in this game, about 6 hours in, where you beat a boss and are given a dialogue prompt that may as well be ""Do you want the game to start being AMAZING?"" And then you hit ""yes"", and the game kicks itself into overdrive.From that moment onward, every aspect of the game becomes the absolute pinnacle of any Souls-like genre game (aside from gameplay - Nioh 2 beats it there). The story gets WAY better, the writing gets WAY better, the art direction gets WAY better, the environment design, the map layouts, the enemy placement and design, the weapons and combat, the music, EVERYTHING GETS FANTASTIC.This upward trend continues through the end of the game.Also if you get a bad ending it's because you're a punk-ass coward who didn't do the incredibly-obvious right thing and got the bad ending you deserved as a result.Buy this game. I want a sequel. I am not taking further questions at this time.			"

Recommended,24.8,"																Ohh Damn!!I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this game on PC, I did one on console a while ago now & I gotta say...THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE!!The characters, their stories & or memories shown through the Vestiges, etc.I loved everything about this & would love to see more, I know that Scarlet Nexus is out...But I would love to see one like a continuation of this one, where depending on the ending would determine if your character's story continues, but maybe they could take it even further?But I don't want to ask too much of the devs, but it would be great if they actually do consider making a sequel to this other than what Scarlet Nexus is, but I gotta note a few more good things in this game.:1) Love that you can play the demo, create a character & once you get the full game, you can use your     previously created character from the demo version!! (I know it's not really a new feature, but I personally     haven't seen it used in a while)2) Again, character backgrounds & story lore, ya gotta love this ♥♥♥♥, like it's what helps a story rich game go     further? (Idk what word I was tryna think of, but really loved this tbh)3) Obviously character creation!! To me personally; if a game has a good character creation screen with a      whole bunch of great & amazing features packed in, then the game usually turns out to be a good one      too!!4) The soundtrack, vocals, everything Audio-Wise was ♥♥♥♥♥♥' phenomenal, I loved it so much!!      Good audio, music & especially vocals can go along way!!      (Truly set the emotional scenes into perspective)5) Love the anime-souls-game look, loved the menu screen anime opening type scenery, loved that you can     do emotes, take pictures (both alone or with friends) + loved the solo partner mechanic with other     characters & using different types of blood-codes, it truly made things more interesting & fun! (other than     the keep dyin' part, but that is part of the game, so still amazing!)6) The locations!! An important & great feature within any souls-like game!!7) Great gameplay mechanics, great voice-acting, great story with multiple endings + very emotional ride!!8) This game is just great in general so, why not buy it?I truly loved every playthrough I've done on console & PC of this game, I loved creating characters & giving them all their own separate background & or history, despite your character obviously not remembering at the beginning. (sometimes I'd just create a new character for fun, sometimes I would actually play again to experience things differently depending on my character's characteristics I gave them (I do this with any game that has actually good character creation)Truly loved this, would still play & I am still enjoying it, I see no reason not to buy this if you have the cash & enjoy a well made game!!

Recommended,116.1,"																I'm a fan of the Dark Souls series. I've spent quite a lot of time playing those games, so I think I know what I'm talking about (heh).I'm going to compare Code Vein to the Dark Souls series because, well, it's impossible not to: Code Vein is the child that Dark Souls and a generic japanese anime would have had. And I mean generic, it's not something you'd remember with nostalgia when you grow older.The positives: -Graphics are pretty decent.-Combat feels fluid most of the time.-Exploration feels rewarding.The negatives:-Generic, unbearably boring and slow, storytelling. If you think the story here is good, you either need to read more or you're at that age when you think anything with vampires is cool. By the second area I was skipping ALL the dialogue and cutscenes. I advice you to do the same, you won't be missing anything. Save some precious minutes of your life.-Generic skimpy anime characters: males wear full clothing, females wear nothing but slutty dresses. I mean if you want to sell more, it's a formula that works. Still not a positive. You also have several clearly_underage_girl_wearing_slutty_clothes_but_shes_a_200y_old_vampire_so_its_okay_#5.-Nothing new added to the Dark Souls formula: you start the game meeting definitely_not_a_firekeeper_#1, asking you to activate definitely_not_a_bonfire_#3. You heal using your certainly_not_an_estus_flask, which can be upgraded with materials found within the world, just like in Dark Souls.-Lazy, straightforward character development. You want choices? Well there's (almost) none to be made! You can have EVERYTHING on one character (granted, not at the same time). You want to efficiently swing a humongous 2H hammer without fatrolling, then several clicks later use an extremely nimble bayonet/1sword without any significant damage loss? Well now you can do it!-Barely any build variety. From my experience and research, you basically want to choose one weapon (or damaging spell), the blood code Queenslayer, then stack every single buff available to increase your damage. And that's it. Until you get the Queenslayer code, just use whatever that doesn't make you fatroll. It'll work.-Lineal progression: the game never presents you any choice, Just keep going forward. There's no chance you'll end up undergeared in an extremely difficult area. Yeah, for me this is a negative.-Dull sidequests.-Multiplayer is a joke.-Most weapons feel weightless. It's not a lightsaber dear devs, it's a two-meters-long halberd.-Game breaking bugs. In 18h of gameplay I had to alt-f4 the game 3 times because of a bug that blocks keyboard inputs. Apparently it's known since 10 months ago and it's still not fixed.-Asset recycling. In this game, this is brought up to the next level: you're going to find every enemy in the first 3 areas, then EVERYTHING ELSE will be a recolor or retexture of these same enemies. The attack patterns won't change either.-Complex maze maps for the sake of complex maze maps. Do you remember that sense of wonder when you completely explore an area in Dark Souls and suddenly everything comes together and makes sense? Well, there's none of that here. The maps are basically enhanced versions of those mazes for kids you find on paper tablecloths at McDonald's.-Wonky hitboxes. You can backstab a lot of enemies standing near their right or left legs, but not when you're actually behind them. Parry suffers from this too.-Artificial difficulty spikes. The game goes from 0 to 100 real quick in some encounters, but not in the good way: one moment you're oneshotting everything, the next you're being oneshot by extremely fast, barely telegraphed, high damaging AOE attacks. Clearing these encounters is devoid of any sense of accomplishment, because they're so cheap and poorly thought that you feel that a) you brute-forced through them b) RNG was on your side c) both of the above.TLDR: Code Vein is a watered down souls-like game with a generic anime façade and a very forgettable story. Buy it on sale.			"
Recommended,200.2,"																Great Animu Souls-like, more on the anime side than the souls-like part. The combat is rather easy with companions and can get a bit more challenging by going ""solo"". Leveling up is straight forward, you level up without assigning stats. When appliyin a class to the level, the stats are ""calculated"" so the player has no need to go around minmaxing stats, or making useless builds that cannot be reverted.The story is par for the course if you played god eater, and the exposition via memory shards is cool. 			"
Recommended,25.9,"																Overall good game, quite easy compared to the dark souls series due to having a companion, but richer in story. To me it's an attempt to merge JRPG artstyle and storytelling with souls like mechanisms.Combat is more versatile, but given the difficulty, there's really not much incentive to explore play styles. Also the move set of some bosses feel clunky - many bosses can be easily defeated in you stay behind them.The main story is much more detailed, and the overall tone is much more positive. Most characters have solid background stories, and these stories are introduced without breaking the flow of the game.Level design is fine - I got lost in quite a few maps, but overall, most maps are good - a few feel rushed, but not that much rushed.Side quests & depths are really boring. Skip unless you are after some achievements.Music is fantastic, both on its own and in terms of fit. This is partially due to the game being much more explicit in emotional expression and storytelling compares to souls games, allowing the music to be the same.Lastly, I really like Io, almost considered not finishing the game for her :/ Won't elaborate too much as it'll be spoilers otherwise, but I like her not being so much like human, but trying to become one - Human qua human.

Recommended,137.5,"																This one is....odd. Is it a Soulslike? Technically, yes. You have many of the same foundational elements, like limited resources that replenish at save points scattered around a zone, enemies that respawn when you use those save points, a single resource that is both your XP and your money, etc. (Also, gravity is as likely to kill you as the enemies are, if not more so...)Does it play like a Souls game? Not...exactly. Code Vein isn't as dynamic as a Souls game tends to be, nor does it have the same grit and weight to it. This game is VERY anime, in both good and bad ways, which can be a bit jarring if you expect to come into a Souls style experience.PROS-Gameplay: The game is actually fun. I don't really understand the claims that it was Bandai's ""cash grab attempt"" while Dark Souls was at its peak. I ended up playing the game the whole way through, and I'm playing it again with a friend. It's not one of my top ten games ever by any stretch, but I am a sucker for games that let you switch classes and learn abilities from each of them, so it worked well for that.-Characters: While the characters (both companions and other NPCs) may not be the super deep, they are at least well-written and likable for the most part. Their individual stories are honestly more compelling than the over-arching plot (which actually could be considered in-line with the Souls games too, I suppose.)-Music: The music in the game is actually quite beautiful. There are occasional moments where it's perhaps not the most fitting, but it is well done.CONS-Story: The story is...pretty weak. Individual character stories are pretty solid, and they do give you some additional details about the world in a somewhat similar vein to how item descriptions give lore in Souls games. The overall plot, however, basically starts off as ""Everything is bad"" and evolves into ""Here's how the bad works"" without really telling much of a story.-Character design: Alright look...Gamers are thirsty little degenerates. I get it, no judgment, I think most of us have those moments. Games like Dragon Age or Baldur's Gate 3 have romance options for a reason. That said, the fan service in this game is...a lot. It reaches a level of silly that kinda detracts from what's going on at times. You're navigating a dangerous world on the brink of collapse and there are multiple women who can go out and fight alongside you who have boobs each the size of their own heads being barely contained by tattered bits of cloth that only cover as much as is needed to keep this game from getting a higher ESRB rating. It's not really sexy so much as just kinda stupid.-Audio: The audio in the game can be kinda rough. The individual components are well done (music, voice acting, etc.) but they are mixed in ways that don't always work. The music will often swell and drown out the dialogue for which it's trying to set the mood. Cutscene audio, especially dialogue, has a tendency to stutter and lag. For the most part, it's nothing too heinous, though there was one scene that should have been a particularly poignant moment in which the cutscene and the audio fell so far out of sync, it was like stereotype of the old, foreign films that are dubbed so badly that no one's mouth is moving by the time the dialogue is heard.NEUTRAL POINTS WORTH MENTIONINGOne of the key factors that makes Code Vein quite different from other Soulslikes is the way attributes and leveling work. You don't put points directly into attributes like you do in many other games. Rather you have what basically amount to classes that will adjust your attributes when you equip them. Weapons and armor have specific attribute scores, as well as minimums you have to meet to use them, but otherwise are not class-locked. On the one hand, this is great because it means you can mix and match your gear to suit your playstyle. If you want to prioritize casting stats and use a fast weapon to build up your casting resource quickly, but wear a heavier armor, you can probably do that. If you want a big, hard-hitting weapon but otherwise want to stay light on your feet with lighter armor, you can make that work. The problem comes in when you try to match up your stats. Classes, weapons, and armor all have a scaled letter rating rather than a numeric value. The higher the ratings, the better you are with things that rely on that stat. So a class that has an A+ in Mind wearing armor that has a C in the same will be okay, but not as good as the same class wearing armor with an A or a B+ in Mind. This leads to you getting a lot of unnecessary information because weapons and armor will show ratings for all the stats generally...but they aren't actually using them all. For instance, if a weapon has high Strength and high Willpower scaling, attacks will land harder on classes that have good Strength scaling. The Willpower scaling, however, doesn't actually contribute to the weapon's damage unless it has some sort of secondary action like firing a projectile or unleashing a wave of energy on a heavy attack. Similarly, casting stats like Mind and Willpower on your armor combine with your class to determine how strong your abilities and spells are, but Strength and Dexterity scaling on armor only comes into play if/when you use drain attacks. It's not a terrible system, but it does feel clumsy at first, and cluttered even once you get used to it.***********All this to say, is the game worth playing? Sure. Does being a Souls/FromSoft fan mean you're gonna love this game? Not really. Is it the sort of game people new to the Soulslike genre should try if they're still getting a feel for things? Maybe, but take this one with a grain of salt, and maybe wait for it to go on sale.EDIT: corrected typos			"

Almost every single enemy has hyperarmour which is stupid.3. Most of the bosses in this game are borderline to completely broken and unbalanced.4.

Healing pace doesn't match with the speed of the game.7. Cathedral of the sacred blood is basically a joke.8. Too many levels with re-used assets and similar looking places resulting in getting lost easily.9. Most areas are ganky and don't really have a skill based challenge.10. The combat system itself feels 10 years behind from the overall graphics of the game.11, Certain areas aren't optimised properly leading to frame drops. This is evident in the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer Boss Fight Arena.12. Lack of diversity in enemy types.

Anti-Leak doesn't help, the sand will drain your ichor even if you use it.14.

Recommended,19.4,"																I've found so much joy in this game, as a noobie to the Bandai Namco franchise. The customisation is so unique (even though the selection controls may be laggy at times) and it's got more than plenty of options to choose from.After finishing the game twice, I honestly can't really understand what all the fuss is about. The story is great in my opinion, other reviews made me spooked that it was going to be very cliché but honestly it wasn't. Just because there's a friendship group doesn't mean that it's going to be My Little Pony-esque. ._. It's intrigueing as long as you capture and involve yourself in the story. Sure the endings were a bit strange, but they were interesting for a change. The gameplay itself is very grindy to get the achievements, as I'm a pesky achievement hunter and I'm still really struggling to get one of the most hardest goals yet which is to reach Companion Level 30. That is one feature that I really despise... It's super grueling to constantly die to the same boss over and over again knowing full well that most likely, you're going to have to spend another solid 100 hours to even get near gathering enough Marks (points) to reach the desired level.... It's even more difficult when there's no one Online to help you grind, since this is kind of a dead game. (Hmu if you're also struggling and fighting to get that achievement lol ;) That's pretty much the only real problem that I have with this game.EDIT: About the companion level 30 achievement, it takes MUCH less time to accomplish this if you've got somebody to play with. The fastest way that I've found to get Marks is to play on Depths: Tower of Trials I which accompanied with another player (along with the Revenant's Greed passive gift) grants you 10-12 marks with both defeated Bosses. I've finally reached it after luckily finding somebody to play with, so if you're struggling to find someone to play with, hmuHowever there is an annoying bug where Valuables vanish after interacting with certain charaters which is tedious, but I've managed to avoid that nuisance by simply pressing Esc, checking out my inventory with the valuables and then closing the tab to further interact with the rest of the characters.My final conclusion is that this game isn't going to be very fun for someone who prefers shooter-games with little to no story to it. But for someone like me who really enjoys a story telling in a different manner, I'd say you should give this game a shot!			"
Not Recommended,6.7,"																Welcome to the Robot Maid Review of Code VeinReviewer Notes:Controller used: Dualshock 4 (Sony Controller)Playthrough: Three playthroughs. No Enhanced Difficulty.Game Build: Build Current to 10/20/2019TL;DR at the bottom.Code Vein is Shift's effort into making an action RPG set in the ruined city known as the Vein, a ruined cityscape ravaged by unknown horrors and a frenzied monster known as ""the Queen"". You become a Revenant in this destroyed world and are thrust into hunting a food source for others like you before being found by the idealistic Louis into finding the source of food for all Revenants. Along with Louis, recruit and befriend other Revenants as you explore the city and fight off the Lost, Revenants who have lost themselves and prowl the land attack Revenants on sight. As you traverse the city, unlock the keys to not only your past, but the pasts of your friends, and those who came before you and learn the truth about the city and why it came to be, and why it remains as it does.Pros:Native full PS4 controller support (Button prompts included)Incredibly robust character creator.Strong gameplay with a lot freedom of choice on play style overall, making your character feel even more like your own.Great graphics and artstyle.Decent pacing overall.No bouncing off walls with attacks.Engaging story with great characters.New Game Plus.Multiple endings help replay value.AI partners are actually smart and useful, but are not necessary in case you want a higher difficulty.Cons:Combat can feel a bit clunky thanks to inability to change attack direction in some scenariosGame is a bit short (my first playthrough was around 32 hours, taking the time to find all items, complete all side quests, etc)Some minor moments of the game freezing during fights (may be my hardware)""Exalted Reputation"" Trophy takes too much time and basically necessitates you have a friend help you with it.Game slows down / halts experience gain for abilities if you are ""over leveled"" and is not inherently clear when this is the case.Some areas are frustrating.A fantastic game that I would argue is very much worth a 60 USD price tag, in spite of its general length being relatively short. It has a strong and coherent story and it all ties together rather nicely, no matter which ending you get. Many of the systems in the game only bolster it, and the ones that could be better are only an inconvenience at the very worst (such as co-op having the distress signal function as opposed to a lobby of some sort). If you're a fan of games in the genre, it's most definitely worth a buy.TL;DRGreat game, worth 60 USD. Character creator is one of the strongest I've seen in a game yet. Io is best girl, I will fight people who say otherwise.			"
Recommended,21.6,"																Tl;dr I wish there was a neutral or medium review option.If you're a hardcore anime fan, love JRPG's, and love Japanese ARPG's this is for you and an easy pickup. If you're an absolutely hardcore Souls-like fan and want a game with a great aesthetic & serious tone then skip this. The anime aesthetics, for me, detract from the overall narrative. The gameplay is solid, but I think Nioh is more fun & interesting combat-wise for cheaper. Pros: -Gameplay is solid with a variety of weapon types. The combat is so solid that it's kept me returning. Feels like a Souls-game but slight faster. Fulfills that gameplay itch that Nioh can't quite scratch.-RPG mechanics such as statistics are deep and there is a lot of build options for different playstyles-Has a companion system if you can't get into co-op that you can opt out of-aesthetics are good, utilizing lots of reds and whites. This game makes concrete look good.-Good QoL such as a minimap that unlocks as you explore a level and area completion percentage-Bloodcode system essentially enables the player to switch classes during a playthrough at no cost.-NG+ system is perfect getting harder and harder each cycle until enemies 1-shot, you can also go down in difficulty back to pre-NG+ when you beat the game. -Magic system similar to Darksouls, but they're bit more like abilities from other series. A melee-type player would still want to use the magic, but you can forgo most of it. There's utility spells like healing your companion with part of your HP or decreasing/increasing stats. -Magick is combined with ichor system. Ichor can be regained by either using a utility item or by parrying/backstabbing rewarding doing them beyond extra damage. Cons: -Level design, enemy weapon animations, enemy placement, and many other aspects of the game ARE BASED AROUND THE COMPANION MECHANIC. This means that the levels will have far too many enemies for you to kite around and their attack range is incredibly wide. Due to this not using an AI companion nerfs you, this is /potentially/ good for experienced players but bad for new players who don't want to use the AI.-Level art is samey and the character designs feel samey and not over-the-top enough for the gothic style. I want near-naked dudes fighting too-Item statistics are conveyed poorly to the player. Too many numbers and not enough indication what they're doing. What does ""50"" attack defense or whatever actually mean or do? Is 50 a percentage? Is it good? Bad? A new player wouldn't be able to know this. -Keyboard gameplay is very poor. By default using the arrow keys and odd hotkeys like shift + a function key. Stick with controller.-Bad optimization. I have to run the game on the absolute lowest settings and it still becomes a fast-paced slideshow at some points. I've heard this applies to other players as well. Two of my friends can run the game well, but this is a port afaik so buy with caution.-Textures should be higher res for a 2019 PC release. Even on top settings the game just isn't as high-res as it should be.-Far too many reskinned items and weapons, this makes the loot seem bland and uninteresting. They even have similar movesets a lot of the time. I guess  this makes the non-reskinned loot one finds cooler, but afaik there's only four armor types that have slight dissimilarities. Again, this game is from 2019-or-whatever and it has less models in it than Dark Souls 1 or maybe even Demon's Souls.-Levels seem to be overly linear and lack real details. Most buildings are wrecked and so there isn't much exploration -Game has a lot of cutscenes & story moments which may make the game's intro feel slow to some players. Cutscenes expound much of the lore so without them you may be clueless wtf is happening. All cutscenes are skippable but still. -Game is just too easy on pre-NG+-Some enemies have homing attacks when they make absolutely no sense. For instance, the mantis lost have a jump attack that HOMES ON THE PLAYER or there's this sphere enemy that charges you but its charge is also homing. Homing attacks when they don't make any sense reward players for exact i-frame rolls and not skill & observation. As well, these mobs act outside of the player's abilities. I don't have any physical homing attack, why does the enemy? -Fourth level is a sewer level and the only meaningfully semi-non-linear level up to that point in the game. However, this level has the above homing enemies, water you have to w a d e through making you slower (you can remove this water but after fighting through it). The area is very similar looking so without the minimap this area would be a MASSIVE slog to get through. The final thing that makes it worse, it's a required level afaik. If this area wasn't required then it might be cool to make incursions through periodically, but the game needs you to progress through it. Finally, there's a cutscene in a part that makes it seem like you don't need TO BE IN THIS AREA which made it so I A) didn't finish the level B) didn't know where to go to proceed through the level. I had to wander around, until I realized that the next area was near where that cutscene fired T_T-Dying doesn't matterConclusion: This is a good game, but you have to be a certain kind of gamer to play it. I like it cus I'm a souls-fan but if this was turn-based I doubt I would have even bought it. I'll continue playing and if my thoughts change I'll update my review.			"

Recommended,6.7,"																My first Dark Souls like ever. Honestly I don't care about challenging games but according to some friends reviews, Code Vein is easier than other Souls series, so I gave a try and I really enjoyed it. A good ""RPG"" like that offers, a pretty and nice, character creation feature with a lot of customization options and with a plenty of cosmetic items.The game is quite large, I tried to do everything such as secondary quests and collect all vestiges. I dind't find all but it tooks me more than 40 hours to finish my first run. There is also a new game+ mode and you can do if to see one of the 3 ends (or watch on Youtube :D).Graphics are good, obviously not ultra beautiful as other AAA but it's enought. Anime style is well rendered. Some journalists dudes said that Code Vein is visually outdated but I'm not agree. I prefer games like this without 50 filters that make the game unrable.Gameplay is very similar to Dark Soul, save at mistle and spend earned XP points. So you won't be lost if you're used to play this kind of games. Explore maps, fight hard monsters and deafet boss. The game recquires time to get used to for beginners like me. Unlike other Dark Souls, you can choose play alone to increase the challenge or play with AI companion. This latter is really usefull in some cases and if it's not enought, you can ask for help and find an online player that will help you to defeat boss for example. Each AI companions have his own story. With unlocked and restored vestige (I'll talk about this latter), you see on an interactive cutscene which it shows the past of the companion. So will understand the story, and by the way, this latter is quite interesting. Futhermore the Code Vein lore is intriguing.As I said before the customization is big and good. There is a plenty of items with large variety of weapons and armors. Each category of weapons/armors have their own style. Big and slown but deadly swords/axes... Or fast weapons. Same for armors with light and heavy clothes with give you bonus/malus. You can improve the quality of items and also add some bonuses on spent XP points.The biggest features of Code Vein is the blood code system. After beating a boss or collected a certain amount of vestiges, you will acquires a blood code. Let's talk about vestiges first. There are located on the map, each vestiges is like shard of memory. In Code Vein, when people dies as vampires (or when they turn into vampire, I don't remember well), they lost their memories, vestiges help them to remember their pasts. You must gather a 2-3 vestiges to unlock other ones. For example, vestige D needs to have vesting A, B and C to be unlocked, etc.... Majority of vestiges are not mandatory to finish the game. Go back to blood code system. So after gathered vestiges, deafet boss, you will get a blood code and a blood code system is like a character class. So you can be a mage, a tank, a rogue, a ranged with ""firearms"" weapons and much more! So a code is really specific to class. For example, you can be a tank but you obviously need to wear heavy armor, and mage need light armor. Same goes for weapons, you can use and big 2 hands sword for mage but you won't deal any damages.Finally, the game will not suit for everyone. Some because they don't like anime style and other will say Code Vein is a sexist game (yeah for real), because the boss are most females with with ""attractive and big breasted"" body and females characters wear light clothes... But hey it's an ANIME game, not a realistic one.But for me I recommand Code Vein !			"
Not Recommended,1.8,"																Code Vein is a souls-like clone developed by the same publisher of Dark Souls, Bandai/Namco. It is set on the God Eater universe (games from same company) which I had no clue before touching the game but unlike its predecessors it plays like Dark Souls. During the game you have either the option to pair with one competent npc and cheese the game, sort of like Dark Souls phantoms or play solo like an actual chad. The choice is yours of course and you can always change the option on rest areas. Instead of being fully abstract there will be some comparisons here and there with Dark Souls since I find it very likely you have played at least one Souls title. Pros: Combat is very similar to Dark Souls but better. It is your typical stamina roll, block parry system. Is very fast paced and enemies are relentless, but as I mentioned do play solo. There are no cheese bow weapons sniping from the other side of the map, but instead you have bayonets that have limited range.There is a broad variety of classes, skills and weapons. Some classes are quite similar so there is redundancy here and there and you also use them just to be able to learn their abilities which you are able to equip to any class after. There are less weapon types than Dark souls such as fists, daggers, whips, rapiers.But the game makes up for these by having a plethora of skills that even melee classes can utilise properly, something that was not a thing on Dark Souls. Some of the classes also have their own special class lock skill which is quite possible to make a build around.Overall, there are much more builds you can make which promotes both replayability and adjustability on different encounters.The way to use gifts (spells) is also much more efficient than dark souls spells, since all you have to do is just hold same button and press another one corresponding as a shortcut for x, y, z gift. Unlike dark souls that if you have too many spells you have to scroll through each one of them until you find the one you want which is a chore that slows down combat...Each weapon has also a hold/charge attack sort of acts like dark souls special attack that some weapons had that depleted durability. Did I forget to mention Dark Souls in this paragraph? Go figure...The weapon UI has also been properly categorised for finding equipment easier. Swords/curved same category, halberds/spears same, axes/hammers same.There is also variety in animations between same type of weapons and a training dummy that you can test damage, and animations.Replayability is also one of the strongest points of the game. There are way too many builds. In dark souls you would go either full melee, full caster, hybrid caster, melee-caster and dot like poison. In code vein you can do what you want. You can make builds that endlessly hit and dodge by consuming health (Fionn), or builds focused around your charge attacks or your focus attacks.  You can also experiment  on same playthrough without having to reset stats like dark souls 2 for example.The difficulty varies a lot by using an npc or not. Having an npc is like easy mode but solo is a different gem. From all the souls-like games I have played Code Vein is the hardest solo. Bosses are unforgiving and patience is required. They have many mechanics, different animation attacks and a 2nd phase which adds more mechanics. Furthermore, they are not cheap gang bosses like 30% of dark souls 2 or cosmetic bosses of dark souls 1 which were pretty straightforward. A sound indication or a better pattern indication of what type of attack is about to come would help a lot though.Graphically the game is very pretty for its release time. Personally I like most areas but some lack proper graphical design direction such as cathedral which is copy paste all over. Some tunnels also reuse assets and many enemies are reskinned instead of improving enemy variety. Character creation is cool as well and in depth like an MMO new player screen, but there are flaws with some cosmetics where hair passes through hats for example. Skill animations are nicely done. I had no performance issues. I run a 1660 super/10600k at 1440p stable 60 fps and is buttery-smooth.Is it fun? Well totally subjective. It is fun for me, combat is way more fun and challenging than Dark Souls. If you can tolerate the npc dialogues and play it solo as it should be played imo. Playing with the npc makes the game ridiculously easy since you can cheese enemies, so I would advice against it.The cons:As soon as you enter your base, game throws too much information all from the get go.It doesn't try to be friendly with steady progression. A ton of trading valuable related things, upgrade materials, items and in general too much junk that you have no clue how and what it does. I don't know if directors had Onimusha 2, Way of the samurai or any MMO in mind, but who thought to add that crap trading system into the game? Pointless mechanic, literally open a walkthrough and trade valuables accordingly for max points. It also takes quite some time to farm these things to trade and I am not in favor of grind.The skills icons are black and white for some weird pseudo artistic reason that makes me forget what each does especially since you tend to change blood codes (classes) a lot and bind/unbind. Lack of color makes it harder to find them in menus although thankfully the UI is good and has categorised them into sub menus. I also refuse to believe it took them 5 years to make, some enemies are reskinned, cathedral is copy paste and tunnels use same assets. Unless they had other projects in parallel or team was inexperienced or understaffed, but companies tend to lie so no surprise there.The worse are the characters though. They are as cringe as it gets. Feels like I am watching a bad anime show or your typical poor written jrpg where everything is presented dramatically and all rational human behaviour has been tossed into the toilet. They don't act dumb, they just don't act quite natural I'd say. I personally didn't like how the recollection of old memories of your allies was presented. Felt like cutting corners to show proper animations. Also the way the voices sound inside the memories echoing accompanied with the same sad piano song playing, feels so forced that it gets comical instead. Cannot get to like any of the characters. The story is confusing as well, it is explained sort of, but helps if you know the setting of God Eater which I had to search. Poor story from Code Vein or no Story from Dark Souls with incomplete lore, pick your poison.Now the game copied many things from dark souls, even the invasions. But they didn't copy the best part, having the freedom of exploring any area disregarding difficulty. Every 3d souls-like clone does that...No idea why. It lacks the tossed into the wild element, being able to explore any area as soon as you start venturing into the unknown. It is mostly linear. You can revisit any part of any area you have previously been and also do some challenge instances. This is a general problem found on every souls-like clone and unfortunately is prevalent on Code Vein as well.Overall improvements:Cut the emo characters and pointless trading valuable system, explain the stats properly, ease up on information presented as soon as you start playing and allow actual non-linear exploration and you have an excellent game that can bring sequel after sequel.

I feel like a larger variety could be used.2 complaints from other reviews I didn't understand: 1. The labyrinths weren't really all that bad. (use. your. map). I mean, I did get stuck in one area once for a couple hours. Immediately after that it was fine.edit: Also I've discovered the source of these complaints. Iron Pineapple and other large content creators complained about it. You all need to have your own original thoughts. Content creators purposely play up these types of opinions for the views. The cathedral really wasn't that bad.2. And the companions really aren't that overpowered. If anything it feels like they scale just right.edit: Beat the game. Ending is a little disappointing.

Recommended,40,"																My first souls like game. Graphics are really great and of course character customization is one of the perfect thing in the game. Post apocalyptic world kind a swallow you inside of it. After long time during playing multiplayer games i tought i am done with all single player kind games but the curiosity kept me keep going on this game actaully little suprised that i finished the whole game. i dont think i can compare this game with other souls like games but it feels like way more easier than others because of companions helps you absurdly. Basically just take bosses attraction and try to dodge them while your companion kills it. This is why bosses were too easy for me. About the story it has described own world well. Over all it was good for my first souls like game. 7/10  But if you have played souls like games a lot, it may not satisfy you very much. (if you ever thinking to start to this game take good care of io. she is too pure for this universe :D)			"
Recommended,59,"																Interesting world with a neat backstory (but the way the story is told can be very repetitive); great support for Mouse & Keyboard (full customization of keybindings); interesting system for character ""build""; and a good, fluid gameplay for the most part.My only real strong complaint would be the Lock-On camera. It's fixed at a really bad angle that limits vision too much. Luckily you can get by without locking camera for the most part; I'm only locking it while using ranged attacks, and quickly unlocking it afterwards.			"
Not Recommended,31.9,"																Just to clarify, i have played through this game in solo mode without a companion. So my review is going to reflect the game from that point of view.Pros (+):+ Huge variety of character customization options+ Ability to switch your build to whatever you want at any time in the game. + Optional challanges, if you want to unlock additional gifts or codes.+ Gifts and other combat mechanics are niceCons(-):- Map design - some maps are horrendous to navigate in. Linear hallways leading you in a straight path, lots of reused textures making places look the same, which helps you get lost easily.- Annoying - placement of enemies; map gimmicks, reducing your stats and so on. I do not mind it from time to time, but in some areas I was like ""Oh boy, I am getting ambushed again. How surprising!""- Reskins of enemies - game reuses almost all enemies you can find with different colour and more stats.+/- Bosses - some of them are really nice and well done, some are straight up garbage. I think, if you will play with a companion, you might find them better, but for solo player, there are some bosses, that require absurd amount of skill or luck to beat (for average player).- You might miss some minor character developement for your allies, if you play solo only. Even though your allies are mostly saying only the generic lines, as you progress throughout the game, they will say some interesting things from time to time. (I would have not known this, if i was not informed by a friend)- The story has some interesting ideas, but mostly is bland and very predictable, there are few interesting characters, but usually their *jiggle jiggle* personalities are their most memorable traits.- Invasions- A lot of inspiration is taken from Dark Souls trilogy. Usually does not reach the quality level of DS.4/10 Wait for a big saleTLDR: Do not play this in solo mode unless you want some challange and annoyence in your life. With companion you might enjoy having a one hand free for other activities.			"
Recommended,218.8,"																[Note that I have played Dark Souls 3 an extensive amount and my opinion might be swayed by this][General]Code Vein is A Soulslike Action Rpg with an anime artstyle.It is set on a postapocalyptic earth, engulfed in miasma, where Revenants (Vampires who don't fully die) Are in the majority and humans are being exploited for their blood, whilst the options for Revenants to stave off their thirst are dwindling.Should a revenant not drink for long enough they lose themselves and join the hordes of lost scattered throughout the game world.It has a coop mode but includes no PvP.Each revenant possesses a bloodcode, which serves as somewhat of a character class.The player is different in a way that lets them access multiple bloodcodes and even pick up the bloodcodes from other revenants.  Abilities in these bloodcodes can be purchased and when they are used in battle for a certain amount of kills they become useable in any bloodcodes meeting the stat requirements. Bloodcodes alone govern stats like mobility, carry weight and damage/hp/resistance stats and your ichor capacity. Your level raises your health, stamina and weapon damage.Blood veils are the only armor slot available to the player in Code Vein.They have scaling with different stats and affect carry weight aswell as your abilities.Bloodveils aswell as weapons can be upgraded up to a max. of 10 at the cost of ressources and haze.[Story]The story is original and can at times become emotional. The impact of some moments however seems lacking due to an almost complete abscence of harm to the main cast of characters aswell as a lack of gore which might have helped to intensify especially the start of the game where the world makes its first impression on the player and you confront your first lost in the world whilst travelling with Oliver  F . Most of the characters get a fleshed out backstory through collectibles in the game, presented to the player with illustrations and voice segments.[Combat] The combat is compareable to the souls series in the basic ways, however abilities and the ressources tied to them, aswell as the focus meter give the game a more heavy rpg feeling without cutting much of the action.Your abilities which include buffs, removal of harmful effects, ranged damage, special moves restricted to weapon types all are classified as either dark or light, determining their scaling with the according stats. Abilities might have a stat required to cast them.Abilities cost Ichor, a ressource which is awarded for a successful drain attack.Parrying, Backstabbing and holding and releasing the according button will perform a drain attack with your blood veil.Blood veils also determine the type of drain attack you have access too aswell as your parry window.All this overall makes the combat a deep and customizeable experience, offering options for 1on1 combat and fighting larger groups aswell. The combat feels fluid and rewards players for successful dodging, managing their ressources and having put thought into their build and feels balanced between a good few playstyles, due to the fact that if a bloodcode might have bad stats, you can still use its abilities with another bloodcode equipped.Throughout the game you are allowed to have an npc companian, which makes the game a lot easier as these deal good damage, have access to the spells in their blode code and possess the ability to revive the player, aswell as having abilities which the player can use with the follower present.[Soundtrack & Voiceacting]The soundtrack consists of a variety of different moods. The emotions portraied are mostly really intense, which can feel awkward at times when something bad happens to a character you just met five seconds ago, yet the soundtrack makes it seem like a lost loved one has returned from being thought dead and is now dying for real after a brief but heartwarming, emotional reunion with his wife, 4 children and 15 grandchildren who all fall deathly sick because of this.[Graphics & Performance]The look of this game is mostly average with a heavy focus being on the artstyle and particle effects. The areas mostly look good even though some of the areas, especially Anime Londor , feel like they have a lot of repeating textures. Each area feels at least diverse and at most completely different from the last, including some environmental hazards one might expect within the context of the situation.Some enemies look like exactly what you would expect from the storyline whilst others look and feel original and well crafted.i7 7700k, 1070 with 8GB VRAM, 16GB RAM (8 should be cool) pulls a stable 60 fps at 1080p high graphics settings (AA turned down)This game seems to randomly lose connection at times, about every few hours, however this could be an unrelated issue.Coop seems fine in terms of latency until you  start covering larger distances, fine but a little worse than average.[Personal Verdict]I really ejnoyed my first playthrough and have already started another, the deep character & loadout customisation aswell as the mastery of combat are the factors that most stand out to me in this game and new game plus seems to really be a step up with the optional difficulty added. Even though I have bought it at a 25€ I would definetly pay full price for the experience.			"

Recommended,2.8,"																i absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVE this game. The story is top-tier, the only one that's managed to make me genuinely sob in years. it's Souls-like combat but better, because there's a mechanic called Ichor, which allows you to use your buffs and big boy moves and spells and all that cool ♥♥♥♥. The environments are perfect, ranging from a ruined city, to a giant cathedral, to a sunken city, to a desert. The characters actually feel like people, and the antagonists feel like people with their own motives as well. the bosses are on par (except the butterfly, ♥♥♥♥ the butterfly). also, the character creator is THE BEST CHARACTER CREATOR IN ANY GAME EVER MADE EVER AND I WILL BET MONEY ON THAT. also instead of having boring skill specs, you get things called blood codes, blood codes with their own predetermined stats, like one having A+ in strength and less in other areas, stuff like that. each blood code has their own story about the owner of the blood code, and each one has their own unique abilities and skills, which allows for endless build combinations. the armor also different from other souls-likes, because there are 4 categories: Ogre (fast and dexeterity focused typically), hounds which are more for strength orientated and have higher defense, Spine (or something i forgot i don't use it) which aren't all that great, and thorn, which are mainly intelligence and willpower focused. each time of armor has a different parry window, with the fastest being ogre and the slowest being thorn. each time you parry you can do a drain attack, which gives you a ton of ichor and increases your maximum ichor limit until you touch a mistle (bonfire or grace basically) buy this game, it's awesome			"

Recommended,6.5,"																Finished Code Vein on PS4 and have a lot to say about it. In a word, it is a mediocre imitator of Dark Souls with no drastic structural differences, while each of its game design aspects is not strong. If your favorite Soulsborne game is 10/10, then Code Vein might be a 6/10. Repetitive and Loose Combat There are limited types of enemies considering the game’s length. However, that is not the biggest problem. The general way of designing enemies makes different kinds of enemies feels similar. The enemy design abuses slow attacks that you must use defensive actions like dodge and parry to counter. Almost every move of every enemy has this characteristic no matter its shape, so the defensive side of combat is basically repetitive slow wait-and-dodge no matter your mastery. The enemy action pace and pattern are simply too monotonous and not creative.Another big problem is the encounter design. The game forces you to fight multiple enemies simultaneously in so many encounters, and all the enemies have the same speed. You can’t turn the encounter to multiple 1vs1 encounters. In these cases, the combat is either unfairly risky engagement or tedious hit & run. Though you don’t have to suffer this since you can have NPC partners who drastically ease the game, the combat can easily turn to mindless strikes with these NPCs. A considerable number of encounters fail to provide tight toe-to-toe combat experience no matter the way you play. Good Character Build System with Okay Skill Design The character build system is the biggest shining point of this game. You can equip one blood code which sets the general play style and build your character around it with eight active skills and four passive skills from hundreds of options. This system provided the potential for various playstyles, and it sure did. However, the pity is that you can’t find many skills that feel unique and special, while most of them are just boost your character’s stats in different ways and shoot different elemental projectiles. Rich Narrative Content with Homogeneous Themes The game put a lot of effort into telling the stories of different characters. When you acquire a skill, you will walk through a short memory of the corresponding character, and gradually discover their histories and intertwining relationships. However, the stories themselves have similar and limited themes, which are mainly about friendship, suffering, and sacrifices. The stories are just too homogeneous regarding the number of characters, which only makes them not impressive. Levels Are Monotonous, Fragmentized, And Artificial I would say Level Design is the worst part of this game. The layouts are repetitive, and each area is constructed by many sinuous fragments with limited connection. There are shortcuts, but they are only meaningful in the fragments to which they belong. The levels are not integrated at all that you are only forced to finish complicated routes. There is no environmental storytelling that most places feel empty and artificial. There is nothing interesting to discover besides collectibles and checkpoints. The level design makes the game world not intriguing at all.  Summary Code Vein doesn’t make fatal mistakes, but none of its parts is impressive. The whole game feels perfunctory and far from a game that can be considered great even it imitated one of the best game series in this generation.			"

Recommended,33.3,"																Being able to play a game with a friend has always meant a lot to me and I seriously don't understand why the developers have made a multiplayer system so buggy and complicated so the players cannot enjoy the game together most of the time, it's one of the key factors of any game to be enjoyable and remembered, but, unfortunately, this games loves to see you alone.First I must say that this game must stop identifying itself as a game with coop elements because they just don't work the way they should:1) The game supports only two players at a time, even though other soul-like games usually support up to 4 players. A lot of players have signed a petition that asks the devs to add the third playable human player, it's been already a year and the devs don't seem to care2) In 29 cases from 30 you won't be able to connect to your friend by receiving a distress signal, it just tells you that there's no such signal and there's no one to connect to3) As many users notice on the Internet, you and your friend have to be from the same... DOWNLOAD region, to be able to connect to each other! which is just ridiculous!4) From the Steam interface you can see that you can invite your friend to your lobby or join their game, but on practice this game never reacts to the requests made by Steam, it just ignores them5) Even if you go thru all this hell with connection, you won't be able to play all the game together because only the host player will be making progress in the game and the other one will have to complete the same levels again on their own to keep up with the host. Also if you die, the connection is lost, and you have to send/receive the signal again.Also, this game doesn't cost its price, if you just want a soul-like game with an interesting combat, plot and multiplayer system then play Remnant: From the Ashes instead, it's way much better and, more over, cheaper. The only reason to buy this game is if you love the anime style games or already has played the mentioned game, there's no other reason.			"
Recommended,60.1,"																If you like the combat depth of FromSoft Souls or Nioh, you won't like this game. The combat and weapon variety is a little dull, the leveling system is very surface level and zones are not very interesting.Leveling:When you use points to level, you cannot allocate them to specific stats, you just raise your level.To change specific stats you must change Blood Code. These are almost like classes and can be changed whenever.Each Blood Code comes with active and passive abilities called Gifts. To get more Gifts you must find memories, sit through multiple cutscenes, and then master that gift the same way everytime: kill an enemy.Story:The story could be more interesting but it didn't captivate me at all. The game is overflowing with long cutscenes that really pulls you out of the gameplay. It got to the point where I skipped everything just so I could play the game.Combat:As I said, very shallow. The weapon variety is somewhat lacking. The weapon abilities aren't very varied either. Most enemies can be killed with a backstab and a smack. Adding status effects to your weapons are usually useless as they don't affect bosses much and you'll usually kill normal enemies before the status effect even works.Enemies:There is some variety here but in the late game they're mostly reskins of earlier enemies. Most of them aren't very tough which is a strong contrast to the bosses which can be tough or annoying.To reiterate, if you like the Souls series you probably won't like this game. If you find the Souls games too challenging, you may enjoy this game.			"
Recommended,63.4,"																Extremely overrated game, I enjoyed the character customization, the music and the online mode, but that's it, nothing really shines about this game and makes it outstanding, it's repetitive and gets boring real fast, the combat mechanics are bad and the boss fights are dull. I was intrigued by the story at first but later on, it just got weak. It's a shame because Code Vein seems to have everything a souls-like fan would like but it's just not executed well in my opinion. Nevertheless, it's not a terrible game, just very average, I'd only recommend it if you have an itch for a new souls-like game and you ran out of options, other than that, I wouldn't, especially if you have big expectations and think that this is going to be nearly as good as Dark Souls.			"
Recommended,68.1,"																This game has stunning Visuals in my opinion and the choice of Soundtracks they choose for the areas are just fitting and beautiful, the story is Interesting and the Character customisation is pretty good, not the best but pretty good.I'd say the game is worth it and that it's connected to the  God Eater story/universe  makes it even better.If you like the games God Eater, Souls series and anything close to it, you may like this game aswell, I recommend it.			"
Recommended,132.3,"																Overall, this game has nothing new to offer over other souls like games. The main benefits here are that it's perfectly OK and has good character customization. It's a game that you play just to play, and if it weren't for the character customization (huge selling point for me) I wouldn't have made it past the first hour of this game.Pros-Good character customization-Acceptable souls-like gameplay. (Nothing particularly innovative)-You can't really screw yourself over by leveling incorrectly.-For those that find souls games frustratingly hard, the AI makes this game easier and it is optional to play with one.-You can alt-tab out of the game and still play with a controller. (you will absolutely want to multitask at points in this game)Cons-The customization is almost entirely limited to the face and hair. There are very few outfits and you can't do something as simple as equip different combinations of shirts/pants/shoes. Your face, which is mostly what you can customize, is perpetually covered by a gas mask. Use mods to remove it.-The story often is frustratingly pointless and insanely boring. The characters have completely flat personalities.-The multiplayer takes the worst parts of dark souls and makes it even worse by not even having pvp. The co-op is extremely inaccessible and you will jump through hoops just to play with a friend.-The level design can be boring, confusing and frustrating to the point where I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people dropped the game at certain points because of it. You will have to look over every single ledge in the entire game in order to find the path you're supposed to go because everything is hidden for no reason.I personally wouldn't recommend this game, but if you're on the fence and you want something to play and this looks like something you'd enjoy, go for it.

Recommended,55.4,"																[TL;DR at the bottom] Code Vein is a story driven action RPG which attempts to set itself apart from other “Souls-like” games through heavier focus on character build variety, story narration and customization rather than world building or atmosphere.The game generally ran pretty smoothly for me throughout my initial 30 hour playthrough. This includes all side quests, the true ending, the optional depths dungeons, a good few hours of multiplayer and a about three hours in the character creation. While I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, there were some annoyances including graphical glitches that were isolated to a single area, achievements not unlocking properly, rare but intense lags and a single crash to desktop. I suspect that both the lag and my crash were related to excessive alt-tabbing but Code Vein still has some performance issues when switching areas outside of teleporting, which as far as I am aware is present for everyone due to how the game loads its assets. While the player-pool seems rather small at this point, whenever I did find people to Coop with, there were no issues in connectivity, aside from some sketchiness in how the game recognizes backstabs.Code Vein is probably most well known for its extensive character customization. This is also very much comparable to the series it draws most of its story inspiration from: God Eater. Clothes, Accessories and a whole lot of detail is available despite surprisingly rather limited facial customization. Something that extends more broadly into weapon and armor choices as well. Armor is generally divided into four categories, each having their own minor gameplay implications with only a handful of models available for each type. The same holds true for weapons, wherein only a few unique weapons stood out for their gimmicks in either moveset or scaling. Following these limitations is that rather through your equipment choices, gameplay is instead dictated through a large variety of Blood Codes – essentially Classes that bundle a bunch of possible Skills/Spells than can individually be mapped to eight quickslots and can largely be used independently of the Blood Code (Class) once you gather a bunch of experience while having them equipped. The fact that the game rewards you by unlocking most of these skills permanently for other classes incentivizes a lot of experimentation and is CV's strongest point, as it's pretty exciting to jump from build to build and not needing to feel like you may gimp your character while doing so. Combat is further defined by the game generally expecting you to play with one of six AI companions (+1 additional player in Coop) and leads to it being very fast paced and buff focused as any support skills tend to count towards the entire party rather than just your own character. This can be a bit hit or miss for many players who may expect a bit more methodical gameplay from their experiences with other similar titles but plays into the strengths of build variety that have been touched upon earlier. The AI proved to be super competent too and none of the companions I used ever got stuck on terrain, randomly fell to their deaths or otherwise. All in all they seemed to be the most balanced part of the game, whereas the player character eventually begins to out-scale enemies, eliminating some of the initial difficulty of the game.Instead of environmental storytelling that is much more present in the Souls games, Code Vein opts for more traditional and linear story telling that ended up more engaging than I expected. It is heavily implied to share a universe with the God Eater series, which I played but never enjoyed. So it was extremely surprising when Code Vein managed to keep me hooked even through the more cliched parts of it that many may expect from seeing the masked anime vampires on the cover. This is heavily supported by the generally outstanding soundtrack, though a few tracks tend to repeat a little too often and may become jarring over multiple playthroughs.By far the greatest weakness of the game is its map design, which tends to both be even more linear than the Souls games as well as heavily reliant on questionable gimmicks. The most prominent example easily being the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, which is a messy multi-layer maze of extremely similar looking architecture, but also extends into some later areas as well. A snow mountain, which has a tendency to let you drop to your immediate death, or a burning city that features plenty of constant ticking damage. Those serve more to annoy than to prove challenging and an exciting obstacle to overcome. TL;DR+ Fast paced and flexible combat system through skill variety+ Generally extensive character customization+ NG+ and post-game content + Generally high quality graphic- and sound design, eclipsing similar anime themed titles+ Decent attention to detail (e.g. design of the Hub area) and understanding of the target audience (e.g. photo mode to support the rich character customization)+ Successor of the Milkers+/- Story pacing somewhat tied to player action: Character backstories are largely explored through viewing their memories, which the player can view at will once collected. Putting those off for an extended period of time may prove to be fairly boring to catch up on and incentivize skipping them entirely+/- Some story implications depend on getting the fairly easily missable True Ending and possibly prior knowledge about the God Eater universe+/- Online functionality limited to Coop+/- Decent, though majority cosmetic mod support+/- Difficulty largely balanced around the competent companion AI- Some abilities and stats are poorly explained (e.g. A skill may read that lowering your weight will increase your damage but not specify by how much.)- Lackluster sidequests that barely serve any purpose in both overarching story or gameplay- Fairly limited enemy variety. Some common types repeat throughout each and every area of the game. Bosses feel similarly lacking both aesthetically and in presentation. Especially the True End may consequently feel anticlimactic.- Map/Level design is at times overly reliant on annoying gimmicks- Ultimately a cliffhanger ending that so far has only been followed up on through extremely questionable DLCI don't think comparing Code Vein to the Souls series is fair. While the general gist of the gameplay does remain similar, the hard focus on actual skills and classes is simply too different from the more static gear and raw stat focused approach of the Souls series. Likewise, while I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending Souls titles on the basis of their story, I can comfortably do so with Code Vein, as long as people can appreciate the anime aesthetic. As they should.			"

Recommended,"2,320.60","																Spent almost 3 hours just making a character and the character (not just mine, all of them) look awesome. Game so far feels smooth and plays great, very happy with the game right now.**UPDATE**-A note about the controls:Lots of people are recommending to play with a controller which I can also recommend but I will also add that it is not difficult to get behind the keyboard and mouse layout. To those intimidated by the ones saying this is a deal breaker and makes the game awful, it isn't. The first 5 minutes in it will seem a bit overwhelming but 10 minutes later I promise you that you will be fine with the keyboard and mouse controls. You only need a barely decent memory to comfortably get behind the controls (for gifts and some special actions). But a controller indeed will be a bit easier to pick up and easier to learn, either way, BOTH are absolutely playable. -Gameplay and Performance:So far it is great. The combat is nice and fluid (and very pretty I might add). It isn't the craziest combat system out there but it is a very good combat system at that. If you are looking for DMC or Ninja Gaiden-type combat, this game won't satisfy you, but if you are familiar with any of the souls series this will be right up your alley. As far as performance goes, I have not run into any FPS drops, stuttering or lag spikes and the great thing is that this game will only keep improving overtime. -Sidethoughts:Some people are complaining that the walking is slow and awkward. I appreciate beautiful art and scenery (which this game has plenty of) so the traveling speed is totally fine for me and will be for most others. It does not feel slow or awkward at all. And for those Petty Roosevelts out there, you can sprint, maybe not forever but it helps and is not a gamechanger or deal breaker for this game. -FINAL THOUGHTS:Without spoiling a bunch, the game is a heck of a lot of fun, if you are thinking about getting it, don't hesitate especially if you've got a buddy to play with which always makes things more fun. I am very happy with my $60 purchase, but that being said I am biased as I have been waiting for this game to release since it was first revealed years ago.

Boring story, repetitive levels, where you either climb ladders, or search for a way to jump down, cliche characters, unchallenging enemies, and rather disappointing and forgettable bosses.Dialogues, and character interactions made me feel second-hand embarrassment (to avoid calling it cringe). The worst parts were probably looking into memories of other Revenants, which were just boring, and didn't really keep me engaged nor interested.About building your character, I was really disappointed that most of the blood codes (skill trees) are useless, and just worse than others. I hate that there's a system that won't let me wear X armor, because my chosen blood code has too little of Y stat. What I liked were the skills, that really gave me that 'anime-game-feeling'. The character creation wasn't bad either in my opinion.

Recommended,54.3,"																With almost 20 hours of playtime, i decided that it was time to write a Review.-i refuse to compare this game to the Soulsborne series, and refuse to call this game a clone of that franchise-Code Vein is a spin-off of the God Eater franchise.Design and Gameplay are very similar to what you usually find in the God Eater universe, with strong anime-vibes in and outside of sometimes lengthy cutscenes.There is alot of Story to the main game, a decent amount of character building and development, as well as Character interactions in various ways.You can pick from a growing variety of friendly Characters to fight and explore alongside you, or you can choose to play solo. (additionally, you have the option to call or be called by another player, to help them, or receive help from them)Code Vein is a very linear game, but offers enough freedom for exploration in it's interconnected dungeon world system.With Story out of the way, let's dive into Gameplay.Gameplay in Code Vein is very similar to what you find in a God Eater game, but it also brings numerous new additions to the table aswell.instead of classes, you get Blood Codes.Each Blood Code alters your stats differently, some raise your mind and dextery, while others raise stamina and strength for example.They also come with different Gifts, those being spells basically.There are passive skills / spells you can equip as a perk, and you have active ones that buff you or shoot lightning / fire at your enemies.Most of these Gifts can be leveled up by being used, and inherited permanently, allowing you to use them with all other Blood Codes (classes).Furthermore, depending on the Weapontype you use, and the Vestment you wear, your stats will be altered further.Weapons and Vests can be upgraded, or have certain elements added to them, like ice or poison damage.Just like in God Eater, you will face huge and strong Bosses, and some other smaller fries to kill.The design is very similar to God Eater when it comes to enemy types and bosses, but offers unique designs just as much at the same time.Unfortunately, Music only plays when you fight a Boss or battle a few regular mobs, then stops altogether again.Every Area is unique and usually has new enemy types waiting for you to discover and learn them.Character Customization is very deep and offers a very huge variety of options and custom placing of accessoires etc.Hairstyle, Make up, Clothing, Wristbands, Gloves, Chains, Masks, all of that stuff is there in a huge variety and can be customized to every and any liking.You get to pick from serveral voices to use, you can play the game in either Japanese or English voice-over, you can use Emotes customized with different spoken Lines and Stamps for when you play with a friend or another player in general, and there is still alot more here to be indulged in.There is not much to say about performance, other than that it runs very smooth and well optimized from what i experienced. There are a decent variety of graphics options to adjust to your needs.definitely one of the better ports out there.If you like exploration, challenges that don't push you too hard, a compelling anime storyline with lots of interesting characters, and gameplay that offers alot of individuality and customization, and if you enjoyed and liked God Eater, you should give this game a chance.I love this game, and next to Astral Chain, it's one of my favourite releases this year.I fully recommend this game to people that don't hate anime, and can see a game for what it is, instead of judging it for what it is not.

Recommended,43.4,"																Ok so the the basis or the targeted audience for this review will be fans of souls or anything fromsoftware. If you're ONLY buying this game because you need to satisfy your dark souls itch, I would not recommend this game. It's just not up to par with the standards i've developed from playing souls games. The combat in it's entirety is far too stiff, attacks are stiff, moving your characters around is stiff in general. Exploration is completely tedious, every area is the same thing, get key, open this doorm rinse and repeat. There's no actual brilliant level design. You're not exploring to find amazing weapons or traverse through areas to find something new. Your exploration is limited to finding a key to a door. The companion aspect is pretty interesting, and I appreciate it in the sense that it's a new idea but it's executed terribly. Having a companion isn't fun, or adds anything to the gameplay experience. You just watch your companion distract enemies while you absolutely destroy them. It's not indicative of anything other than adding a brand new idea that doesn't add crap to your gameplay experience. The companion hardly talks, you don't get cool bonuses for using them. They're just there to make things easier for you. So for that, the companion aspect of the game is complete trash. The story is pretty anime, and I like anime, but not with video games when you have so little time to develop characters and most of the time was spent on developing other aspects like combat. The story is just complete anime bs, and maybe if you like that then you'll love this game, If you want to play this game because you're in that category of weeb then this is exactly what you want because the character creation is so wide in that sense because you can make yourself any anime girl you want and you can coom to her. I could also recommend this to people that find dark souls too hard and you want to play the discounted version of it. I can't recommend this to a general dark souls fan, it's just not polished enough to make it even worth as a means to satisfy an itch. As a game, it isn't too good either. But like I said, if you like anime and spending 5 hours in character creation then this will be your jam.			"
Recommended,30.6,"																Do you like Dark Souls?Do you like Anime?Well if you liked at least one of these things, Code Vein is the game for you!First thing I would like to clear up is this whole 'Code Vein is Anime Dark Souls' thing, because it's... It's really not. Yes it feels very soulsborne gameplay wise, yes it is more difficult than most games at times and yes the resources are handled very similar to Dark Souls, but is it truly just Anime Dark Souls? Eh... No.Dark Souls almost always emphasizes two main features - patterns and very specific hitboxes and both are very unforgiving if you do not respect them. Code Vein is a lot more forgiving in these areas. You can play this game however you want but unless you are a completionist it isn't much harder than games like Skyrim especially when you consider just how generous the NPC's are at times.The main difference in experience a completionist will feel from a regular player is that the best way to max out high level gear is to NOT level up making a lot of the fights very difficult if you don't have good mechanics or haven't upgraded your weapons. There's a lot of reasons why this works that way but I won't go into it.The main take away is if you're looking for a game to play semi-casually and still want a bit of a challenge Code Vein is a pretty good pick up. It even has the added bonus of having a multiplayer feature to play together with friends.Sure there are a few frustrating bugs here and there (sometimes not being able to exit out of the shopkeepers inventory and having to restart the game) but those are rare and nothing too gamebreaking. The overall experience is nice and enjoyable and the story is pretty simple and straight forward to follow, unlike Dark Souls which often times calls for a lot of searching for hidden lore and connections.Code Vein is it's own game and stands on its own feet and it does it remarkably well (so far).There are some mechanics in the game for more hardcore players like parrying and specific builds but do you need to master those in order to enjoy the game? Not really.Then again at this point I'm pretty early in the game so if I said anything wrong...Well that's on Atcheng so go complain to him.			"

Not Recommended,27,"																Tons of people have broken down what the game is and isn't so I'll try to explore what it is about the game that kept me interested, and hopefully it'll help anybody reading make a decision for themselves.  I just wrapped up the game at about 24 hours played and I gotta say, this game exceeded my expectations, which were admittedly not that high.  For starters, I couldn't put the game down.  It's extremely unlike me to play one game this much in so few sittings.  It's hard to say what it was that hooked me with this one, it's like the game is greater than the sum of its parts.  Everything here is, in a word, ""fine"".  Here's hoping I discover what it is while writing this review!The story is good enough to keep you interested as long as you like cliche anime drama (it's well executed, but very cliche in its characterization and themes).  The combat is well done, but enemies are often too easy to beat.  Some boss fights are clever and challenging, some are way too easy, a couple may take a few tries, but none of them really stand out as anything incredible.  So how did all of these seemingly mediocre things keep me hooked?  If I had to take a stab at it, I'd guess it's the consistency of the experience and the clear expectations it has of the player, combined with the ""no bad choices"" game systems design.  This game isn't necessarily easy, but it's still a ""chill"" experience.  Does specing into a heavy build sound fun?  Try it out, see how you like it, you can change it later at no penalty.  Nervous about using that consumable?  No sweat, you can buy more easily at the base.  Oh, you're at a boss, when should you use your humanity for multiplayer?  Nah, not a problem, you can always play multiplayer for that helping hand.  Screw up and die?  Your AI buddy can probably revive you (not as broken as it sounds).  The game isn't nearly as punishing as other souls-like games, without compromising too severely on the difficulty front that keeps this genre engaging.  That said, if you're the type of person to throw every game on the highest difficulty and don't have fun otherwise, this game likely won't float your boat.Let's go over some quality of life stuff this game does well.  The map is amazing.  The way it keeps track of where you've been and when you've been there is easy to read at a glance and so immensely helpful.  The game has some truly labyrinthine areas, but the map makes them manageable at the very least, and if you're like me, even kinda fun.  I wish the map had elevation levels you could swap between, but it wasn't much of an issue for the most part.  Little quality of life things from souls games are here as well, like items automatically going to storage and refilling at ""bonfires"".  For the most part, there won't be any menu related things that irritate you.To continue on with this scatterbrained review at 6 AM, let's talk about why the story was engaging to me, and it's not necessarily for the storyline, though it is a contributing factor.  This might be a bit controversial, but I like the JRPG trope where the protagonist loses their memory.  It's not interesting from a character development perspective, but it's an easy way for writers to reveal information at engaging moments and flesh out the world in a way that feels organic for the player.  A big chunk of the story is told through memory fragments that you pick up when exploring, which also grant new abilities, which also tend to be near good loot in the levels, and usually to find all of the fragments you have to 100% complete an area.  Every facet of the game is tied together through this mechanic, effectively making you *want* to 100% the game.  Whether you are interested in the anime melodrama or not, the story is still the driving force here, at all times, in an organic way (and if you don't want the melodrama, every cutscene is skippable).TL;DR, every system in the game is tied together in a satisfying way.  The game doesn't try to waste your time.  It respects you, the player and doesn't make the game harder if you are bad.  It tells a well executed, if cliche, story with plenty of lore to dive into if you care.  It doesn't limit how much you can play with a friend if that's what you want to do.  There's a wide variety of builds possible, and you can experiment with them all without losing the min-max experience.  This isn't the best game ever made, but it's a competent and focused game.  Hopefully this helps somebody out there.  If it did, feel free to leave a comment and let me know I didn't waste my time, it would be appreciated (even if it made you decide not to buy it).			"

Recommended,12.1,"																Wait for it to be at least 25% off before you buy. I reached the ending of the base game and it is not worth the full asking price. I've tried to keep spoilers in this review to a minimum     The game suffers from a minor frame rate issue, mainly when transitioning between areas. This will usually fix itself before it becomes a gameplay issue.     The art style does its job well and the character creator gives you a level of customisation I haven't seen any other game come close to in this genre.      Online co-op felt good, I never once lagged or disconnected during my time spent with it, load times were quick and the password filter works well. My only complaint with this aspect is that if both the host and the human companion go down at the same time, the AI companion will revive whoever is closer to them, this would mean the helper being revived instead of the host, which meant a game over. The need for communication is low and the mixture of gestures, stamps and voice lines cover your bases. Also, give us a grace period after beating the boss, I want to celebrate our victory!       **People have reported that there are bugs with the multiplayer that have to do with your steam region.**     The game's combat feels sluggish and at times unresponsive, in-particular the 'ranged' combat with the bayonet feels terrible and just boils down to you buffing before a fight and proceeding to stand-in-place and spamming the same button whilst your companion takes aggro. I ended up switching to a melee build near the end of the game because the ranged playstyle was so lacking. The melee combat wasn't much better and it boiled down to me using  Jack/Louis'  unique buff to beat down the boss, but at least I was dealing more damage without being gimped by my ichor supply. All other strats I tried just left me fighting a sack of hit-points. I can only imagine how dull combat would have been had i not kept upgrading my weapon.    Every boss aside from a select few is some variant of a 'dude in armour' (generic boss design) and doesn't do enough to distinguish themselves from the rest in terms of fight design. Every boss has a quick, long-range charge, every boss has a 'get away from me' aoe and every boss has some form of roll-catcher combo with the later bosses having a room-wide attack with no attempt made to disguise any of these moves as something more; to differentiate them from their counterparts or have a unique twist put on them. Unique boss moves are a rare commodity.    The level design ranges from mediocre to terrible, the  waterlogged and cathedral city      areas are some of the worst I've experienced in a long time. I enjoyed the interior of the  cathedral 	 and it was one of the game's highlights.     Its attempt at making the companions that travel with you feel more than just a faceless NPC fall flat every time and ended up being annoying, I looked through the menus multiple times looking for a way to turn off or lessen their chatter. Every companion will  ALWAYS  make the same, most surface-level comment on the environment and enemy encounters as every other companion, had it not been for their voices ringing through my ears every second I would not have noticed any difference between the cast.     The main-story cutscenes and lore I did sit through were boring and led to me just skipping them entirely after I reached the 1/3 mark of the game. What qualified for serious and sad moments had me laughing all the way through.      I skipped all the optional lore sections/cutscenes because if your main story is that bad then I dread what your side stories are going to be like. They also lock some of the Blood Codes' (classes') abilities behind these side story cutscenes.     The soundtrack is serviceable. A few songs were good, but nothing to write home about, I found myself putting on a youtube playlist while playing.     Overall the game is lazy and it feels like they have tried to hide it by pulling out a bunch of fan service and tropes. The developers are relying on the art style to carry the game's reception, look to the recommended reviews for evidence of this. If the enemy design had more variety than ranged dude, fast dude, fat dude and elite dude with more than two models for each and attempted to hide their blatant copy and pasting with some different models and mechanics thrown in this game could've been so much better. Anything to make me do something other than spam light/heavy attack in every fight.      The anime tiddies are tremendous though.     If I could have refunded this game I would have, but I couldn't so here I am writing this review instead. The most I will do now is hop online to kill a boss with a rando every now and then, though it will most likely be uninstalled. If you have lots of friends that are playing this then you can get some more mileage out of this title, I don't know how/if scaling is implemented.     TL;DR: pick it up on sale, the combat and bosses become stale and lose their appeal after the first two hours and the story is laughable. It does enough to keep you entertained for a weekend. If you are a really big fan of anime and the soulsborne hack-and-slash genre then you might be able to justify buying it at full price. If it was £10 less I would recommend			"
Recommended,11.9,"																Hello~ she doesn't usually write reviews, but hey, why not have this be her first one on steam?Code Vein is a game that looked interesting to her the first time she saw it, and she can say that it has lived up to her expectations. It's essentially what everyone else calls it, a souls-like game with anime themes. So if you like both those things, or just one even, you can probably get a lot of joy from the game.It has a ton of customization options for appearance, allowing you to detail dual tones in hair and eyes, even the highlight design in the eyes, hair extensions which you can individually color in the accessory portion... Just, like, a bunch of stuff you can customize. So, that's a big plus for herself since she loves making fun looks for her characters that fit her various tastes in aesthetics.For gameplay, the fundamentals are very souls-like. She would say it feels slightly more forgiving in terms of things like iframes, general range and clunkiness, but that it does carry over the big jumps in mobility and dodging from different weight ratios. Being quick as opposed to normal or slow is very useful, especially after you have a solid footing for the game's combat system.Parrying is in the game, and it's about as hard as you'd expect. It's about as beneficial as getting backstabs (which yes, are also in the game). Speaking of backstabs, they aren't that hard to do. She would say the backstab system feels very similar to Dark Souls 1. You sort of just go into your animation when you successfully attack behind an enemy at the right angle. Just be careful of the enemy turning quickly to do an action since that typically is what will cause your attempt to just be a regular attack instead.Speaking of those benefits for parrying and backstabs, you get a big hit, as you might imagine, as well as increase your max ichor (magic/ability resource) until you sit at a Mistile (bonfire equivalent from souls games). It also restores some ichor in doing so. So, pretty useful. Normal hits can also restore depleted ichor. How much they restore depends on a weapons's drainage rating.For normal attacks, you've got your quick attacks, your strong attack (typically chargeable on all weapons), your roll attacks, your running attacks, your run input + quick attack and one for strong attack too. You can do a straight up drain attack (which has similar properties to your backstabs and parry attacks), but doing so in such a way does require you to charge it up first (time to charge and properties depends on your blood veil which is sort of your only armor as well as a weapon for drain-based attacks). You can do a comboed drain attack by starting a normal attack first and then pressing your running input + drain attack button (no charge necessary, but tends to do reduced damage, like 30%~35% less, but might vary).That should be all the normal attacks that don't require ichor. For weapons, so far she's found various swords, light, medium, and heavy. Giant hammers, spears, bayonets (long sword spear hybrids essentially that have special shooting abilities for their strong attack, both normal and charged, which consumes ichor). There might be others she just hasn't stumbled upon yet though. Very important to note is that weapons tend to have unique attacks for most of their moves. Sometimes you'll see some that are similar to one another, but generally they seem pretty unique and varied. So, it's worth playing with each weapon you find to see if it has some sort of basic moveset that you like. Blood Veils, as mentioned, are weapons as well, but for your drain-based attacks. They have types, and those types are unique from one another. So, it's good to experiment with them since their properties are pretty different from one another. They also govern your defense and resistances greatly, so just something else to consider too there.Her own build is focused on bayonets right now (builds are mostly based on gear/gift/bloodpact setups which she'll mention all that soon), and she found it beneficial to have two different types of one in her two main weapon slots (yes, you have the traditional double weapon slot setup in code vein). They each have a different unique moveset as well as unique strong/charged strong attacks, so it's a pretty handy feature for variety, even with specialized builds like hers is currently.Speaking of bloodpacts and gifts... Bloodpacts greatly affect your main parameters such as stat scaling, hp, stamina (action meter), base ichor count, etc. All that stuff. Gifts are a mix of passive and active abilities you can learn from that bloodpact. You can also master gifts (besides a few exceptions, but exceptions are rare) which let you use them with other bloodpacts. You can have a max of 4 passives and 8 actives equipped at one time. She isn't sure if you can raise this later, but so far that seems to be the max for her. All actives cost Ichor. They are pretty strong too no matter how you want to focus your setup. So learning to manage your ichor resource is going to be very helpful. It isn't a system locked to casters like in most other souls-like games. It is pretty easy to maintain though after you get a feel for it, so don't worry about it being a chore (minus maybe the initial part of the game where you're just learning everything, but that's to be expected).You will generally just use whatever bloodpact you use that best augments the stats that power your desired setup the best (you can switch them on the fly, it will remember your passive/active gifts you last had equipped with each particular bloodpact). Gifts range from giving you temporarily stat boosts, to better evasive abilities, enhanced normal attacks, melee skills, ranged skills, magic-like abilities (both for close and far, generally with elements attached). All sorts of defensive abilities. Better stamina management stuff, ways to heal your partner... Passives in particular tend to just raise various stats while equipped, be it hp, stamina, balance (poise essentially which governs hit stun defense). Some give special abilities and enhancements when you fill your focus bar.Your focus bar is a bar which fills when you block or dodge enemy attacks. When filled, you will launch whatever you're fighting, making it vulnerable to offensive spam. Various gifts will give you enhancements when you accomplish this, or make it easier to fill. Be careful though, enemies have focus bars too, and will often do special abilities when they glow blue and have a sphere symbol go off. Gear (all weapons and blood veils) can be fortified too. Pretty significant boosts are given to both, so it's pretty useful to fortify your favorite gear you like to use. It's not really that hard to get what you need to do so, at least it hasn't been in the start, so don't be too scared to upgrade the things you like. You can transform all gear too, which gives it special properties. It generally sacrifices one aspect about the gear to either enhance or grant another aspect. E.g. Less base attack for enhanced drain rating for a specialization to replenish your ichor count. Or enhances attack at the expense of greater weight, or the opposite, less attack for lower weight.There's a lot more she'd like to share but she has limited character space. Needless to say, there's a lot to the core gameplay. She's found it all very enjoyable and satisfying to learn and continually master. It's very easy to have a variety of builds to swap to as well. There is a partner system in the game as well, and partners are very useful in this game, enriching the experience. You can even build your relationship with your partners (and even store npcs) and learn their lore as you help them, and in turn, receive a lot of strong benefits too. So, a big plus there.Nearly out of character space, so just to conclude, giving two thumbs up for Code Vein since it's everything she was expecting and there is plenty to do in it. ♡			"

Recommended,94.2,"																A solid souls-like.-Overview-Playing Code Vein will likely feel familiar to those who have played Dark Souls 3; some of the animations and gameplay elements even look like they were plucked right out of that game.It keeps the checkpoint, currency, healing and co-op systems, as well as the gear upgrade system and the basic combat mechanics like parrying, rolling, weight and repeatedly getting your face smashed-in by really angry undead. 🎮Code Vein can be played with keyboard/mouse, though I recommend using a controller.🎮-Gameplay-Combat:Combat keeps the basic dark souls recipe, but tuned a little more toward hack-and-slash and with prominent ability use. The ichor (mana) system works well; you get ichor from damaging enemies and doing special attacks on them like backstabs or parry attacks and the abilities (of which there are many to choose from) are fun to use.A large variety of offensive & defensive abilities become available throughout the game, which you can mix & match freely to suit your playstyle.Weapons come in five classes each with fairly distinct differences and associated abilities, but variety within each class is pretty small. There's a big difference between a one handed-sword and a two-handed sword, but each one-handed sword will be pretty similar.Enemies & Bosses:Enemy variety is decent with some enemies re-used, but still enough new ones throughout the game to mix things up as you progress. Personally, I enjoy fighting almost all of the mobs in this game, though a small few can get a little frustrating on new game+, usually because of some cheap-feeling mechanic, though such occurrences are rare enough not to be a real issue.Bosses are a major part of Code Vein, and in my opinion are not quite up to traditional Dark Souls quality. They keep the same basic boss recipes but the balancing often feels a little off, especially on new game+ where damn-near any significant hit from a boss will one-hit-kill you.Often a boss's moves can feel cheap and just far too spammy. For example, sometimes you will dodge a boss's attack and attempt to perform an action; using an ability or healing for instance. In the time it takes you to perform the (often uninterruptible) animation, the boss can finish its attack, turn around, telegraph its next attack, launch it and crush your skull. This can be due to poor timing on the player's part, but many of the bosses just love their super-fast, short-telegraph attacks and use them constantly. This speed can also lead to the player spending more time chasing them around the arena than actually fighting them, which gets tiring.Boss fights are still enjoyable despite the above, but I feel there was some missed potential. Level Design:Level design in Code Vein has nice variety with most areas being distinct from their neighbours. One particular level feels like it was created by a criminally insane 3D-printer, but for the most part the areas are sensibly laid out and relatively easy to navigate while still requiring exploration."

Recommended,58.6,"-Interaction-Customisation:The character creator is strong, though it could use some more variety in basic things like face shape and clothing. It makes up for it though with excellent customisation of accessories and markings (tattoos etc). You can stick glowing neon top hats on your knees if you want to. Story:Code Vein replaces traditional cutscenes or text walls for non-essential lore with small, linear levels called vestiges for the player to walk through as the story plays out via audio cues and static displays. It's far more atmospheric than simple text, though can feel a little long-winded as you cannot skip individual lines of dialogue. Main story and characters are sometimes a little plain but generally likeable and perhaps a bit deeper than one might expect. It's no Mass Effect, but not bad by any means. It's an anime game with anime characters, more lighthearted than Dark Souls, but still has its dark moments. Code Vein also indirectly ties into the God Eater series, so may be of extra interest to fans looking for more lore from that world.-Technical-A.I:Friendly AI is surprisingly good in Code Vein. You can bring one AI companion with you at a time and they are competent. They can kill enemies by themselves, revive you from death, and take a boss's full attention while you take a breather.Enemy mob AI isn't revolutionary but neither is it noticeably dumb. It's adequate for its purpose and makes for a fun combat experience.Multiplayer:Co-op consists of basically the same system as Dark Souls; the host summons another player into their world, who can kill enemies, collect loot and fight the boss. The limitations are the same as well; you cannot summon players into a zone you've already completed or they cannot access, summoned players will not progress their story and they will be automatically booted after the area boss is defeated.In my experience the co-op system has been fairly reliable. I've experienced occasional hiccups in the networking performance but for the most part it's been fine.Audio/Visuals:This game was played with the following PC specs:Intel i5-4440 3.10 GHz16Gb DDR3 RAMGeforce GTX 750 ti SC 2GbHDD Visually the game looks very nice and I was impressed with its optimisation. When I played through the game I was using a graphics card on par with or slightly below the listed minimum requirement, but I was still able to get a stable 60fps with the game looking pretty nice. The soundtrack is decent, though nothing really stood out to me save for one particular area that has a very nice track which I won't spoil in this review as the package of visuals, story and plot at that particular moment are what make it special."

Unnecessary loading in and out when skipping vestiges, for example. Minor annoyances like this do not detract significantly from the overall game experience, but can be a little frustrating at times. -Conclusion-Overall I think this is an excellent game, fun solo and with a friend. Bosses feel like they're balanced a bit weirdly, especially on new game+, but for the most part are still enjoyable. The aesthetic variety in the levels is nice, and the gameplay feels very rewarding once you're familiar.I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Dark Souls and/or a rewarding but challenging game experience.If you're looking for more quality reviews like this, follow our curator page, Devils in the Detail.

Not Recommended,29.5,"																For me who just started playing these types of games, I would definitely recommend picking up this game. I don't know if there's any other games that'll be easier to get into if you want to start but this game is worth it to try out.			"
Recommended,30.3,"																I held off on writing a review for this game for a while, mainly because I feel like I'm only getting the base amount of the game, but the reality is that I was so deeply embedded in the shameless masturbation that is making a JoJo protagonist to star in every cutscene. I seriously spent two of the first hours of playtime trying to figure out if I wanted to be a rappist or a dishwasher because I was having such a hard time deciding between JoJo and Hatsune MeToo.Shortly after learning that the game censors my ancestral Chinese name, Wang, I quickly adopted the German Equivalent, Schwanz, and went off! Onward I went, killing friends and foe alike! The first person you kill isn't your friend, and in fact you're just littering on mother nature so it can ♥♥♥ blood. I really wish I was joking about that last one.You immediately are thrown into the depths of anime weeb fantasy as the next ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene has some Kingdom Hearts ♥♥♥♥ with you resting your head in your bid-tiddy gf's lap. Some punk makes the mistake of asking a woman dressed in bandages a question, and next thing you know I’m a slave! After doing the hokey pokey and exchanging allies who I honestly couldn’t tell apart until one turned into Jabba the Hut.After murdering the only friend I had I made a new friend and followed him back home. While there wasn’t any free candy, this is where the anime ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slams it’s ♥♥♥♥ on the table. From here on the whole game turns into believing in each other and having hope that you’ll find answers, so long as you believe in yourself, your friends, and brush your teeth.After a while you and your merry gang of whoever the one person is that you want to see the most decide that it's time to start killing again: Enter Anime Apocalypse stage right. The world is pretty...uninspired. Aside from the gigantic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spikes laying around for no reason, you're going to be looking at a lot of staple crops. The ruined city, the Farron Great Swamp, Cathederal of the Deep and Anor Londo's illegitimate child--you know how this goes. EVERYTHING IS BLACK RED AND DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRTY! NEX GEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!The Black Parade and you are trying to figure out what a Duke Nukem is and why ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ still want to eat it. You find people's memories, which if you don't peer into sad bad things happen--which in my opinion was the opposite lesson I learned from the Anne Frank Diary. You and the Funky Bunch go from level to level shoving Fireball candies into your hand faster than my ass cheeks could have carried me on any Halloween night. People seem to appreciate this magical talent you have, but not enough to suck your ♥♥♥♥, so they give you the option to skip them in case you decide that backstories are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who pour their cereal into bowls of milk.The first milf in the game isn't even that hot. I'm very disappointed in you, anime.Chick with Russian hat has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ German name, excuse me? English audio is terrible, I'm suffering through it because the voice actors clearly said ""Woah, hey. This ♥♥♥♥? Yeah, that's too drammatic, I'm just going to have this guy express his emotions of pure despair by keeping a flat monotone voice despite arms flailing and fist-slamming happening on-screen by my character."" This actually happens like an hour into the game, switch to Jalapeno for voice acting done by people who want to keep their jobs.Story is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tame; You'll find the story somewhat predictable, however I love that the main villains are Immortan Joe, Castlevania's Dracula, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego's Clothes, Twinsies, Wolf Mother, Strippers That Give Me Confusing Boners, and the Blowfish from Hootie and the Blowfish.While the story is pretty meh, it's still fun. The character growth and script is awful, but again that's in English so I'm going to let it slide for now. This game is still overwhelmingly fun because it's Anime Dark Souls on Training wheels, literally. I got my friend into this game because he wanted to try Dark Souls but it's too hard. If that last sentence sounds like someone you know, or you, then this game is for you/them. With the power of memories, blue gatorade, Ground Lightning, and friendship you and the rest of the cast from Code: Geass will embark on a journey to save the world from itself. Every cutscene I sit on the edge of my seat slamming f12 because this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pretty and has so many moments for me to shamelessly mastu--enjoy my character on screen, fully animated, and without a voice...again. The gameplay and the combat is, again, Anime Dark Souls on Training Wheels. Core leveling system revolves around an exchange system that only cares about one thing: you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ want to stop being weak? If so, crank that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to 99. After you level up, you get skills from leveling codes, which are like covenants/classes that accessorize your stats depending on what build you want. If you like a code but hate the active stats despite its baller passives you are able to not even use that class and just max-level it so you can copy-paste your perfect moveset to the code you actually like. You have the ability to store two weapons, which can be really helpful and create a unique moveset...or you can be like me and keep a rifle in your spare for that odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you want to kite.The game wants you to think it's fashion souls, and I can't wait to get there since it seems like the jackets make a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difference between whether or not my children will see me again.Interesting and fun gameplay, decent story, easy and fun co-op with no PVP invasions (♥♥♥♥ you Dark Souls 2 fans), and challenging bosses that offer a real feeling of reward on playthrough one. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Anime and games designed to churn boys into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Would really like backstabbing and dodge rolling to be tweaked a bit more so I stop getting hit when I clearly shouldn't have been, and so that I don't sit there doing the Harlem Shake every time the game decides it doesn't want me to fist Eugenia again. I'm really excited to keep playing this game across multiple playthroughs/NG+, with my friends, as well as journey on my own.4/5 I really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enjoy Anime Dark Souls feat. Big Tiddy GF.			"
Recommended,81.9,"																Really enjoyed this one. It has some flaws, but also includes good additions to the souls like formula. I can recommend this to Souls fans who are not annoyed by anime.The story is somewhat cliché and from time to time VERY anime, but I liked the direct narrating approach compared to Dark Souls where I struggled in the past with keeping my motivation up to continue playing the game.Gameplay is fine overall, very souls like. A bit more ""punch"" in the hits would be better though, because here it feels like you are striking through air. The fact that you can switch your class and skills on the go is very cool. The pool of available classes and skills in the end is more than enough.Speaking of very cool: the character editor is outstanding. It has so many customization options, wow. Should be a standard for similar games.I hope Code Vein gets an improved sequel, I count myself as a fan now :)			"

Gameplay is fine although certainly not the best in the genre, but the soundtrack is fairly decent at least.

It is also great how you can change class in a heartbeat from the menu, even if that takes away alot of the rpg elements it could have had.Overall its a good game which I do recommend to at least try out			"
Recommended,45.2,"																Sadly, just a clunky dark souls simulator sporting a anime filter. Every level is just a miasma of corridors. Nothing feels immersive. Feels like something ChatGPT would spit out if you used ""dark souls"", ""vampires"", ""anime"", ""dystopia"", and  ""chutes & ladders"" as keywords. The character creator is the only refined feature in this mess.I spent around $10 for the deluxe edition, and I don't feel it was worth it.			"
Recommended,21.7,"																Code Vein is a game that promised to deliver a Souls-like experience, but unfortunately fails to live up to that expectation. The quest design in the game is disappointing, lacking the depth and creativity that players expect from a Souls-style game. The developers seem to have misinterpreted what makes the Souls franchise so successful, and as a result, the game feels like a shallow imitation of the original.Despite these shortcomings, the game does have some redeeming features. The character design details in Code Vein are truly exceptional, and the level of detail in each character is impressive. The intricate designs and attention to detail are some of the best aspects of the game and help to make the characters feel unique and memorable.The graphics in Code Vein are average at best, and the music is also unimpressive. While the graphics are not bad, they are not particularly impressive either, and the same can be said for the soundtrack. The audio design fails to captivate the player and adds little to the overall experience of the game.In conclusion, Code Vein is a game that is let down by its quest design and the misinterpretation of the Souls-like concept by the developers. While the character design details are excellent, the average graphics and unimpressive music make the game feel unfulfilling. If you're looking for a challenging and engaging Souls-style game, there are many other options available that offer better gameplay and a more satisfying experience.However, I recommend it as its brings fresh air to anime-styled games by adding a Souls-like flavor.			"
Recommended,50.2,"																Well, I must admit, I really enjoy this game alot. First of all, the top-notch voice acting, particularly from the Japanese voice actors and actresses. It truly enhances the immersive my experience and I feel that every character has their own individual. As always.The story follows a typical anime-style narrative, where someone aims to become a hero with their 'nakama'. As always, some of female characters are on dual mission: fighting monsters and pushing dress code boundaries!  Well, keep it aside from now. There are bits of the storytelling that aren't explained well and might come across as odd (or maybe I miss it), but overall, I still keep invested on the game. While the pace of the story feels just about right, the 'good' ending doesn't quite satiate my thirst for well-rounded conclusion (yes, it has multiple endings). I wonder, though, if it's just me or if others also share this sentiment. Despite this, from a writing perspective, each ending is really well written. The art and animation are a feast for the eyes, precisely what you'd expect from ufotable. The gameplay is somewhat akin to less intense, anime-style Dark Souls; it's manageable as long as you don't blame your finger for any misclick though. Still, this game beats dark soul on the FEELS department. Let's talk about the best part. The soundtracks are truly well done, especially ""Memory of the Lost"". This haunting melody that resonates while traversing the memories in the vestige sends shivers down my spine every single time! And the way the game melds each vestige memory with this captivating soundtrack leaves me utterly speechless. A total masterpiece!However, when it comes to the map levels, it's a bit unbalance from my perspective. Some maps have intuitive layout, but others are overly-excessively complicated. The Cathedral of Sacred Blood map takes the crown for complexity.  I mean, I wonder the developer had discussion about how to torture the players without player realizing about it. :') You can search for it if you want with this keyword 'Cathedral Code Vein meme'.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind inviting the onion ninjas over from time to time while slashing monster.			"
Recommended,162.5,"																This game is overall great! More pros than cons for sure.The story is kinda a basic save the world because you're special set in a wasteland after a great disaster strikes. Its not bad by any means though! The game has a pretty good character creator, although one thing I will say is that it feels like the character creator is definitely more catered towards making a female character rather than a male one. There are way more customization options for female character models than the male ones, great for the female characters! But if you decide to make a male character, expect to have a lot less options for your character, mainly hair and accessories. The combat feels really nice, engagements feel like you're in a high risk fight, making you choose your movements wisely, or be punished for not moving well enough/parrying/blocking/attacking when you have the opportunity. When you take on a boss, or move well in combat and take out a lot of enemies in a cool way, it feels extremely gratifying. There's a really cool class system, and some of the fighting animations look super cool, and make you feel awesome when you pull off some of the finishers. It definitely lives up to its name as a souls-like game, some areas REALLY can get you on the ropes against some of the things you encounter. The music is pretty damn good. Going into boss fights, and enemy rich areas, the music that plays sets the mood with a really nice stoic soundtrack. The graphics are really well done, SOME textures could be better, but overall graphics are great. The game is optimized pretty well, on my PC, currently running a 1080 with an i5-8400, I'm getting well over 95 frames, even during boss fights or engagements. However one thing that is REALLY annoying is that for some reason, FOR SOME REASON motion blur, and film grain start already activated on the game, so just disable it in the options, really simple fix, but neither of those options should be default activated, it looks really bad, makes it harder to move, and kills your frames. Another thing is that the keyboard controls are absolutely terrible, which is why this is a game I play with a controller. Most people play with controllers for souls-like games I've heard, but this one just has absolutely horrible default keyboard and mouse controls, and I couldn't find very many comfortable alternatives to playing with K+M.The voice acting is also very good! Both the English and Japanese versions are excellent! I haven't completed the game yet, but from my experience so far I'm absolutely loving this!Score: 9/10, a great game for getting into souls-like games, or if you're looking for a challenge, and wanting to work to progress.

"
Not Recommended,53.8,"																Honestly, there's a lot to like about Code Vein so I'll begin with the first things that stood out to me.Music:The moment I launched the game that title screen music really got me. Music plays a very important role in a game so I was 100% hyped when the title screen had music as enjoyable as it was and yes the music only gets better and better. However, I fully realize that just because I enjoyed the music that doesn't mean you will but in my option it's very well suited for the game.Graphics: Now let me just say the compared to other Bandai anime games this is an improvement by all means. However, as a word of advice, I wouldn't turn the draw distance to highest do to the hit to fps being a sizeable margin and I have a GTX 1660ti Overclocked. That's really the only setting that affects fps to a sizeable degree. Other than that the graphics are impressive. I'll make a steam guide for graphics soon so if you want an in-depth review on the graphic settings keep an out for that.Story:First I'd like to congratulate Bandai on making a story that I deem the best in all the games I've played to date. Now with that said I'll say this about the story. The story goes in-depth about the lore of the world and does very well with it's pacing so not to throw it all at you in bursts or at once which I very much liked. The story is this game's strongest suit but it does have its downsides which I'll get into in a bit.Issues:Okay while the statements above may seem like I'm just a fanboy that's not even close to true so allow me to explain. One of the first issues I ran into was that the draw distance at the high setting vs the highest setting is insane. To the point where it made me lose 20 fps, which if you compare that to other games some are like that but a lot only drop by a range of 10-15 fps. The next issue I encountered was that if you did all the depths in your first play through the bosses get too easy. Those were the only issues I had though in all honesty.Gameplay/Controls:I'm happy to report that the gameplay was good and I had zero issues with it. The leveling system was well done but as I stated above the bosses are too easy if you do all the depths on your first playthrough. The Controls were well done which is great since controls can easily make or break a game.Would I Recommend this game:Yes, I would if you don't mind the issues I talked about and you realize that this game is a souls-like and is not easy.			"
Recommended,233.7,"																One of the best challenge of the ""Souls-like"" Game when played solo without any companion. With a companion however, this game is just a joke as most of the enemies will just chase your partner and you will just slap their ""behind"" with your companion still dish out more damage than you..But Still, one the best games ever released, story is nice and Ng+ is ridiculous.			"
Recommended,87.1,"																Anime Dark Souls is a fitting description, even if its not quite 100% dark souls.If you like anime, and dark souls, you might enjoy this game. Its got varying levels of difficulty depending on the options within the game to use. The character customization is top class and the art style is super appealing.AI companions are very competent, sometimes seemingly too competent in the early game, but quickly show themselves off to be invaluble sources of revival during tough boss fights. The only complaint against the companions is they suffer the dragons dogma prawn chatterbox sickness, and comment about everything all the time. Which is charming at first but can quickly become grating if your not used to tuning out captain obvious remarks about how you can climb that ladder xDThe most difficult part to adjust to for souls fans is the twist on healing this game throws down on you. If your used to Estus flasks and how they heal a massive amount of HP the regen system here will be a struggle to cope with at first, as the self healing is abysmal without passive skills or active skills to enhance it, including the estus style upgrades of effectiveness and number of uses.The co-op is very functional and can be used for exploring maps or just fighting bosses in the open fields or the depths. Sadly depending on where you are for calling a distress signal will cut the available pool of co-op partners in half, since you can only call out for help in either the depths for others in the depths or out in the main game itself.All in all I personally find this game to have a lot of promise and extremely fun.			"
Recommended,4.1,"																Anime Dark Souls, what more can I say?			"
Recommended,2,"																It has been long since I fell in love with a game like this			"
Recommended,138.5,"																Anime Souls is here. Calling it Anime Souls is accurate, but don't expect it to be on the same level as Dark Souls in every area. Souls implies not just challenging combat, but also character stat balancing, intricate map design, subtle yet deep lore/storytelling, and complex characters with different motivations. You'll pretty much get only the first two in this one.The basics are there: Rest, level up, and refill heals at bonfires. Died? Go get your souls back from the place you died at. Summon help? You can do that. Walls of mist to walk through? Check. The Good: Combat: Once you get used to how CV handles combat you'll see that it's simple but deep enough to be fun. Enemies generally don't get staggered by your first normal hit unless you're using the heaviest weapon types, so you need to be careful. There are of course small, fast enemies and big, powerful enemies that require different tactics. Backstabbing and parrying is a thing, but I found parries to be practically useless in this game and not worth the risk. Pretty much any hit can take off half your HP, almost every enemy has at least 1 attack you can't parry, and ""estus"" healing (the ones you get back at a ""bonfire"") is extremely limited. Your parry window is also defined by which armor you're wearing, which... Yeah, it's a bit bonkers.The reason you want to backstab is because it's one of three ways to ""drain"" enemies - which refills your mana. You need that use special attacks and magic. The other two ways are aformentioned parries and combo drains: which is just adding a drain attack to a regular attack combo.Combat is improved by the next point:Character Customization: You unlock new classes as you play the game and find ""Vestiges"" hidden across the game world, you'll unlock more and more skills and classes to use. You can be a swordsman, a berserker, a mage, a gunner, and so on so forth.The variety is staggering, and what makes it even better is that if you use a particular skill enough and max out its proficiency, you can keep using that skill outside its class. Want to be a 2H Greatsword berserker with some magic? It'll take a bit of effort, but you can do that!You can equip up to 4 passive abilties and 8 active abilities.It's an anime-looking game, so it has to have a big character creator. One of the best I've seen in a while in fact. It's massive, and it doesn't lock any cosmetics away behind DLC or even unlocks. Want a fancy hat? Or an oversized backpack? It's all there.... Yes... There is a sort of boob slider too... Now stop asking.Companions: Holy moly a game in 2019 that has NPC allies that are COMPETENT? You can choose (it's optional but highly recommended) to take an NPC ally with you, each has their own combat style and a unique co-op only skill with varied effects.They're not flawless, but through about half the game they can solo most of the mobs if you feel particularly lazy. They can also revive you if they have health to spare.Enemies tend to focus on the player far more than the NPC, so they can take huge chunks of HP out of bosses too.There's just one little problem: They. Will. Not. Shut. The. ♥♥♥♥. Up. You can't go two seconds of gameplay without them commenting on something. It's MADDENING... but that's the price you pay.The Meh:Map Variety: Except for one particular map, it's okay. There are a LOT of corridors. It starts off as a post-apocalyptic cityscape before moving on to a mountainous region, a sewer/flooded section, a GIGANTIC yet disgustingly bad Dark-Souls-referencing Anor Londo-lookalike that can ♥♥♥♥ right off to the moon, a modern military base, and even a snowy area. Aesthetically pleasing but mostly just corridors stacked with enemies.If I didn't know better, and someone told me the maps were randomly generated, I'd take their word for it.Equipment: 1H swords, 2H swords, halberds, hammers, and guns. Those are your lot. Within them there are a lot of copy & paste movesets. Weapons do not have a special attack like in DS, that's all handled by the game's class + skill system (""This skill can only be used with a sword""). Some look pretty cool, but it's not a huge selection of unique weapons.Armor is a bit more meaningful, because it determines your parry animation and resistances, but again not a huge selection.The Bad:Story: Oh my tits it's bad. So bad I found myself skipping cutscenes on my first playthrough. It's not that the voice acting is bad, it's just that the cutscenes and characters are COMPLETELY uninteresting. The writing is all over the place, and I can't find any way to even say something slightly positive about it. It's full of cliches and predictable outcomes.I.. *Hngh* Okay... It has multiple endings... There, I tried.Recommended all in all because of overal fun factor. Wouldn't say it's worth full price though unless you REALLY love souls games.			"

Not Recommended,56.8,"																Just a few hours into the game and i'm in love with Code Vein. To put out some quick points:+ Amazing combat and gameplay: The basic classes (called Blood Codes) will feel boring and clunky if you leave them be and play as is - You need to max proficiency with the Gifts, then mix and match them to your playstyle on the class you want; that way you can get epic fights and fluid combat.+ Epic Soundtrack: The musical composition goes very well with the story, it brings a tear to my eye.+ Git Gud: Dark Souls style of kill enemies for Haze (currency) that you use to buy gear and level up. You die, you lose it all and you'll need to go back to where you died to retrieve it.+ Customisation: The many options allow you to make that dream husbando/waifu you've always wanted.+ SJW/Game-Urinalist Seal of approval: They hate it, you'll love it.+ Animu: Yes= Map design: The only thing that borderline bothers me - it's a beautiful world but it does get a bit confusing if you get lost and it's a bit difficult to know where to go if you're directionally challenged like me.Edit: I feel like i've been hit by the feels-truck and then it backed up over me and ran me over again.Edit Edit: Io is our goddess			"
Not Recommended,0.2,"																Thumbs up to the story, thumbs down to the gimmick and childish characters. Also, what's the problem with these character designers that feel the need to expose every bit of skin on the female characters for apparent no reason at all? A bit of exposure here and there I don't mind, but this game takes this to another level entirely. Keep asking myself who goes into battle wearing a micro dress that shows your panties to everyone. Go figure. The combat and character customization are good in the game. Exploration is a bit tedious and redundant, which made me drop the game several times until I felt like playing again until I finally finished it. Anyway I would give the game a 5/10.			"
Recommended,44.3,"																Good game to be recommended to anyone who enjoys souls-like system and experience. Soundtrack is beautiful and well fitted for the world around us. The idea of dynamic ability switching is good too, though have to admit that it bears the same problem as, say, spells in The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind - there are lots of interesting once but only few of them are truly useful. As of main story - I couldn't say it's something fresh or revolutionary, but with all pros and cons it is catching and worth exploring. The only thing that definitely made me sad a bit is bosses - they lack Dark Souls originality and interesting mechanics being pretty much the same.As a conclusion it is the game that totally worth investing time and efforts. Won't say anything about DLCs though - haven't played any yet.			"
Recommended,9.2,"																Before you dive deep, let's make this straight:This is NOT Dark SoulsAnd don't expect it to be.However also contrary to popular opinion it's not just Anime souls like with tits, the game brings a fair amount of its own custom mechanics or variations of them combined with a LOT of content to consume. In TL;DR form, if you like soulslikes genre but don't require 1:1 emulation of the formula and are fine with more forgiving gameplay loop, anime aesthetics, fanservice and writing tropes then Code Vein should be good for you, in any other case - not so much.The technicalsGame runs on Unreal Engine 4 and makes a decent use out of it, supports up to 240 FPS out of the box (unlike majority of games in this segment), graphics are acceptable although some textures are pretty low res which scales awfully with bug which causes always lowest LOD to load until you get very close to the object.Performance is pretty okay, it could be a bit better or even across the board but it's nothing alarming, maxed out on my rig (4770k,rtx 2070, 16gb ram) i'm well over 100 FPS for majority of the time.Stability also doesn't seem to be problematic, in over 40 hours i encountered only one engine crash.Other than that, there ARE bugs, however most of the important ones have been fixed so far. There are still few left, including annoying ones but i expect this to be sorted out in coming weeks or months.The storyIt's there, in the genre i would put it closer to Nioh than core Souls series. There's no ""muh deep lore"" and everything is shown and explained directly in game.Other than that, it's pretty standard stuff that you could see in a seasonal Anime and forget about it by the time season ends.Game pushes ""everyone is a good guy in disguise"" and ""everyone has a dark and troubled past"" tropes to their limits, up to a point where it tries to set up your companions as tragic characters before you're invested into them enough to care.It's not awful but don't expect anything exceptional in this aspect, it serves its purpose to drive the events and characters and that's about it.GameplayFirst off - this game is MUCH more forgiving than either Dark Souls, Sekiro or Nioh. By default you're given access to multiple NPC companions which will aid you in combat and literally bail you out of death situations multiple times. On top of that you can get another player to aid you in areas where you haven't defeated the main boss, who ALSO can prevent you from dying.On top of that, it's very easy to overlevel yourself making any bossfights much easier than they normally would be.Of course both of above are optional - you're not required to make use of companion NPC and as usual you level at your leisure so difficulty of the game is in your hands.Besides that, the core experience is close to core ""soulslike"" with added twist of probably more than a hundred active/passive abilities tied to meta-classes called blood codes. Most of the abilities can be upgraded to be untied from specific class they belong to, enabling players to make very customized builds.With that said, player progression and builds mostly come from this system rather than leveling up individual stats as their increase is only influenced by overall level and current ""class"" with possibility to use specific passive abilities to raise given stat(s).The customizationThis by itself is worth a point of note of its own.It's probably one of most expansive systems in the game, where unlike in most other games in this genre, it's possible to make an actually aesthetically pleasing character rather than blue guy, pale guy or shrek. It's too deep to explain so i recommend looking up how it looks on YouTube and seeing for yourself.ContentBase game offers more content than i actually expected, 100% initial first run took me around 40 hours.There's a healthy amount of locations and nearly all of them come with their own ""dungeon"" version although there's no hiding that vast majority of locations are comprised of narrow spaces, corridors or confusing mazes (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Londo specifically).There's also a fair amount of weapons although the actual variety of weapon types is a bit lacking in the base game, perhaps it is something that will eventually be improved with additional DLCs.Variety of enemies is also somewhat questionable, where you'll quickly find main archetypes and see their repeats or reskins further down the line.OverallCode Vein is certainly more than i expected it to be, as someone who likes Soulslikes but isn't 100% hardcore purist, i greatly enjoyed Code Vein so far and can't wait to see what will future content bring.

Recommended,30.9,"																I cannot recommend this game at full price, IMHO i'd wait for at least 25% off sale. I have played the betas, demos and online-stress test on the PS4, so I rushed my way and skipped the cut-scenes as I've seen them twice before. I had some hope that game would improve after the beta, which was clearly not the case. It is a mediocre game, giving it a thumbs down doesn't mean its outright bad. I'd rate it 6/10Currently, the multiplayer is bugged, it depends on your steam download region, it's a hassle but not game breaking, and not the main issue, and workable around anyway.Edit: 2 people added me to ask about the workaround. Just change your Steam Download region ( Steam > Settings > Downloads)  to the same region as your friend. Also, Make sure that your region in-game matches your friend's region (or set your matchmaking to all regions). and this one is a no brainer: Set up a password.Let's talk about the game itself. Sure, the game is edgy, most characters could probably cut you with their words. Even so, their designs fit the world and the setting of the game. P.S its an anime game. so expect everything to be cheesy either way.  so for the characters and world, I'd say its doing good. Its nothing unique or mind-blowing. but its good enough.The combat is the main issue here, it feels severely lacking. The hit feedback on opponents sucks. The enemies get staggered with every couple of hits. There is no weapon weight factor other than the in-game system that affects your dash/roll. Edit: You do unlock weapons with different animations mid-way, and near the end.  so really there are just 5 weapons in the game that were re-skinned with other names/stats, maybe slightly different animations  (Probably due to the Core Cast system) . Bandai-Namco thinks that adding screen-shake whenever your weapon hits means you're getting hit feedback.Ranged weapon fire looks flying red pixel lasers from 2005, the only thing somewhat better is the caster codes. I mean come on, even indie game developers made smoother combat than this? is this the standard for triple A titles nowadays?Next, the enemy AI... Most of the enemies tend to battle-cry when they see you for 3 blue moons. you could back-stab them a 100 times and they'd still be shouting. They don't even turn around to follow you while they shout. they just stand there begging to be killed. They also like spamming attacks even when you're not in-range. Giant monsters have blind-spots that you could just stand still and they'd not give you as much as a scratch, even when they revert to the ""OH YOU'RE BELOW ME SO I'M GONNA TRY STOMPING"" attacks, they keep turning around while trying to do it and eventually hit nothing anyway.Only the bosses have a somewhat better AI. Tho the NPC partner makes  them way too easy anyway.The Character creation is great, it has lots of options. However, that is not enough reason to give the game a thumbs up like 90% of the steam reviews. People are giving this good reviews mostly because it's anime, and are extremely biased towards that. Forgive me when I say this, I know it will trigger the weebs but, this game is very over-hyped for no good reason.			"

Not Recommended,16.3,"																I played many souls-like games and this is probably the first time I leave a negative review. I was between 2 options but in the end decided go with negative because some core mechanics are really unreliable which I can not ignore. Yet, buying during a sale wouldn't be a bad optionPros:- Flexibility on character design. Player is able to change the character whenever he/she wants- Dynamically changing blood codes and not limiting player to a class. I really liked this mechanic. You can discover all blood codes and weapons, pick the one that suits you- Multiple ways to drain. i.e combo drain attacks. This actually lets user to be active and drain during midcombat. So user does not need to wait for an opportunityCons:- I did not like level design. It doesn't feel like neither linear nor open. It is more like a maze. To me, dumping a ton of enemies in a maze between 2 resting points is not a good design. Especially that ... cathedral. Just so annoying. I wanted to quit at that level- Backstab mechanic is unreliable. It feels like a random event. I am able to backstab randomly, without even trying, in the middle of the combat. When I try to backstab on purpose it fails. Character does a random attack- Parry is unreliable. This to me maybe the most important mechanic of the game and I still do not know what the parry timing is. Parrying shouldn't be that hard. I tried in training zone to parry and it was successful. I know all monsters have different timings but they still should be predictable or stable.- Enemies become too repetetive after some point			"
Recommended,58,"																I came into this game with high expectations together with a friend, 30 hours later we are still complaining about most things. The only good thing about this game is the character customization and you can't change my opinion on that. Our biggest issue was the multiplayer, you can only invite one person to an area where you haven't defeated the boss. When the revenant is helping you, you can't use Mistles to heal or save, when they die they are forced back to their world and they have to rejoin the host manually which forces them through two loading screens. After every boss your partner is forced back to their world without being able to see the cutscene and lastly you can't join your friends from your base you have to load somewhere else first.If you were planning to get this game so you can play with your friend I don't recommend it.Level design wise it's just bland and sometimes irritating. Up to the Cathedral it was serviceable but having to fall off to reach new areas becomes old pretty quick, after that the City on fire was a chore especially in multiplayer where you can use mistles and you're forced to take damage just to progress with the fire floors and lastly the sand area where for some reason the sand drains ichor and slows which just makes the game feel sluggish. The mistle placement on the sand map was also horrible, only unlocking the mistle at the boss arena after you defeat it which makes it obsolete.Enemies are in my mind split into a few stereotypes, all of them bad.I was planning on writing more of this review but I cannot for the life of me play more of this game. Personally, I don't find it fun, but the bugs were funny every now and then because I was playing with a friend.			"

Also, as the game goes on, the player can pick up random items such as weapons which are useful for the player. They have various enemies and bosses which are kinda hard to fight and thats when multiplayer mode come in which i found it useful. You can also explore the entire map to find useful things in your future adventure. I love this game alot!			"

Recommended,86.6,"																If you're not a Dark Souls fan, turn back now. Save yourself the pain and anguish.If you are a Dark Souls fan, turn back now. Save yourself the pain and anguish (of a worse Souls game).This review will be from the perspective of someone who has played all three Dark Souls games.Code Vein is basically ""Dark Souls, but worse, and with anime tiddies, and a standard Japanese JRPG plotline involving god knows what and the power of friendship"".You wake up as Anime Protagonist #564 using an excellent character creation setup. When I say Anime Protagonist #564, I mean that you have amnesia. Yes, that old trope. You're a revenant, an immortal vampire that needs to feed on blood to survive. You're woken up by Rule 34 Stockholm Syndrome Girl, who then gets kidnapped with you by other revenants to find blood beads (portable blood) for them. You escape, hilarity ensues, people die. You're taken to your new HQs where you meet your team, a spunky steampunk-like girl who loves fixing things, a reject from a Lovecraft game, a paladin who does nothing except listen to his music, and that mechanic girl from FFXV but with even less clothes. From there, Standard Japanese Anime Plot kicks in full swing and you're left wondering WTF is going on.Your ""class"" is determined by your blood code. Blood code are genes in the blood given to you by (or taken from) others, which you can further improve by collecting vestiges out in the world. Each blood code has access to unique passive and active abilities (called gifts), but you can only use those abilities on that particular blood code until you kill enough enemies with that ability equipped. Once that happens, you master the gift and can use it on another blood code. Only like two or three gifts cannot be mastered, but these are endgame things.When you level up, you don't assign points in anything. Everything scales on your level. There are stats, however, but (except for certain passive gifts that increase stats) you have zero ability to increase these. The stats are tied directly in with your blood code. A caster blood code might have higher casting stats but lower physical stats. A guardian blood code might have higher resists but lower endurance. Etc, etc.Blood veils are not only your armor, but also has a direct control over your stats as well. It should be noted that you do not parry, riposte, or backstab with your weapons. You do these with your blood veils, with different veil types having different animations. Claw-type veils have an almost instant parry animation like DS fist weapons, while spear-type veils have a longer parry delay but hit harder. It should also be noted that riposting is automatic. If you get a parry, you automatically go into a riposte. Backstabbing is a major sh*tshow in this game. You think you're directly behind the enemy, but you do a normal attack. Then you think you're off to the side, but you do a backstab. There's no rhyme or reason, and it's all down to whatever the developers thought would be considered ""back"". Parries are FAR more generous than Dark Souls, and should be utilized whenever you can.Speaking of sh*tshows, the lock-on feature is bad. Really bad. Sometimes you roll backwards when you wanted to roll forward. Sometimes the enemy moves and you're locked into a weapon animation, so you follow up with another attack but you keep attacking in the original direction instead of turning to face the enemy. It's all completely random and makes playing the game as a two-hander insufferable.AI companions are either completely OP or completely useless. If you just want some extra DPS, companions are completely fine. Whenever you get knocked down to 0 health, the companion has an ability to sacrifice some of their health to revive you. This has to be done within 2-3 seconds, or you just outright die. Doesn't seem so bad until you realize how short 2-3 seconds is. The AI will sometimes do a combo attack instead of reviving you, or get stunlocked by an enemy, or get ganged up on by multiple enemies, or just wont care and will cast the ability after five seconds while you're in the red BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL animation. Point is, don't trust your AI partner. Ever.Map design ranges from ""Meh"" to ""HOLY SH*T WHAT THE F*CK WERE YOU THINKING"". The Cathedral of Blood falls into the latter, where it's literally a multi-level maze. It helps to have a map. I suspect this is where most people will quit the game, and I don't blame them.I could go on about all the different things that I don't like in comparison to Dark Souls, but the more I write, the more I wish this WAS Dark Souls and not some cheap knockoff by the same publisher. It's no From Software game, and it absolutely shows. Even the original Dark Souls 2 was better than this piece of garbage. If you're looking for a good game with anime tiddies, just download some lewd mods for Skyrim. Hell, just download some lewd mods for Dark Souls 3.			"
Not Recommended,36.4,"																I wasn't sure if I'm going to enjoy Code Vein, but I was curious about this game, because this is a souls-like game with ""anime style""...I liked the graphics of the game, it has some really good looking environments and weapons. The character customization is surprisingly detailed, it's definitely one of the best part of the game. I enjoyed the soundtrack, there are some really banger tracks in the game. The game has a few interesting story lines for me, which you can get invested, mostly in other characters' backstory and in the bosses' stories. Most of the characters in the game are all right, they are not paper cuts, have their own motives and traits. The exchange system with different characters are interesting indeed, and you can get items from others, if you gift them things you find. The combat is weird at first, but the game has a tutorial and a manual to know more of it, and in the end I started to enjoy it. However Code Vein was a difficult game for me to get into, because the first 4-5 hours of the gameplay felt mediocre at best. Also, there are so many cutscenes, it basically makes the game an interactive visual novel at some point, where sometimes you have to watch more than 10 minutes long cutscene sequence, which most of them are either awkward to watch (thanks to the weird English voice lines) or they are unnecessary. True, you can skip them, but they are hard to watch if you would like to know more of the game. The cathedral area in Code Vein is in my top 5 most confusing level in video game list, the other levels were fine. Some of the enemies don't feel unique to me, because most of them use the same move set, even the same weapons, they just have different visuals. The game is surprisingly easy for the most part, thanks to the AI partner you can have throughout the game. They are quite effective and they can carry you to the end most of the time, if they don't behave stupidly. This may sound weird to bring up as a negative, but it is a souls-like game after all, and I expected the game to be difficult. Saving your progress was a bit weird for me, as if you leave the game through the quick menu, that doesn't save your game, but only through the mistles (similar thing to bonfire).For the record, I haven't played the DLCs, but I aim to try them sometimes. I will update the review, when I get the chance.With all of the mentioned issues above, it looked like the game is just not for me, however as I tried to get more invested in the story and build, I started to enjoy it more, there are some good twists in the game, the awkward cutscenes and voice lines were good to laugh at and I started to enjoy more the loadout system. I also started to get all of the achivements, which are not too grindy to get either. Maybe this is not the ""most souls-like game"" ever, but it has an own flow and vibe. I can recommend it if you like ""casual souls-like"" games and/or if the art style made you interested.			"

"
Recommended,44.4,"																Bought this game because I like soulslikes and I like anime, so I figured this would be a good combo, but I was off the mark.Firstly, I beat this game without a partner, which is choosing to suffer, so take this review with a grain of salt. With that however, the difficulty is optional, which isn't unique to games but is different for a souls game. The partnership system takes away any intimacy you can have with an enemy, you don't have to learn the intricacies of a boss or the tells of their attacks if your partner can take their aggro and demolish their HP while the boss is aggro on you. It took me 1 try to beat a boss it took 10 tries to defeat solo.The boss design varies, there were a few fun fights but it is abundantly clear that they allowed flaws in their boss design because the partnership system weighs the fights too heavily in the players favour. There are bosses in this game that have zero tells on their attacks yet the attacks clean out your entire health bar. I have two requirements for souls bosses, and that is: good tells that aren't overly obvious or cruel, and the ability to allow the player to breath to assess their situation every now and then, these bosses are relentless with almost none, to no tells. However, as I said, there were a few fun fights in this game, and some of the bosses could be fixed if you could just remove one horrible attack.The weapons system is just abysmal, I found a weapon in level 3 that stuck with me the entire game, all weapons are super close in damage regardless of where you find them, the weapons in the end-game level are worse than the early-game ones. Progression is poor, to the point levelling up costs you 100,000 souls or 'haze', but grants you +2 attack.The only thing I can say about the level design in this game is 'big corridors' and 'destroyed city in different colours', so don't expect much there.The biggest and most detrimental factor to my enjoyment of this game however, is inconsistency. It is plagued with inconsistency in every facet, to the fact you are fighting enemies from the first level, in the last level, except they have a ton of health, or sometimes attacks land, sometimes they don't, sometimes your magic hits an enemy and stuns them, sometimes it won't, sometimes your weapon reaches the enemy, sometimes it's a toothpick. The enemies may be unique to their environment, or they are the same generic enemies you see everywhere. If you press dodge, 90% of time you will dodge the attack, but the 10% will show its face and kill you at the worst place for it to.This game caused me a lot of grief, and by the end, I was too committed to put it down, it wasn't a completely bad experience, the title screen blew me away deviously. But, there are good aspects to this game, the unique abilities you have are great when you are allowed to use them creatively, the items were fun and interesting, and the story was great for 3/4ths of the game. All I can say is, buy this game if you're looking for a downgraded anime Dark Souls that you will mess around with, and play with the AI partners, but if you're looking for a decent soulslike, look elsewhere.			"
Recommended,41.2,"																The best aspects of the game as compared to Dark Souls are this:Extensive character customization. Yes, you can somewhat change the booba size.Adjustable difficulty -- you can use the in-game NPC/follower to help you deal with monsters. It's great.Story is engaging for what it is (more so if you like anime). It's not a masterpiece, but it isn't boring either.Unique character classes that you can adapt and modify during your run. This sort of flexibility makes it fun to try and complete the same level using a different approach.Easy to get into -- I haven't played anything like Dark Souls before, but I think that this game is a great entry into souls-like.To sum it up, if you like anime and challenge, you will most likely enjoy the game. Personally, I haven't completed it yet, but I'm looking forward to it once I have more free time.			"
Recommended,20.1,"																NOTE: This is MY opinion on the game, if you disagree then that's fine.I personally love this game. a lot of people compared it to dark souls but its a lot closer to the GOD EATER series with a Dark Souls sort of idea behind it. there is a lot to the game ranging from weapons, blood codes, side quests, lore, skills, builds, etc. I would recommend catching the game on sale as the 80$ CDN price tag is a bit high (if you can afford it then go ahead but i'm cheap and prefer spending less money) Pros:Story is greatGame Play is well polishedDifficulty is well done, falls under ""easy yet hard"" (easy to pick up, semi hard to be amazing at the game)Companion IS optionalWeapons have a fair varietyBlood codes aren't locking you into a single play styleNo bugs (or very little. haven't seen any myself)Combat is smooth and easy to start offBig Anime TiddiesCons:Price tag(imo. read up for more info)AI can be a bit... stupid... to say the least (staying within attacks from bosses/enemies when trying to heal themselves)Vestige Walks(as i like to call them) are a bit slow (you have the option to skip most at least)Difficulty Spike can make things a bit rough if you are unprepared			"

Also I would highly recommend a Reshade of a kind, it makes the game look that much better			"
Recommended,296.2,"																Alright, so I've played this game quite a bit now, and I can say with 100% certainty that I've loved every minute of it. If you were a Dark Souls/Bloodborne fan looking for a new game to scratch that itch, this one is definitely worth looking into. This is also one of the few games I'd say is actually also worth $60, whether you're playing solo or with a friend.My personal takeaways: - beautiful graphics- Souls-like combat mechanics (DONE RIGHT), with a bit of an extra twist to it with the way ""Gifts""/Skills work     - also, this game rewards aggression, similar to Bloodborne, where players are subtly encouraged to keep fighting, rather than hiding back behind a shield passively. Multiple different battle options are still available and able to be intricately customized, however- plenty of area and open-world to explore; lots of hidden items for those who love to scavenge, but nothing game-breaking for those who don't care for it- fleshed-out story characters + intricate story lore- character customization is stellar and if you're anything like me, you'll spend literal hours in itOverall, I think this is my pick for the 2019 GOTY, hands down. It's got that Souls feel to it, but otherwise you are getting such a unique experience that no other games like this have yet to offer.			"
Recommended,21.3,"																While I don't hate Code Vein, I'm also not enjoying it.  I'm enjoying the story so far, mostly everything else feels lacking at its core.  There are a lot of cool ideas like blood codes, but everything feels like it wasn't fully fleshed out.  The idea of blood codes are cool and there are a ton of them to choose from but the problem is most of them are useless outside of learning a skill or two then moving on.  There are no builds in the traditional way as when you level up your stats are automatically allocated.  You can however change your blood code, which is essentially a 'class' then assign passives and abilities you've learned from other blood codes to make a 'build'In terms of the game being boring, the environments are one of the worst offenders.  Most are uninspired and dull, like the devs thought adding a bunch of glowing rock pillars everywhere was going to make the game look cool but ended up relying too much on it.  There are a lot of brown/cavern-like areas in the game and destroyed cityscapes.  Level design could use a lot of work in some areas (I'm looking at you, white castle maze)Honestly the only reason I feel this game is getting so positively reviewed is because thirsty the character creator is incredibly well done, so thirsty anime fans are creating their favourite waifus.  Seriously..look at the community page or codevein subreddit...Difficulty-wise, the game is at a good point.  If you want to make it a bit easier, you can take an OP NPC ally with you to do most of the heavy lifting.Don't get me wrong, the game isn't BAD, maybe worth closer to a $30 cad pricetag though.  You can tell a lot of work went into the game but at the end of the day it feels like a shallow no-name version of darksouls with a dash of god eater.			"
Recommended,159.6,"																Anime SoulsGood game with an excellent character creator, many weapon and skill options and interesting characters.It's well worth the experience when the game is on sale. I wouldn't recommend it that much at full price though.The character creator and the anime aesthetic in a souls-like game are probably enough to justify the purchase, aligned with good side characters and story. However, the game's combat is not that good compared to other games of the genre and the difficulty spikes might cause a little frustration.It's a great game and a brand new IP that has it's own uniqueness. It has its flaws, but considering that it's a first take of the studio on a souls-like game, they did a good job and a second game has a lot of potential to become one of the pillars of the genre alongside Nioh and Dark Souls.Good:Excellent character creator. Can create your own Souls waifu; There aren't many games with anime character creators at this level and I've seen amazing creations on the community hub. Interesting story and characters with great designs and their own background stories. The character's visuals alone are probably why you're buying this lolMany types of weapons, skills and builds that can be changed at any time. Can also inherit skills from different Cores to others. Depending on how you build, can change the results dramatically, especially when dealing with bosses.Satisfying progress and leveling, as expected from a Souls-like game. Deep exploration and puzzling with many forks leading to different areas or interconnect previous areas.Good PC Port. Runs perfectly at 1440p60 Max on a RTX 2060 Super. Graphics and art style look really good and the frame rate is smooth and stable. Stutters just a little bit when loading new areas but that's a very known Unreal Engine problem.Takes about 30 hours to finish. I know it has multiple endings and a lot of missable stuff related to the story. I ended up watching the endings on YouTube, but there's a NG+ that carries over everything to unlock the endings.Bad:Memory vestige restoration is incredibly boring, where you just walk and look at static objects with voice which represents the character's past. The stories looked interesting though since it's an important part of character development and better understanding of the story, but the way it was executed made me feel like skipping a lot of it.Combat is not a prime example of the genre. It's slow and a bit clunky. Healing is the worst part of this game lolDifficulty spikes and balancing issues are real. It's not that hard overall, but some bosses are very cheap with amazing range, speed and damage while others are very easy.Relies a lot on the companion's help and damage output to play effectively.Most of the items you get through exploration are useless.

Recommended,29.5,"																Hmmmm. Code Vein....Code Vein. What can I say? Things about I really loved. Making a beautiful Waifu, spending hours just loving on her, and bringing her to perfection were great. There were some really tough instances within the game that made me think, hey! is this Dark Souls? There were some parts though where it was like eh? I can't find my way through this stinkin' map, I am on my knees at this point and time begging for the way to progress; that part stunk. The cut-scenes were emotional they cut me like a knife. It was interesting learning about my fellow husbandos and waifus. The boss fights really easy first time around, some of them tho, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Recommended,29.8,"																Now this is a souls-like I can get behind! They even went ahead and ripped off one of the most famous dark souls environments and put it in their game, and you know what? I don’t mind a bit. At least this game put a ton of effort into its environment, beautifully done in sort of a weebish art-style. Unlike Nioh with it’s unimaginative drab color palette. Hell, one biome is so bright in this game you almost need sunglasses to make it through, lest you’re seeing spots for 2 days!The story was somewhat interesting. I’m not into anime, but I imagine those who are could get behind it. And yes this game has the over exaggerated anime body types for the females. So if you’re into that, going ahead and dive in headfirst!Now for the bad parts, the bosses. Unlike the environment and exploration, the bosses are lackluster, with many cheap explosions that are hard to avoid… So I just built a tank and powered through them. If we could have Nioh Bosses and everything else from this game then we’d have something. I truly hope the game did well enough to make a sequel, because this is a solid foundation. 			"

Not Recommended,89.7,"																Code Vein could be best described as a Dark Souls clone with an anime visual style, and a shameless clone it is in many ways. The death system, bonfires, dodge-roll combat, weapon and armor upgrade system, and so many small things up to lack of a pause feature and a fat-skinny Orstein and Smough rip off at almost exactly the same mid-late point in the game. This would all be unforgivable if From Software didn’t close the book on the games, but the gameplay is quite good. The mana and class system are a unique twist and you can switch roles on the fly; you can ultimately do everything on one character. The gameplay is fun and varied and stacks up to its inspiration.My biggest issue with the game is the part that is jarringly separated from the gameplay. Whereas the Souls series buried its lore and story in the gameplay and kept cut scenes minimal by today’s standards, Code Vein does the complete opposite and presents the entire story through cut scenes and dialogue, like most games - and your character is not the protagonist, but a mute tool that tags along, and apparently the writers creative juices were all poured into some strange respirator mask fetish because the story is C- Anime/Video Game nonsense. It’s not stupid enough to be amusing, like Bayonetta, or bad enough to be funny like the original Resident Evil, it’s just that boring, painfully mediocre level that keeps you from skipping cut scenes in hopes that it gets better. All of your familiar cast is here:-Unreasonably altruistic protagonist whose blind acts of trust always work out-Stoic samurai who is really into rice balls-Strong independent girl who never wins a fight and gasps a lot-Squeaky teenage girl who is really into gadgets-Innocent maiden who is sworn to protect everyone but never actually does anything-and more!And of course, they are all voiced over by the same troupe who has apparently voiced over every anime/video game translation since the ‘90s. Are they filthy rich or run ragged? They definitely earned their pay in Code Vein, because these frenzied, aggressive bosses will still wait for a hero to clench his fist and explain why he can’t run away before everyone else explains why they will stand by him, complete with dramatic pauses, then on to the boss!So, I quickly developed a love/hate relationship with this games gameplay/story but the story is skippable and it’s hard to find games with this level of character customization and fun combat, so the gameplay wins in the end.

Recommended,4.4,"																First off it took me more like 30hrs to complete my first playthrough but i wasn't signed in to Steam during a massive 8 hour session so it didn't log. Yes i said 8 hours I was fully immersed into the game world and having a great time exploring and clapping cheeks. Oh and my cheeks got clapped their fair share as well. At first I was having like an insane time but once Gifts started taking forever to level up and I locked into my Halberd build full swing and stopped experimenting it kinda lost some enthusiasm. The character creator/waifu simulator is actually one of the best in any game I spent over an hour just on that. It does suffer from the same issue as Scholar of the first sin tho far too many gank squads and not a huge variety of enemies. Stand out bosses include Water Stripper Waifu(rekt me) Tittie Fire Doggo and something do to with a throat. Level design is predictable if you've got Souls experience but it does the job pretty well. Pretty high replay value as there is a ton of different Gifts(spells) weapons and Blood Codes(classes) messing around with all that is solid. Some bosses had some bs hit detection but maybe I just needed to Git Gud. Satisfied customer overall recommend for waifu and souls fans. 8.6/10			"
Recommended,23.8,"																Some of the gameplay is fun, but the difficulty is all about enemies overwhelming you and bypassing your dodges and parries.  The mechanics work most of the time, but when four enemies attack, one of them will hit.  And sometimes a single enemy will have so much time on their attack animation that even if you dodge, you still get hit by the end of the attack. Bosses tend to completely change it all up and it just becomes a massive aoe fest that you just sort of stumble through until you get lucky and win the fight. The story is decent, but for replayability they have four endings.  One ending is like one word different from one of the others.  And three of the endings require you to either be blind or play badly to manage to get them.  The ng+ is okay and some people must like it, but I don't see it as really giving any additional challenge or replayability because as I said, most of the difficulty is just enemies swarming you or attacks that can't really be dodged.  That isn't really going to change in ng+. Overall, I am playing through it, but youtube is going to satisfy me for the extra endings.  There goes a couple achievements but the game isn't good enough to make me play it twice.			"

Recommended,54.8,"																I won't go into too much detail because I don't care enough for this game, I just think it's ridiculous how positively this game is rated. The game has a few interesting ideas, like the ""classes"" that allow you to perfect skills to use them while playing a different class, or the fact that you can change encounters if you collect all the memories. But that's pretty much where the positives end. And speaking of the memory system...I think I have never seen such a bad way to deliver story. You slowly walk through a void of nothing, look at a still image for 2 minutes straight while inconsistently interesting monologues are playing in the background, then you continue to slow walk to the next still image you can look at for another 2 minutes. The worst part of this? You can't even skip any of it. Want to collect everything but aren't interested in the (pretty generic) story? Too bad. Don't care for the voiceacting and can read the subtitles faster than than they talk? Prepare for your flow of reading to get ♥♥♥♥♥.I don't even know which part to rant about next, there are so many bad ones. How about visual design? Yes, the game has an anime aesthetic and that isn't for everyone, ain't for me either, but that shouldn't really make or brake a game for anyone. But being anime doesn't give you an excuse to be SO HORNY. If the sheer size of the breasticles didn't make that clear enough, THE TITS HAVE CLOTH PHYSICS AND SWAY IN THE WIND FOR ♥♥♥♥♥ SAKE. Even enemies that are otherwise serious or even grotesque in design have asscheeks and tiddies that are individually twice the size of my head, and I have a big ass head. This game throws a bad light on weebs. I'm offended and I'm not even anything close to a weeb.On a similar note, the character creator (the very first thing you get to customise is boob size btw) isn't as good as it could have been either. Yes, it has an insane amount of customisation options, but that doesn't help a whole lot when everything clips through everything else, which is very annoying. The movement animations are horrible and combat is way too clunky, almost being on par with lords of the fallen at times. Difficulty wise, don't go into this game expecting anything even closely resembling dark souls and other fromsoft games. The game, most of the time, is piss easy but then comes around and slaps you in the face big pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Which is where most of the difficulty in this game comes from. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is a rough estimate of one half of one boss that feels challanging, like it's your fault when you lose. The rest are pushovers or horrbily balanced.There are of course a lot more problems, like the servicible at best, but boring, tedious and downright horrible at worst, level design, the potential grind or the bugs, but I won't go into that right now.There is a way to kinda circumvent some of the problems: multiplayer. First of all, the game seems to be balanced around having a partner, be it an AI companion or a friend, with the friend clearly being the better option. It takes away a bunch of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty (and adds a lot more pushovers), but most importantly, you can make fun of the game while playing it. Laughable amount of horny? Goes from irritating to funny. Clipping making you unable to take the character creator seriously? Becomes a competition of who can make the funniest character (and believe me, it isn't short of rediculous options). Sitting through 20min of memories again? Just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ talk to one another. Doesn't make the game good, but at least you can have at least a bit of a fun time			"
Recommended,37,"																After sinking quite a few hours into the game since release, here my review so far.I'm now halfway through my first NG+ playthrough.After Re-Reading I noticed that most of my negative points are small QoL's that don't make the game unplayable but I'd love to see introduced. Don't take them too serious.Game +/-+ Amazing Character Creation- Accessory amount you can use is locked :(+ Good Difficulty Scaling: Play Solo or with AI/Online Friend Help to make it harder/easier+ Story is very solid, worth to pay attention to+ Music is top tier+ Insane amount of different ways to play - Balance might be a bit off between different builds/weapons and needs adjustments- No way to pre-save sets which is a MUST in this game- NG+ locks you out of buyable materials you could buy at the end of the normal mode for whatever reason? I didn't know this and now NG+ is really hard for me considering I only have 1 +10 weapon which I need to build around or use +3 weapons.- NG+ makes you ""rewatch"" all vertiges (i know you can skip em) but it shouldn't be needed.+ Fanservice waifus- Too much fanservice sometimes :^) you know whom I'm talking about+ Very good English VAHow does it run?+ So far 0 crashes+ Easily runs at 144fps (I do have a 2080ti tho.)+ Overall smooth experience besides the ALREADY FIXED BUG of the 60+ frames.+ Looks really nice on PC even tho it's a console Game.Overall, I'd give the game 9/10. I'm having a lot of fun doing a Solo NG+ run right now, the difficulty is there and it feels challenging. I'm not someone to usually play any soloplayer games (besides Nier) but I consider this one of the better games. Definitely worth grabbing.Small QoL's would be SUPER appreciated tbh.

Not Recommended,35.8,"																I have not finished the game, but I just wanted to give my initial thoughts on the overall game so far in terms of music, gameplay & design.Honestly, I really like this game. It's not up there with Dark Souls, but the style is basically the same - (Instead of bonfires you rest at something called 'Mistles', you can lock onto enemies the same way, controls are generally the same & the rolling mechanic is the same as Dark Souls). The music is really good in my opinion, and definitely has a great soundtrack for this type of game. The game also runs really well. The optimization is smooth on my 1050ti + i5 processor w/ 16 GB of ram at the highest settings. Character customization is so much better than I thought. I spent over 20-30 minutes just customizing my character because the customization in the game goes so in depth, as it gives you many options to choose from and allows you to make your character look however you want him/her to look. Of course, throughout the game you collect new abilities, perks & new ways to level up your character in order to increase strength, health, stamina, etc. On the other hand, this game does have its flaws. This isn't exactly a huge issue - (Keep in mind this is only my first run, and I still have not finished the game), but the game feels easy when you have an A.I. partner with you. It seems they do a lot of the work, and take away a lot of the tension. By yourself, the game is more difficult, but with an A.I. teammate, the game feels easier. I've seen people complain about no ultra widescreen support, but I can't confirm since I simply use 1920x1080. Also, a few people have said that the game won't detect their controllers, but I have had no issues at all. I plug in my Xbox One controller and the game instantly detects it. I may change my review after I fully finish the game, but I am a huge Dark Souls fan, so this game really interested me. The anime style is also very well-done. People like to call this game the ""Anime Dark Souls"", and that is essentially what it is. Overall, it's by no means perfect. However, whether you're a dark souls style fan or not, I think this game is definitely worth a buy. Solid 8/10 game.			"
Not Recommended,18.3,"																Difficult games, especially souls-like games, induce those moments where you just want to quit the game forever. However, as mentioned in my Sekiro review, if you decide to invest time into overcoming the learning curve, you get to roast the game for trying to roast you. But do not fear, as I think this game’s difficulty ceiling is nowhere near as high as Sekiro’s. In fact, you have the option of buffing or keeping the difficulty as you enter NG+ cycles.One thing that stands out about Code Vein among other souls-like games is definitely the character customization. In my opinion, the options are more vast compared to other anime games with character customization like the newer Fire Emblem games. Because of the numerous combinations, it gives each player a unique identity in the game if they choose to play with the options. And while you may laugh at your college roommate for his or her character, you have to remember that his or her character is not your character, and it shouldn’t stop you from creating the character you want to make. By making the character you want, the playthrough will feel more personal and special to you because of the choices that no one else made. You can also make changes in the middle of the playthrough, so there is no pressure to make sure you will like the character you made at the very start.Compared to other souls-like games, there is also an enjoyable combat system. There are a variety of “classes” in the game called Blood Codes. Depending on which Blood Code is equipped (which can be changed freely), you will gain special abilities and stats will be changed in response to the playstyle based off of the Blood Code. While not all Blood Codes are equally powerful, you shouldn’t expect to stomp through every boss with the same Blood Code. A blood code that focuses on melee power may work for one boss, but may not work for another.While I can go on about the positives about this game, I have to address the fanservice. I think Code Vein is in a similar situation to Xenoblade Chronicles 2 when it comes to fanservice. What I mean is that both games do contain fanservice and to a similar extent, but I think it is seen in too much of a negative light when it mostly lies in skimpy outfits and hot springs. While you can’t control the outfits of other characters that have skimpy outfits in both games, you do have the option of choosing outfits for your own character, so you do have freedom with seeing or not seeing fanservice. The hot springs are optional in both games, so you do have even more flexibility with what you do and do not want to see. Overall, the inclusion of fanservice may turn players away, but I don’t think it is bad as it is made out to be because it is not over saturating the game and it is not shoved in the player’s face in contrast to the Neptunia series.In conclusion, if you like Dark Souls and don’t mind (or like) anime, I would recommend giving this game a shot. If you are skeptical about buying this game, you should find some videos online to help decide.			"
Not Recommended,24.8,"																5/10Not a bad game, it´s just too ""meh"".Combat is repetitive, enemies are all the same with little variety. Leveling up or upgrading gear does not make you feel better (stats do change ofc, but the feeling of getting stronger isn´t there). Story and worldbuilding is sort of ok, but anime characters just don´t fit there. However, I´m not denying that female characters were nice to look at...Worst part is level design. While levels alone are fine but nothing special, world layout does not make any sense. For instance, you are in snowy mountains, then you run maybe 30 seconds thru few hallways that serve as level transition, and then boom, you are in a burning city. If you look around, there is no trace of mountains you were at earlier. After burning city level, you go on foot to sand city and again, if you look back behind map borders where you basically came from, there is no hint of burning city. So in the end, everything is randomly sticked together.All put together, every part of Code Vein is average at best, and has more cons than pros.			"
Recommended,115.8,"																Was the delay and wait worth it?... The answer is yes. It was. I'm impressed by this title. Its amazingly good. Haven been playing it non-stop during the weekend. The narrative is really strong, gameplay is great, has a really cool class system that you can learn and inherit skills from other classes to use on any class, therefore making your own special skill set. All the weapons feel strong and useful one way or another. some might seem weak at first, but thats because they work diferently from others.If you're on the fence of buying this game, I recommend doing so. The narrative style and characters are really cool.This game is worth every penny it asks for, really strong exploration and the amazing character creator and gameplay made me rethink my GOTY for this year to be Code Vein.(will write a more extensive review after completing the story or when I feel ready.)

The overall aesthetic is nice, even tho all the characters definately meet all of your standard anime weeb tropes. The character creation overall is some of the most amazing I have seen in any title that offers CaC and you can easily create whatever ya want from waifu/husbando to absolute monstrocity. Overall gameplay so far seems like a mix of a typical souls title and an action rpg that decided to have an unholy child together. There is some weight to strikes, though the emphasis is more on dodging and hit and run like your typical friendly Dark Souls, though at the same time, it can feel a little button mash happy with light attacks. Now in all fairness, there is some jank, such as wonky hitboxes and also the beginning does have a bit of your character sliding around like physics decided it wanted a coffee break. In my honest opinion, as the game stands without updates and dlc, I would give it a solid 7.5/10.			"

Not Recommended,19.2,"																As much as I'd like to recommend this game, I'm unable to do so. The core gameplay is centered around the souls-like mechanic with a flair of its own, which completely fails to make any difference whatsoever in my opinion. There are Blood Codes (i.e. classes) you can change to, but the system is somewhat flawed when you consider the possibility of merely juggling the classes around to make the stats interesting for the equipment you're trying to equip instead of actually changing the way you play the game. It's one of those systems where you won't feel stronger or better equipped no matter what you're using. I was level 150 when I finished the game, with +10 weapons and armor, and I was barely escaping one hit kills from the last bosses of the game. Another very distressing point is that its almost impossible to explore the world and fight the monsters alone. You'll need either a friend and/or an AI companion to have a mild chance to survive. And yeah, it all goes down the drain in the boss fights, where the difficulty spikes. I'm no stranger to hard games and I'm able to recognize an unfair game when I play one.The biggest flaw of the game, however, is its presentation. The world is VERY stale, boring and samey. The same goes about the enemies. The level design compresses the world into a neverending network of mazes, no matter if you're exploring a city or a cave. The soundtrack is unbearably boring, making you listen to the SAME battle music the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sob sob sad music that plays during EVERY SINGLE flashback. Speaking of which, prepare to sit through one of the most boring storytelling you've probably ever seen. It wouldn't be a problem if the story was interesting, which it isn't, unfortunately. It's just another weeb story full of ♥♥♥♥.It feels like the entire budget of the game went to the very detailed character creator, which is the game's biggest selling point. It's very detailed and you'll be able to create beautiful characters with a very pleasing anime aesthetic. If you're into anime boobies and hotties then boi, you're in for a trip. Too bad the game puts these beautiful characters in a world and story boring to the bone. Don't forget to use the photo mode because that's the best feature of the game. Just don't be a degenerate and check under the girls' skirts. Please don't do that. Don't disappoint me. You wouldn't do that, would you?  totally do that, boi I'd love to have my cute anime badass catgirl warrior explore a world full of content, with a cool story and meaningful gameplay. Too bad none of that happens. It's just a stale souls-like game with a overly presumptuous weeb story.			"

Recommended,39.3,"																Your game is going to have a tough time when everyone compares it to DarkSouls right from the start, and unfortunately this game isn't better than DarkSouls (be honest, we will not have a game that beats DS for a long time), but Code Vein is still a really good game.I really like the way the classes, or ""Blood Codes"" work; instead if leveling your stats i.e. leveling Str to 40 and Dex to 30, you only level your character, and your stats are distributed depending on what Blood Code you have equipped using a rating system. You can swap your Blood Code like you would swap any item your have equipped. The different Blood Codes give you different abilities, and once you have ""mastered"" an ability you can use it with other Blood Codes, so your combinations is practically unlimited.The story is mostly told with cut-scenes; some would prefer this ""show me the story instead of me having to find it"" way of doing things but I would have preferred the cut-scenes to occur a little bit less.The character designs are awesome. Its so good even the feminists are raging about it!! If you like your fantasy anime you will love this game.As for the technical details of the game; it runs on the Unreal engine so you can expect good performance on a variety machines. Graphical settings all of a ""Low/Medium/High"" type. Frame capping is not a problem, you can set it from 30 to 144 and higher in the settings. With a RTX 2070 I am at 60fps 100% of the time, and I am sure you will be able to do the same on a much slower card.			"

Recommended,52.7,"																First review, so bear it with me.For starters, it took me 54 hours to complete my first run, primarily because I was trying to get everything (and failed). This is also my first Souls-like too, tho this isn't the reason why I bought and played this game.First off, starting with the obvious point - this is very anime. If you don't like the anime aesthetics, you probably won't like this game. It's a bit of a slow burn in the first 2-3 hours if you are someone who is going in blind.The story is meh. Very straight forward like in a typical anime. Not necessarily bad, the plot is actually great if you think about but it really feels like the story is there for the sole purpose for it to be there. Honestly, building your relationships with the characters themselves and the journey to the end itself mattered way more than the story itself.If you try to dig deeper, you might find some lore/story elements that the game doesn't explicitly tell you but that's up to you to figure out, if you are into this stuff.Decent character creator, you can spend hours on making and customizing your characters. This is probably one of the best and most detailed anime character creator out there.Although I think that there is still places for improvement. For example, lack of clothing variety (only 6-7 clothes choices with the options to remove stuff like sleeves for example) and the hairstyles choices feel rather inflated (as half of the hairstyles are really just a mirror variations). Also, sometimes hair clipping through your character's face or hat can happen too, especially during cutscenes and it doesn't look good IMO. If this game ever gets a sequel, I really wish the devs would try and improve on that....Weapon and armour designs, on other hand, are up in my valley.Level design is meh, I guess. I really don't care about that, with the exception of the Cathedral (which admittedly can be a pain in the ass even on later runs).Class builds system has a huge potential and you can switch them on the fly, although be aware that you won't get all possible classes right of the bat. That being said, it is perfect for virtually any play-style.Combat system is a bit of hit-or-miss. Stuff like parry and backstabbing takes awhile to master.The voice acting is okay. Sound, music and OST is okay too.TL;DR:Overall, a solid 7/10.I suggest buying the Deluxe Edition when on sale. I made the mistake of buying the standard edition only. Also don't bother with the DLC			"
Recommended,39.5,"																CODE VEIN is an anime-themed souls-like where you play as a Revenant who lives in a post-apocalyptic world where you need blood-themed things to survive and have blood-themed powers. I'll be splitting my review into sections in order to cover the major points.StoryThe story is pretty meh. It's confusing, disconnected, and pretty boring. When you first enter the world, you are just introduced to people who you know nothing about. I understand the game decided to go with the standard ""protagonist is an amnesiac with a special gift"" trope, but there wasn't a need to make the players feel so disconnected from the game's world. The game has an issue of properly explaining what certain things are to you. I thought this feeling of disinterest and confusion would wane as I got to know the characters and the world more, but that never happened, as I found myself not caring about the story points of anyone in the story. There were absolutely zero instances where I felt genuine emotion. I was just watching dramatic events unfold with characters I wasn't made to care about. If I actually was made to like these characters or got to know them, then these plot points would have more influence on me, but alas.Also, most of these bosses just feel like random designs the developers thought were cool and fit the environment. There isn't any buildup, reasoning, or story behind these bosses. They are just there because this is a souls-like place where you need to fight bosses and nothing else. Due to my lack of familiarity with souls-likes, I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence, but even if it is, I found it quite lame. GameplayThe gameplay would be good if it weren't brought down by one of the worst things in this game: the ""co-op."" The ""co-op"" aspect is horribly flawed. The main appeal this game had for me was that I could play it with my friend, but it was immensely disappointing when we realized that this feature was severely limited. Talking a bit more about the co-op's horrible mechanics, I need to make it clear that the person who is a ""guest"" in the main player's world is SEVERELY limited in what they can do. You can't open doors, you can't open chests, you can't see certain items, and you even get outright kicked from the session if you were to die. What makes this worse is that there are no clear indications of these restrictions. The game is also very selective in the scenes you can view with your co-op partner. For instance, whenever you beat a boss, your co-op partner is kicked from the game and can't join back until you complete around 10-40 minutes of the post-boss fight content. The progress you made in the host world also doesn't save for them, and you both need to essentially play the entire area twice in order to progress through the game together. Mistles also function as the main way to save the game, heal, access upgrades, change classes, and refill healing items. However, they aren't allowed in co-op game sessions, so they essentially become useless if you want to play with a friend. The sheer number of oversights and outright anti-player design elements makes you wonder if they allocated all of their effort to character customization rather than the ""co-op"" experience (and even that wasn't the best). However, suppose you're able to ignore the trainwreck that is this game's co-op system. In that case, you can see that the gameplay has a ton of different classes (blood codes), abilities (gifts), weapons, and items that allow for a ton of customization in the way you play the game. Early on, the gameplay is a bit boring, but as you get more access to different build options, it becomes more engaging. The gameplay is pretty good overall, but it was a bit more on the boring side for me. The gameplay becomes even more boring in co-op, as the game doesn't seem balanced for co-op play due to the sheer ease of boss encounters. It's to the point where the actual level is much harder than any of the bosses.Character CustomizationThe character customization in this game is also really expansive, and you can tell the developers put a lot of work into crafting it. There are a ton of things you can customize, from your body type to the way light reflects off of your eyes. However, this is the end of my praise on this part, as you start to notice that in order to have this wide array of options, the developers made a MAJOR compromise in the quality of these customization options. Your character's expressions are practically nonexistent; your hair will ALWAYS clip through anything in its path; movement looks clunky with PC controls; you hold your weapons weirdly (especially when blocking), and more. You can just see the sheer amount of compromises the developers made in providing all the customization options. But, hell, even in the customization options, there were serious discrepancies in the amount of customization you can perform on your character. For instance, there are like 50-100 options on the eyebrows of your character but less than ten options for clothing. Map DesignEven with my lack of knowledge regarding the way traditional souls-likes function, I'm aware that map design plays a huge role in whether you like a game in this genre or not. Sadly, here, the map design is lacking tremendously. Either the maps are boring, confusing, or just downright frustrating. Areas such as the Cathedral of Sacred Blood or the Howling Pit are just a pain to navigate, as the game actively makes it a chore for you to simply traverse the map, let alone battling the enemies within the map or reaching checkpoints. Some maps also make finding the vestiges and save points extremely cumbersome, to the point where you will genuinely miss them if you aren't looking in every nook and cranny of the map. Hell, there were times when I would need to burst open some random crate to find an essential key to even traverse to another portion of the map, so this isn't even an issue that is only limited to the ""optional"" upgrade components. However, despite the functionality of these locations being quite miserable or boring, I found their designs to be quite endearing at times. Despite the Cathedral of Sacred Blood being a misery-inducing experience to go through, I found that the visuals of the environment and enemies helped soothe the frustration I constantly felt festering within me while traversing the god-forsaken maze.Music and Sound DesignThis game has a serious issue with the variety of its music. I normally wouldn't make a big deal about music if it was serviceable, but in this game, every single ""non-animated"" cutscene that features individuals as stone figures has the SAME SONG EVERY TIME. It doesn't help that these cutscenes are typically really boring to play through, so it becomes quite irritating to listen to this same song whenever you need to go through these horrible cutscenes. Sure, I can just skip them, but that is another issue in itself. I've also noticed that the game loves reusing the same music tracks for other events like fight encounters and certain animated cutscenes. Final ThoughtsOverall, CODE VEIN is a game that had a lot of potential, but ultimately let me down in many aspects. I thought this would be a very fun game to play with my friend where I could have a great customization system with engaging gameplay and skills, but as I've stated before, this just wasn't the reality. This may just be the ramblings of someone who doesn't like the structure of souls-likes, but I just don't understand who really would enjoy this game. I guess you can give this a try if you aren't trying to play co-op or achievement hunt, but if you are in either of those crowds, then I HIGHLY recommend NOT playing this game.			"
Recommended,33.8,"																This game is well worth the price of admission.  There are a few bugs with the game, but those can be ironed out with updates.  The combat is on point and is a nice mesh of Dark Souls with the God Eater formula.  It's very heavily anime inspired as well, and for me that is only a plus since I am a huge fan of the Tales of franchise and other heavily anime inspired JRPGs.  Go and look at the videos of people playing this game if you are still on the fence.  If it looks like something you can get into, I say give it a go.  If it doesn't look like your cup of tea, then save your money for something you will enjoy.  I say the same thing about every game I play.  Go off your own instincts.  And do NOT listen to game journalists, they aren't actually reviewing the game honestly and are tanking the reviews of the game for made up nonsense in their head.  The game is not sexist, it's about as egalitarian as you can possibly get.  You have men and women trying to save the world as a plot point.  Which makes it your typical anime JRPG affair.			"

Recommended,15,"																Overall good game if you like souls games and anime.Pro's: Framerate is pretty stable, a few drops at area intersection points. (I'm playing on max           all settings with a GTX 1660 TI in 1080p.)          Character customization is very deep, though no body options(limited bob slider)          Level design is pretty good if you like exploration though it does get confusing.          Interesting class system          Great controller support          Physics          Lot's of contentCon's: My biggest problem with code vein is the difficulty is too low especially at the start of            the game, some of the encounters are also way too difficult. The blood scent            encounters where the game just throws dozens of mobs at you are an example, but            overall the game is way easier than what I had hoped for. The other big issue I have is            the limited body customization specifically for female characters. The game let's you            choose bust size but doesn't let you have as big or as small as many of the in-game            characters. It feels like they're waving it in your face and you can't have it. The mob AI            is also very predictable. For example using a healing item will get you agro 100% of            the time. Certain AI partners are very overpowered compared to others.Not a bad game all in all with some minor issues. Definitely a must-buy for souls fans, anime fans and anyone who loves exploration/collection.			"

Recommended,154,"																So far I am liking it. To get it cleared, I got no experience with any dark souls like games what so ever, I did tried one, but died consistently on the first area and can't get pass the 1st boss on bloodborne (skill issue tbh). Then I saw this game where some would say it is a bit easier version of it, and I highly agree with it. I managed to pass 2 bosses now. On factor that helped me is the companions you can bring, none of my friends play this so I am with an AI and they kinda save me (most of the times). Worth buying it on sale and made the right choice on getting it.  I do hope 2 months from now I get the flow of games like this since I do like the anime style than realistic in most games, and the customization of this is one I like. If you are struggling on dark souls like, I think I can suggest this one for ya. Do get it on sale, the Deluxe version tho so DLC included (Haven't done the DLC yet so no review and will edit this when I did try it)			"
Recommended,41.8,"																Yes, I recommend this game to others.  I enjoy the plot, the character customization, how easy and difficult you want it to be, by playing with your friends, choosing to use companions or not, and even new game plus.  Acquiring all the blood codes, veils, and weapons takes a lot of time.  The deluxe edition adds a few 'depth' maps that are bigger than the others with special bosses, nothing amazing, and includes some other things.  If you plan to play NG+, doing the DLC will get you some nice stuff that will help.As for a souls game, it's the only one I bothered to complete, that is apparently souls like, however I've only played the first, and the first one made no sense to me as it was, and I got bored of it.  I'm sure there's a plot in the first one, however after doing the things I was told to do, I really still had no clue what was going on.  Guess it's one of those plots you really gotta look for, or I guess complete the game for, and I wasn't really into the hype of a buggy game being -hard-.  Try some ghosts and goblins on NES, that's hard.  Haha.  Or Metroid without a cheat book.  Try Dark Souls without a cheatbook, pretty sure most needed one.Anyways, this game is amazing to me.  I recommend it.  Buy it or not.  I'm getting my money out of it.  :D			"

Recommended,36.8,"																(TLDR at the end)After playing through this game multiple times and just grinding for that 100% I have to say I love this game. Not surprising anyone, it felt a lot like a Soulsborne, with the fast combat especially Bloodborne, but with anime. It's way more beginner-friendly with the companion system, so even someone who didn't get to experience this kind of gameplay before. Still there's PLENTY of challange by leaving your companion in the base and adventuring alone or NG+. (After you finish a playthrough you get to decide if you want to restart the story at the same or a higher difficulty.) This goes to a point where you will get oneshot by everything, so this should provide a good challange for even the most skilled players.What keeps me playing after the first playthrough and the achievments is the fluent gameplay and the hands down best character creator I have ever seen. There are some boundaries with it, but overall all the characters I wanted to make so far look great and this is still being worked on by the developers so far, with hints to a hight slider for example.BUT: One achievment especially is VERY grind heavy, you basicly need to beat 400 bosses in Coop.What's also missing for me for the game to keep playing for many more hours is PvP. Fashionvein is great and all, but how can I truly show off my creations without PvP? This seems to be a controversal topic in the comunity, but I can hardly see that good reasons against it.TLDR: You like anime or are interested in a Soulsborne? This game will be worth at least one playthrough. This will probably be good enough or at least 70 hours, after that it's a question of if you like the so far limited endgame.			"

Recommended,9.4,"																You know, I actually really dug this one.My reviews tend to ramble, so let me make my bullet point here: Yes, it's good, yes I recommend it, yes it's more accessible than any Souls game, BUT: if you're impatient like me or new to the series/style in general, just use a guide once you get to the Cathedral of Sacred Blood. That zone is early in the game, is EXTREMELY labyrinthine, full of tough enemies, and just full-on SUCKS. The remaining three quarters of the game is much more fun, and WAY more intuitive in terms of navigation,  and that zone in no way indicates how the game will be overall. Power through it, stick with it, and you'll enjoy this game.I was a little surprised, to be honest, because I usually don't buy much that's anime-inspired on Steam, primarily because a LOT of it are either really old JRPGs that I find kinda impenetrable (I've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ around with Disgaea once or twice, but it's not really my thing, and stuff like the Tales series or Skies of Arcadia really aren't for me), and in fact before anyone mentioned this game, when it was recommended to me, I wrote it off as ""just more obscure anime stuff"" and hit ""Ignore"". It wasn't until my birthday that a good friend of mine mentioned it and said ""all I know is it's like Souls with vampires"" and I immediately perked up. Two things guaranteed to get my attention: vampires and ninja. And I know how ridiculous that sounds at my initial claims of ""I don't really do anime stuff that often"".So I'm going to mention right now the thing that most people hear about to the greatest extent when this game comes up: the character creator. Honestly, while I'm impressed and pleased by it, I don't think it really deserves the ""best creator evar"" praise you hear about it. It IS impressive, and it lets you do a lot of things to really fine granularity that others don't, but then it's limited in really bizarre ways to compensate. The best way I can exemplify that is like this: there are easily over a thousand options for eyebrows alone (or damn close to it; I'm really not kidding), and the sheer number of ways to fine-tune your eyes and the specific ways that light shines off them, as well as iris/pupil styles and colors that it's really staggering. Add to that the ""makeup"" options, which really are just ways to adjust things like bags under the eyes, stress marks, scars, all that, and it's really, really cool. However, there is all of ONE body type, really, and only about six clothing options per gender. While it's true that you can customize each option in individual ways (like removing one sleeve cuff off of one set, or editing the scarf of another), by and large, what your character's body looks like under their armor isn't something you can screw with all that much. I set out to make a character based off Magus from Chrono Trigger, and it worked FAIRLY well. I got the long, white hair (no widow's peak options, though), and the perfect eyes (red, small black pupils, no shine, slight bags under them, and ever-so-slightly stern eyebrows). I even managed to get the purple pants, along with brown knee-high boots AND the silver bangle on his right leg (it was too low, though; I couldn't put it around his thigh and it ended up just below his knee). That said, the only glove options that encompassed the forearm were all fingerless (and his aren't), and the only full-fingered gloves went just past the wrist. Most glaringly, there are no cape options whatsoever, the hair wasn't QUITE right (limited brow options), and I couldn't make his shirt the correct shade, either. I believe I got it as good as I could, but not as good as I had hoped with all the legendary appreciation the creator had.Add to that, for female characters, the smallest bust size you'll manage is a GENEROUS double D (and most NPC characters are closer to Hitomi Tanaka, with all of three exceptions, I think), and with both sexes, it's hard to make anyone with a ""flawed"" body type. Pretty much everyone you can churn out is going to be hunky or otherwise very sexed up, which isn't necessarily a problem, but exhibits limits you don't hear about from most people when they talk about it.The class system is really neat; working more like an FF Job System than anything else, except instead of having to master two levels of Ranger of three levels of Caster to unlock Artemis (the next tier up, so to speak, for magic-based characters), you just have to find a class ""Core"" and then seek out its ""Vestiges"" in levels, or occasionally receive them from NPCs or bosses. Being able to change classes on the fly and radically alter your stats is pretty cool, and means that you'll never accidentally make a character who is so weak that you'd be better served starting completely over and using either trial and error or a build guide to make a better one. That's a huge plus.You unlock skills with Haze (souls), and master them by either using them and spending a lot of time as that class, or spending a set of fairly-limited resources to unlock them instantly, which allows you to equip them to buttons even when you're not that class. Getting back to my Magus character concept, by the end, I had a guy who was extremely capable of heavy damage, with an excellent representation of Fire, Ice, and Lightning spells, just like the man himself, although this game has no ""Shadow"" or ""Darkness"" element. Instead, you have ""Blood"" spells (which there aren't a lot of) and ""Earth"" types (also fairly limited). Being my first character, I was kinda surprised how effective he was, but that brings me to the question of:Difficulty. This is WAY easier than most Souls-likes, and unlike what feels like the majority of that miserable fanbase, I don't think that's a weak point. This is very easy for a newbie or someone who actively doesn't care for the Souls series to get into and love. Compare any game in the Soulsborne series, or even Sekiro, and I think the greatest number of times I had to repeat any boss fight was... five? Six? That's maybe half an hour at most on a single fight, whereas most of its forebears end up being more like three to five hours, if not longer. This is a GOOD THING. Additionally, you get ""souls"" at a WAY faster rate in this game; it's honestly surprising. Instead of leveling up by increasing one stat, you just straight increase your level, which boosts your naked stats across the board. If you're still lacking in a specific area while stuck on a boss, this means you can just swap out your class to get that CLASS'S boosts to that stat. I never had to do this to overcome any particular challenge but overall, this system means more than once I lost upwards of 400,000 Haze and didn't really care. Not only because it's easier to buff your character more quickly, but enemies pour it out so rapidly that it's not hard to stockpile. I ended my first run at level 140, and was even around 70 by the time I hit the 25% mark. You will likely never be at a point where you can't get a new skill or spell; playing a caster, I had to spend way more Haze on abilities than a melee/stealth type will, and I don't think I grinded once.The story is fine. I don't mean that to sound derogatory, but it's fairly usual anime fare. Post-apocalypse, life is hard, people are struggling, and there's fallout from a war that sparked when the world collapsed. Meet friends, beat up bad guys, win. Mind you I think the dialogue and voice acting are VERY good, but the story won't wow you in any way. It's fine.Overall, I recommend this game. That buddy I mentioned above bought it for me, but I wouldn't feel slighted if I spend 60 bucks on it. My only real complaint is restoring vestiges (which you'll do a lot of) should just play out as a cinematic instead of having to actively walk through the movies; that's pretty stupid. But that's a tiny complaint. The NPC design, the combat, the class system, they're all good fun, and I think this is something I'll definitely come back to.8/10.			"
Recommended,14,"																 Ordinary action JRPG with SOULS and GOD EATER feeling  Review with Platinum (100% Achievement)If you are looking for SOULS  gaming style with lower difficulty and GOD EATER  eye-catching graphic design, this game offers several details that will match your desires. It is an action Japanese role-playing game in limited open world. The background has been set in the dark fantasy story and the post-apocalypic era where the rest humans against Revenants. Furthermore, Blood Code system is presented as a flexible class system whereas skill building can be altered by players' styles. It also comes up with collaborative adventures throughout AI partner and co-op multiplayer features that will encourage your battles. Although this game has many amazing details, I would recommend you to buy it on discount only. This is the most money-wasting game for me. Since many parts of the game such as story (cutscenes and storytellers), map explorations, and redundant monsters are so boring. Full price is not worth it. Pros: - Good character customization: after the first character creation, players' still can modify their characters again during normal gameplay.- Various class builds and AI partner's customization: not only your build, but also your AI partner that can be changed.- Many equipments: there are many equipments presenting in this game that will change your tactics.- Beautiful songs: this one is an important part that you will not forget.- Good optimization: it can be run smoothly even in low-end PC that absolutely lower than the minimum specs. Cons: - Duplicate monsters in the maps: there are not many unique mobs represented in this game. Also, same monster will be respawned in the exact spot whenever you re-enter the map.- Too small maps: it can be considered as super limited open world all the way.- Flat and boring story: you will get many cutscenes in this game, but most of them are so boring and you will even skip it immediately.- Level confusion: all maps were designed with frustrated and confused structures. You will forget some locations and loss your way easily. It is not your fault. Everything just looks like the same and pointless.- Speakless main character: although there is a voice selection in character creation, it is just a fake feature. Main character cannot speak or even make some noises.			"
Not Recommended,3.5,"																OVERALL:I haven't played a ton of anime-type games, but this isn't a bad one. I give it at least a solid 8/10 in that category. Definitely a good buy when on sale for ~$20.--I won't spoil anything here other than my own opinion.--GENERAL FEEL:However, being someone who plays FromSoft games, I only give it a 7/10 outside of it being an anime-type game. While the combat and story was enough to motivate me to finish the game, I felt the dialogue and setting was trying too hard to be edgy. I ended up not taking it very seriously most of the game.WORLD LAYOUT:I thought the actual world was interesting at first, but it quickly became repetitive in layout and design. The enemy variety is not expansive (except for the bosses). The color palette reminded me of how Fallout 3 is to the rest of its franchise. There didn't seem to be much thought that went into the layout of areas other than just making a small maze. One of the things I look for in games like this is area layouts based on actual story and world-building that are fun to explore. They got that part half-right. Most of the layouts reuse the same assets heavily to make what looks like a very thrown-together maze of rubble. Not all of it is bad though. Some of the enemy placement ideas for areas were good. The last area of the game seemed to have more work put into it.COMBAT:I haven't delved deep into different builds, but I immediately went for the Zweihander and Berserker Blood Code. I later ended up using Atlas with Zweihander. My veil was the Thorn veil.The combat actually feels really good for the most part. There are a variety of moves your character can use just through basic attack buttons combined with movement. Then you have abilities which use ichor. I definitely saw how all of it contributed to a wide variety of build choice. And that's always fun.STORY & DIALOGUE:I don't like when a story tries too hard to be serious and comes off unnecessarily edgy. This story did that unfortunately. The overall ideas behind the story were good though.MUSIC & TONE:I can't really complain about the music much. There were moments where the music disagreed with the tone set by other factors in the game. And many moments where a cut-scene would be too try-hard edgy, and the music only made it worse. For area exploration and general combat, the music was enjoyable.OBVIOUS INSPIRATIONS:This game clearly takes inspiration from Bloodborne and Dark Souls. I think souls-like games can achieve greatness regardless of this. (Look to games like Ashen.) With that in mind, there are certain unfinished ideas with this game that try to mirror aspects of Bloodborne which annoy me. The main one is the chalice dungeon idea that they went for with the depths. That was something I loved about Bloodborne and explored extensively. Code Vein even used similar names for weapon variants you can find in the optional depths areas. Given the poor level of Area layout and enemy variety, this disappointed me. I like the idea of it, but it needs to be improved.			"
Recommended,7.5,"																EDIT:Okay but now that I think I have played this for long enough to give some depth to my review - I can't stop playing. I sincerely am addicted to both this story-line, music, characters, Character customisation and I've even gained a crippling need to 100% complete this game via finding all the vestiges. I never played God Eater before this, nor watched it, but I knew exactly what I should have been expecting.. and yet it surpassed every single expectation I had, and I'm growing more fond of this game each and every hour I complete it.Dying doesn't feel rage inducing anymore, it feels like a competitive battle, an extreme rush of stubborness. My only petty dislike right now is that, whilst the character customisation is WILD, there is very few selections of actual base clothes - but even then, those clothes you can edit.. remove pieces, add pieces, change their colours to whatever - and they will be covered by Blood Veils somewhat anyway (Armour - you will still see your clothes without armour in the main safe area.) But uH YE, get it lmao------------------------I mean, we all came here for Anime Angst with some edgy vampire backstory - and whilst that exists...It's also some very powerful care-bear level of s**t, MLP: Friendship is Magic kinda stuff... 'tis a good experience			"
Recommended,52.1,"																It's a very close call between positive and negative. I'd rate the game a 5 out of 10. Code Vein is considered a soulslike and has a lot of things that it does right for a game in this genre. Gaining levels with souls (called ""haze""), getting and upgrading weapons, being able to play with a friend, being able to choose between a lot of different playstyles (big 2h sword, small quick sword, magic, etc.) and some more. However the game has a lot of major flaws that are just infuriating at times to the point where It's a close call for me wheter I can recommend this to a soulsfan or not.First of all the level design, it's mediocre at best. None of the areas feel very well tought-out and feel more like a spam of whatever they were trying. There are some very straight-forward linear levels that you just run through without a second thought and there are some areas that are just complicated for complications sake. One area just has a LOT of side paths and places where you can jump down/climb up and it's more about wheter you can remember the one door you missed somewhere in the middle or you'll be running in circles for hours. Then there is the story, it's just a random 12 year old's monster fantasy and is completely forgettable. The characters in it are annoying and dressed ridiculously. If you'd met ANY of the characters in real life you wouldn't be able to take them serious. On top of that there are WAY too many cutscenes that all have a short loading screen before and after them. You can skip them after they started but there is no option to just skipp all cutscenes automatiscly.That last part plays a very big role in NG+ and beyond. I finished the game 4 times on one savefile and I've unlocked all the achievements, but ♥♥♥♥ me was NG+ a pain in the ass. Sometimes you get 3+ cutscenes in a row that all take a loading screen inbetween them and you are just spamming the skip button for a minute straight. On top of that the difficulty ramp from NG to NG+ is ridiculous. The monsters and bosses are still easily killable but basicly everything can 1- or 2-shot you as they just increased the damage a LOT on NG+. Many monster attacks have questionable hitboxes and on top of that little rocks on a corner are sometimes a big invisible wall that forces you to take a wider turn around it. The problem is on NG+ you roll into it and just get 1-shot again. The difficulty on NG is on the easy side. If you played DS 1, 2, 3 BB and sekiro, you will have no issue at all. You might die once or twice on a boss but you can basicly brute force most bosses if you've upgraded yout weapon and have a build that's not too bad.I feel like I'm rambling at this point but SO many small things in this game just made it annoying and frustrating at so many points in the game that it is hard to recommend. It does enough things right to not be  an absolute waste of time but I'd definately recommend buying it on sale if you want to give it a try.			"

Starting a new game will open a screen where you’ll see a bright light with particles falling around. Then you’ll hear a sexy voice saying, “Good Morning”, “Hey... can you hear me?” then “Think back... Search your memory for an image of yourself”. I did think of an image of myself, sadly none of the options were as gorgeous as me so I had to make do with what they had on offer using the Customise Character options. Basic Appearance will allow you to choose from several preset options for your character. There are quite a few more options to customise your character’s appearance, selecting Advanced Settings will allow you to change your Physique, Skin, Hair, Face, Eyes, Eyebrows, Makeup, Scars/Others, Face Paint, Accessories, Clothing, Purifier Mask, and Voice. Once you have your character to your liking you can save the appearance, then you can hit the Confirm button and the game will start.  You will hear that sexy voice again as the screen goes bright, revealing you in a strange place. Here you’ll have a face to put towards the voice; the owner of the voice is called Cruz. She’ll take you through the tutorial and explain how things work within the game. She also tells you that you have been reborn as an immortal creature, a Revenant. All revenants have different powers coursing through their veins, and these special powers are call Blood Codes.  To begin with you only have one Blood Code - the Fighter - although as you go through the tutorial, you’ll acquire a couple more Blood Codes - Ranger and Caster. The Fighter boasts endurance for melee combat and raises abilities on strength and dexterity. The Ranger blood code allows your character to provide support and defense buffs with Gifts. The Caster blood code allows you to use powerful attacks from a distance. You will unlock new Blood Codes as you progress through the game.  Each blood code will have a varying number of Gifts which can be learned, giving your character more powers. These Gifts are skills which can be used to increase your powers, heal, add effects to weapons such as poison, and more. You can acquire new Gifts at Mistle points, where you can rest, gain new gifts, store any items you don’t currently require in the storage. You can also Heal your health and Teleport to previously found Mistle points. However, if you have cleared the area around a Mistle point prior to using it, when exiting the Mistle all the creatures you disposed of previously will reappear.  After completing the tutorial, you’ll find yourself waking up with no memory, and a girl (Io) looking over you who can’t remember anything either. This happens with Revenants; each time they die they lose a bit more of their memory when they are reborn. Io leads you to a spring to quench your thirst, however there is no water at this spring and even if there were water, it wouldn’t quench your thirst, as only blood can do that. The spring is dry, the girl bites your arm and your blood drops down into the ground around the spring. This reinvigorates the spring, making it blossom with Blood Beads. Revenants need blood to hold off the thirst; without blood, their thirst will overcome them, and they’ll turn into mindless Lost. Once a revenant turns in to a Lost there’s no turning back. After the Io gives you one of the blood beads, she takes care of you while you recover. Then a couple of revenants appear and take you both back to their base, which is run by an arrogant revenant who collects other revenants and uses them to search in the dangerous shadows for Blood Beads. You awake to find yourself amongst other revenants being held against their will. You can talk with the other captive revenants and maybe gain some information on what is going off.  This revenant needs to find enough blood beads before Silva comes to collect his levy, therefore he sends other revenants in search of new springs and blood beads. Silva is the revenant who runs everything; they have all the remaining humans and demand a levy of blood beads from the remaining revenants. The springs have all dried up, so the only hope is to find new springs. However, any new springs that may exist are places which are either filled with the Lost or where the miasma is too thick. Therefore, you and the other revenants are collected as slaves. It’s from here that your journey will begin.  After teaming up with another revenant, Oliver Collins, you’re both kicked into a hole which leads into the underground depths. You can’t leave the way you entered, so you head off in the search of Blood Beads and an exit from the underground.   As you make your way through the depths looking for Blood Beads you come across plenty of Lost. Defeating these Losts will sometimes drop items, such as Shards or Weapons. You can also find these scattered around, shining on the floor or somewhere. Picking them up will reveal what you have found. There are also some chests scattered about; usually you’ll find some sort of lost you’ll need to defeat before finding out what is in the chest. While exploring, you’ll find Mistle points; some of these need activating, while others are rotten and will need purifying or defeating the Lost which infected the rotten Mistle. Purifying or activating a Mistle will purify the miasma in the surrounding area and it will reveal the surroundings on your map. You will have another character partner with you as you play through the game, both exploring and in combat. As you progress, you’ll be able to change partners should you need or wish too; you can do this at Mistle points. When in combat you’ll have the use of different weapons, such as Hammers, Axes, Poleaxes, Blades etcetera. Which weapons you use can depend on your current Blood Code. You can have two weapons and switch between them at any time while in combat. If a certain weapon isn’t to your play style or you need some extra oomph, then swapping Blood Codes will allow you to change combat style. You can assign any Gifts learned from Blood Codes to your weapon attacks or to support your partner. As you defeat Lost, you’ll collect Haze, which you can use to level up your character at Mistle points.  Haze can also be used along with other items to upgrade your weapons, gifts and equipment. You can also gain Haze by using shards found from defeating Lost or found scattered around on the floor or in chests. The game is very enjoyable to play; I love the graphics and the story. The game plays well and the combat is pretty good, although I tend to get a bit lost at times as the camera angle changes and I’m trying to get back into a position of being able to continue in combat. This only tends to happen with the bigger Lost creatures and may not be a problem for other players. Overall, I like the game and would certainly recommend it.

Recommended,39.4,"																""Anime Souls""?O que é Code Vein?Code Vein é um Action RPG feito em parceria pela Shift e também pela Bandai Namco, no game você é um vampiro vivendo em um mundo pós-apocalíptico, monstros sinistros atacam os pequenos grupos de sobreviventes e humanos são usados como fonte de alimento pelos vampiros, enquanto ""sanguessugas"" brigam entre si por sangue, uma força poderosa se move nas sombras.Gameplay; Bem, se você já jogou Dark Souls então vai notar muitas semelhanças, tanto na gameplay como no ambiente ao seu redor, Code Vein funciona mais ou menos assim: Existe uma espécie de lobby, é o refúgio do seu personagem, nele você pode aprimorar suas armas, armaduras (Blood Veil), você pode conversar com os seus companheiros, tem quartos, rádio com músicas muito boas (o nome da banda que aparece nos rádios é VAMPS se não me engano, irônia né?) e tem uma sauna para relaxar e nela podemos ter acesso a cutcenes da história do game. É também aí que podemos descer para lugares chamados de ""Depths"" algo assim, esses lugares são como mini cenários onde enfrentamos bosses e vários inimigos para ganhar recompensas, aliás, para podermos ter acesso a elas precisamos encontrar os mapas que estão escondidos nos cenários do game ou são entregues como recompensa por npcs que encontramos durante a jogatina. Uma coisa que achei legal é que tem alguns itens chamados de ""vestígios"" neles podemos reviver as memórias de companheiros ou de amigos deles e assim adquirimos poderes novos, falando nisso, o game tem um sistema de build muito sinistro, ele é chamado de ""Blood Code"", você precisa encontrar esses blood codes, da pra fazer isso de várias formas, os Blood Codes são builds específicas, por assim dizer, são como classes, cada um é específico para algo, seja suporte, tank, ou dano a distância, cada blood code possuí habilidades únicas chamadas de ""Gifts"", é claro, você pode customizar essas habilidades e seus golpes vão ser bem fluídos. Os seus companheiros são indispensáveis, você pode escolher apenas um para te ajudar durante a jogatina, mas acredite, você não tem do que reclamar, alguns são muito fortes, já outros nem tanto, cada um tem uma personalidade diferente, eles possuem suas histórias nas quais você pode brevemente explorar, é legal ver como eles interagem com você, eles te dão dicas de itens durante o game, te falam para prestar atenção com tal coisa, as vezes eles reclamam de algo, etc, achei muito bem feito e até parece realmente ser outra pessoa jogando com você.  O game tem um sistema de troca e recompensa, você coleta objetos escondidos pelo cenário durante a sua jogatina, coisas como: Sushi, bebidas, ursinhos, peças, frascos de sangue etc, e pode presentar seus companheiros com esses itens, cada presente dado vai te dar pontos de troca com o personagem específico, cada personagem tem itens próprios para te dar, sejam armas ou emotes, quando você completa alguma quest de algum companheiro, você recebe presentes deles, achei isso muito legal.  Os cenários são bem feitos, construídos nos moldes do Dark Souls, ou seja, geralmente vamos encontrar inimigos escondidos esperando você passar para te atacar, itens escondidos em caixas, caminhos secretos, atalhos, mini bosses, temos o famoso drop de item baseado em sorte e claro, não podemos esquecer, temos uma ""bonfire"" também (famosa fogueira do Dark Souls usada para ter acesso a áreas diferentes do jogo, aumentar o nível do personagem e outras funções), mas ao estilo Code Vein. A diferença começa quando notamos um mini mapa, acredite, esse mini mapa será salvador porque não podemos ter ideia dos caminhos por onde passamos até que encontremos uma planta que nos da o poder de revelar o cenário e só aí é que podemos ver os caminhos que podemos tomar durante a gameplay, existe um cenário específico o qual eu carinhosamente chamo de ""Anor Londo"", foi o cenário onde passei grande parte do meu tempo jogado, é uma dor de cabeça concluir os objetivos desse lugar. O combate é muito divertido e algumas boss fights são até complicadas, você precisa trabalhar em conjunto com o seu companheiro e caso esteja jogando com um amigo, a coordenação é muito importante, se conseguimos atacar um inimigo sorrateiramente a animação do ataque muda e o dano aumenta pra caramba, é praticamente um backstab ala vampiro. O combate é bem feito na minha opinião, errar um golpe ou tentar uma habilidade em um momento ruim pode levar a uma morte rápida, muitos inimigos podem te finalizar sem problemas caso você perca o foco durante o combate. Não acho que tem muito a se falar nesse aspecto, dois pontos relevantes para se falar do combate: Se você é morto, o seu companheiro pode dar parte da barra de vida dele para te reerguer, mas isso tem um limite, e também, as habilidades, Blood Gifts, são muito boas se usadas de forma inteligente, podem dar muito dano e ajudar em situações difíceis, seja para desviar de ataques, colocar efeito em armas ou causar um dano devastador, o combate de Code Vein é bem divertido e difícil até certo ponto. A criação de personagens é algo incrível, você pode fazer o seu personagem de diversas formas diferentes, se é fã de animes então a criação de personagens vai ser um paraíso, da pra fazer seu personagem como quiser, já vi altos ""Kanekis e Aquas"" por aí. É algo que se destaca nesse game.Pontos positivos:* Criação de personagem muito bem feita.* As cutscenes são legais de serem assistidas* O game é mais longo do que eu esperava e é algo que gosto em jogos.* O game é bem interativo, se você deixa seu personagem sentado e fica AFK por muito tempo, ele acaba ficando entediado e acaba dormindo.* Eu amei a trilha sonora, mas isso é meio que pessoal então esse ponto é relativo.* O game tem um New Game Plus* O Coop é muito bem feito e não tive qualquer problema.Pontos negativos:* Tem alguns bugs, aliás, qual jogo não tem, não é mesmo?* Não tive quedas de frames, porém, o jogo acaba congelando por 1 segundo as vezes, não é constante, acontece uma vez ou outra, conversei com alguns amigos que jogam e aparentemente não sou o único.*  Você pode se perder facilmente enquanto joga mesmo tendo o mini mapa revelado durante a jogatina, acho que o design do mini mapa em si poderia ser feito de forma diferente, bem, de qualquer jeito não é algo que vá estragar o jogo. Vale a pena? Se você gosta de animes e jogos difíceis, ou é fã do gênero ""souls-like"" então Code Vein vai ser o seu game, a criação de personagem, o desafio das boss fights ou chegar inteiro até elas, são algumas das coisas que fazem de Code Vein um jogo excelente para jogar sozinho ou com um amigo. Recomendo o jogo, mas, é claro, leve em consideração o fato do jogo não ser para todo mundo. Se encontrar algum erro ortográfico relaxe camponês, acontece.

Recommended,21.5,"																Really good side game to the GE series, the main issue is, no ultrawide support, yet it supports 144+ fps so theres a step in somewhat the right direction there. Game play is fun and challanging. But the main issue I have is the shockingly bad multiplayer, out of all the things to copy from darksouls, who went to the meeting and voted to port the monstrocity that is this multiplayer, its just annoying to play with friends when you get disconnected every 5 mins, sure the ability to join randos is really fun, but I want to play with friends like in GE and then say chill with them back at the home base after a long grind which you cant do either.

Recommended,38.8,"																Dark souls inspired anime rpg that's not really hard.+ the graphic is anime style. which i like.+ unlike dark souls the story is more direct in its approach. and the story itself is your anime-type story that focuses on teenage vampires trying to save the world. for me it's quite good and it's has some good moments, althou sometime it still retain that cringey anime tropes (atleast to me).+ the characters in this story is great with great voice acting (japan dub), they have quite the personality and integral to the plot. also IO IS THE BEST GIRL :)+ the gameplay is really similar to souls from leveling system, boss fights to level design etc. but a whole lot easier especially with the companion that help in combat.+ the game has variety of classes with it's own skillset.+ the combat is your typical soulslike dodge, defend, hit, and repeat.+ character creator with a lot of customization.- i dont really like the silent MC thing, it's kinda ruin a cutscene when they just stood silent staring at an npc.

Recommended,30.7,"																Surprisingly good and charming. The english voice actors do not mix well with the character's reactions so it kind of makes things awkward most of the time. If you want full immersion it's best to put it in Japanese voice over than english, which is an option. Another strange annoyance is the scaling, it scales just fine unless people have put together really powerful abilities along with insane recovery in their drain (basically mana or action points) back along with great swords that can infinite stun and do large amounts of damage. It's fine if you just want to play this casually or you want to challenge yourself with a partner but when the partner pretty much wrecks face it kind of kills the challenge entirely. Other than those complaints, the game is pretty darn good. The graphics are good, the customization is insanely well put together, and the combat is simple but the difficulty of the game turns simple mechanics to stress induced fighting mechanics due to the enemies and their insane difficulty spikes. Hell, YOU CAN PUT A BACKPACK ON YOUR FACE! HOW CAN YOU EVEN SEE?! Thumbs up all the way.			"

Recommended,20.4,"																Wonderful story telling. Combat is fun and addictive. Map and play spaces are absolutely stunning. one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, Don't even get my started on the character creation(A++++).A couple downsides I have; Locking in the game can be annoying. When locked onto a target if you just barely hit a key a bit to much (Attack as example) you are stuck in a loop of doing just that, which you cannot move at all until the attacks are over, whats worse is you cannot aim these attacks, whichever direction you were facing is where you are going. Same for dodging except its a bit different, just dodging once can screw you up while locked and put you in a cycle of countless dodges into the same spot on a wall.Movement while locked can be limited and buggy; But without the lock feature then skills are next to useless.Doesn't have enough side quests/side quests arent anything special; It feels boring to have explored this amazing play space only to have it next to useless the rest of the game outside of the occasional map of the depths or boring side quest which pops up. Adding more side quests, types of side quests, and more uses for these vast areas created is a huge step forward into making this game easily one of the best games of our time.			"
Recommended,54.9,"																Overall, this is a very serviceable and pretty fun dark souls-alike (until we actually coin a good name for this particular breed of game, like the coining of 'metroidvania').I think whether or not this game will appeal does actually boil down to how appealing the character creator looks to you: it's what attracted me to the game, and it's the most robust part of the game being able to make your own anime fashion disaster. If that appeals to you, go for it. If you think character expression and ownership is an important aspect of the game, this one has it in spades.The other thing that might put people off is the interminable and long and extremely melodramatic anime cut scenes. There's a lot of narm-charm to be had with this game's ridiculous story, but it does toe a thin line being endearingly amusing and cringyawful.Except for one element:If the multiplayer feels very tacked on at the end and shoddily implemented, that's because all signs point towards that being the case: the multiplayer has a lot of room for improvement. It's fine when it works, but it took a lot of wrangling to be able to play with the friends, and I found it even harder to get matched up with random players.			"

Tho i do have some issues with certain part of the story, the memory vestiges are soo boring and whats worse the ""tragic"" stories portrayed there are actually same story repeated over and over again with different characters, it goes like this:1. Character A feeling guilty about their past helps B2. B feels gratitude and mistakes guilt for genuine compassion3. B feels guilty about being helped for no reason and sacrifices their life to help someone else4. Now A is even more guilty and it's supposed to be tragic, but after seeing it 1000 times with Louis/Kevin, Karen/Aurora, Carmilla/Mia, Silva/Cruz, Jack/Eva, Mia/Nicola, and so on and so forth it becomes really annoying and you just roll your eyes and think ""oh boy here we go again, who's gonna sacrifice themselves this time?""The main plot line is much better in comparison.The level design could be better, sometimes it's straightfoward, sometimes not, sometimes its a maze hell like the Cathedral. Enemies are ok, I really enjoyed exploring the levels and clearing the mobs. Boss fights could be better, usually takes me about 3 attempts to beat a  boss, sometimes 10, sometimes I won by the first try.....Needless to say the game is easier than Dark Souls, but not so easy to be boring. You can always dismiss your companion for artifical difficulty. Various builds are really fun and diverse, in the beginning I thought 2H weapons are op but soon i changed my mind, nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥ about here, there are over 150 gifts(skills) you can learn, master and transfer between 30 blood codes(classes) which allows for really a lot of diversification and funWeapon upgrade system is quite simplistic, personally I enjoy more complex systems like in god eater but whatever. 9/10 really great game I don't regret buying it at full price. And that character creator! So many possibilities!			"

Not Recommended,12.5,"																Having completed the game and experienced all the content Code Vein has to offer, I say that I can recommend it, but for those that are sure they are interested. For those uncertain, Code Vein is bound to be a mixed bag. At its core, Code Vein can be summarized as an Anime Dark Souls, with a greater degree of Anime than Dark Souls. Code Vein is also arguably an easier game to progress through than the Dark Souls line of games.There is a very large degree of customization in the game. Not only is the character customization very extensive, the number of weapons, equipment, Blood Codes (essentially classes that you can swap), and Gifts (essentially skills like buffs, magic, or attacks) are considerably many in number as well which allows for further customization of play style. The bosses are also varying in design, in both appearance and behavior. Each boss possesses elements that pose a challenge to players depending on their play style and build. In addition, the behavior of the boss tends to change as each fight progresses, generally involving a 2 phase or even 3 phase boss fight. While the selection of regular mobs is less varying, there is still an ample amount of variation that it doesn't feel like x mob is just y mob but with a different color scheme. The varying locations are also very pleasant to look at, with differing environmental elements to differentiate them.Unfortunately, Code Vein also has faults to it. Those expecting multiplayer co-op or PvP will be quite disappointed. The multiplayer co-op function is somewhat broken, and PvP invasions don't exist at all. The multiplayer co-op function that does exist was the main reason for Code Vein's 1 year delay, as it wasn't originally planned to be in the game. The co-op mechanic feels like an afterthought for the way it is implemented. While it shows region selection/restriction in game as an option, it restricts you to co-op with people in the same Steam download region (there does exist a workaround, but that is extra trouble and effort to deal with). In addition, actual co-op is limited to specific zones. You are unable to call in help if you have already defeated the boss of a location. You are unable to group up with a friend in the home hub area. You are unable to join a friend in the depths maps if you yourself are not in the depths. Also, upon defeat of the boss of an area, you immediately leave the host's world. This departure is so fast that there is not even time for the usual farewell gesture before you are booted back to your own world. The locations, while pleasant to look at, can become quite grating. There is one particular area in the game where its entire purpose is to act like a maze. Full exploration of that one area becomes a slog as the paths begin to blend together and look the same. A large number of locations are also mere variations of a ruined city. While the differing environmental elements do help to alleviate the sensation that there is a lack of location diversity, too many of the location boil down to ""ruined city with this one thing to make it different"". The bosses also possess a vast different in difficulty. There are a few bosses where the difficulty suddenly spikes, and bosses directly preceding and following them are easy or even trivial. Although overcoming these difficulty spikes is a rewarding process, these difficulty spikes are still jarring and make the pacing of the game awkward. The story is also filled with cliches and tropes. This is to be expected for anything of the anime genre. While I personally enjoyed the story as a whole, I can see that the cliches and tropes contained in the story may be an undesirable element and turn people away from Code Vein.Keeping the pros and cons in mind, I can recommend Code Vein as a single player anime soulslike.

Recommended,39.1,"																I wish there was a ""Meh"" category... TLDR: God Eater had a love-child with a souls-like-Final Fantasy game; I'd grab it on saleDon't get me wrong; it's a ""good game"" and you can definitely have some fun in it.That said:Things I wish were different, and would improve my experience thus far:- Fewer forced lore scenes (Memory/Vestege)- Enemy variety (they change a ""little"", but overall pretty similar in style)- Tougher bosses (I realize you can turn the AI off, but thats also part of the experience; I don't want just a boss with more HP...)On the note of boss fights; I'd also like to note that they really don't feel very satisfying. They all just spam attack and fly around the fighting area...no real sense of uniqueness (though they are physically different)- I'd also like to touch on map design - The levels are, at times, pretty maze-like...but it also feels like it's just overly complex for the sake of being complex...no real rhyme or reason for it.If there is one thing this game did right, it's the character creation process; other games: You've been put on notice! I spent an hour...and that felt rushed. There is so much build variety potential here; another thing done really well; it just doesn't feel like it matters much in the later game stages. Overall it's a ""fun"" experience...but it's obvious which action RPG games Bandi collaborated with From Software with, and which ones they didn't... The combat is what you'd expect, but nothing ground shattering. (Referencing how much work it took to break the Dark Souls muscle memory to play Sekiro, for instance)			"
Recommended,40.2,"																When I first learned about this game, I was ready to throw my money at it because I like Dark Souls, (non-sparkling) vampires, and post-apocalyptic settings, but after I saw the clothes (or insufficiency thereof) of the female characters, I clicked ""ignore.""  Fast forward to the 2022 winter sale, I was looking for games to buy and I saw that this was 85% off.  I figured that there will probably be mods to fix some annoyances so decided to give this a try.Positives:-Combat doesn't feel as good as Dark Souls but it's still fun.-NPC partners are decent in combat when exploring. You don't have to babysit them.  You can also go solo if you want. I played this 100% offline so I can't comment on co-op.-Photo mode is pretty good. The camera's travel distance is limited, but it could be extended by using a mod.-Skippable cutscenes and memory sequences. My second and third playthroughs were so much better than the first after skipping almost all of those.-I used a PS4 controller and the game shows PS4 buttons without having to install a mod. I just had to uncheck ""PlayStation Configuration Support"" and check ""Generic Gamepad Configuration Support"" in Steam's settings to make the controller work correctly.-All achievements can be unlocked with the base game only. You don't have to buy the DLC to get 100%.Neutral:-There are no fixed classes. Leveling just increases HP, stamina, and attack power. Your other stats depend on your blood code (class) and your gear. You can swap blood codes anytime.-As for difficulty, I thought it's generally easier than the Souls games.  Regular enemies are easy to backstab.  Some late game bosses took me some time to beat but I think I was underleveled. Even then, the hardest bosses here are still easier compared to the hardest Souls bosses.-Story and characters are meh and dialogue is kinda cheesy.Negatives:-Fanservice. I know that many consider it positive, but it's a huge turn off for me, especially when it's excessive.  Almost all female characters, including the protagonist, NPCs, enemies, and bosses, are dressed either in skimpy/revealing clothing or something that doesn't look practical in combat. If you don't skip cutscenes, unnecessary fanservice will pretty much be shoved in your face every time a female character appears in them. I would have been less annoyed if the male characters are also similarly dressed in skimpy/revealing outfits. I still won't like the outfits, but at least the designs would be consistent. Thankfully, there are mods that allow the female protagonist and a couple of female NPCs to have more decent outfits.-Silent protagonist worked in the Souls games/Elden Ring.  Here, it just makes the cutscenes with dialogue look very awkward. The other characters talk to your character but he/she responds only with gestures, nods, etc.  It wouldn't have been that bad if you only see your chacter's back, but the camera focuses on your character's face and he/she doesn't say anything.  But after hearing my character speak 2 lines near the very end of the game, I'm not sure if I want to hear more voiced lines.-There is an extremely grindy RNG-based achievement.  It took me around 8 hours repeatedly killing one enemy to get those 400 Marks of Honor required for the achievement.  Not sure if it's faster in co-op, but I read that it's still extremely grindy.-Gift (ability) mastery can also be very grindy, whether you're repeatedly killing enemies to master gifts or you're farming items for automatic mastery. The good news is that you don't have to master all gifts, just the ones you need.tl;dr - Not as good as the FromSoft games, but the gameplay is fun enough. The experience would have been better if it didn't shove fanservice in your face, and without the extreme grind for one achievement.			"
Recommended,41.9,"																This game is Passable if you want to create a cute waifu and play a generic dark souls like.  It doesnt stand out in any way and is below average in many ways.The story fell completly flat as did all the characters there is many moments where if u cared about the characters at all you might be interested, but you'll find that you dont and getting thru cutscenes is very boring and hard to do.The power system is somewhat interesting however, the weapons/movesets are very boring and I mostly just used the very first sword you get for the entire game, they all feel basically the same in their weapon class and theres only like 6 classes of weapon all with very small movesets.The level design is boring to the extreme it feels like a very dated game. The music has a few standout songs that are pretty awesome imo but 90% of the time you get this generic background ""action"" music or like ambient creepy level explore music barely anything good here.The game can be fairly difficult playing solo which is my preferred method for this game as the NPC's you can have help you make the game a bit too easy for my taste.I do not recommend buying this game or playing it the only really good thing being you can create a very cute waifu with a good character editor.Yet another anime-looking game that is all style and no substance.

Recommended,151,"																It's Souls with a cool anime aesthetic and a skill system that is completely modular. Just swap out some equips and you're a caster now. Sounds great, right?Nope. The level design is awful, each zone feels like a rote path down a linear hall with two branching paths and you have to guess which one dead ends in loot and which one continues the level. The encounters never get interesting. Just another pack of sword wielding zombies rushing you. The same 8 foot tall knight and his friend is back... again, for the twelfth time. A roll swamp? Check. Got an Anor Lando ripoff that is an incomprehensible mess of identical halls trying to feel like the Zork maze? Check.And you'd think the guys who made God Eater twice before this could manage a boss that didn't have dirty, poorly telegraphed, one hit kill BS but nope.Nothing wrong with the story but there is a lot of it and a lot of it told in cool slow walk segments. But Souls thrives on not telling a story beyond mindless nonsense and just letting you play. You ignore a lot of crap in Souls because you can just keep playing so easily. If you have worse pacing than Souls, you have to outdo Souls on the fundamentals. Code Vein doesn't. So all you have is a beautiful but totally middling Souls clone.			"

Recommended,55.8,"																Cinematic effects look awesome, music is was touching, and movement feels smooth. Story pacing was great. Combat is very tactical and adrenaline fueling. It's a pretty good package and is fun with what's there, but ultimately falls flat most of what it sets out to do. I recommend this at a sale for no more than $20. While I do have quite a large amount of negatives to list, these take quite a while to show up. Meaning you'll mostly likely have had your fun and gotten your money's worth before actually being bothered by them. Overall I rate this a solid 8 / 10 ( + Positive ) The character creator is amazing, I spent almost an entire hour in the character creator with the massive amount details to choose from. Pair that with high quality visuals and lots of accessories you can customize, ( Including awesome neon glowing stuff. ) let you really create whatever you want. Rather disappointed on the extreme lack of costumes though.( + Positive ) Combat feels like a dance. You can get into a rhythm of attack, dodge, defend and it feels very satisfying. Various skills and buffs supplement different play styles, but don't expect too much. It's very gated with the Icor system that acts like mana. Icor to use skills can only be gained through items, resting, or attacking an enemy. The max values are very low and require you to hit an enemy with a special move to increase the max. Resting or dieing resets the max to the amount determined by your blood code / class.( + Positive ) Characters are interesting to learn about, well voiced and distinct. Out of the main cast you are not allowed to travel and fight with 3 of them, which I wish you had been able to for the sake of more variety and interaction. The little mini game of giving gifts for items and affection is nice when it doesn't bug out. The main base with it's juke box and furniture to pose on are also great to blow some time in between fighting. You can even visit a hot spring where characters from the story will randomly show up too.( Positive ) Haze which acts as currency for items and leveling is lost on death and can be recovered if you make it back to where you died. This offers very high risk engagements when fighting new and unpredictable enemies which can be thrilling. And equally punishing for underestimating. ( - Negative ) Majority of the content in Code Vein acts as filler. Most weapons and armor are direct upgrades over one another, with a handful of unique boss weapons being viable for niche play styles. The game shows severe favoritism to 2 hand weapons, going as far as opening up 1 shot boss builds. There is almost no reason to ever use any of the early game classes after you've maxed out their skills and transferred them to a better class with your main character's abilities to mix them, due to their inferior stats. Lots of skills are too slow and lack luster in damage for their cost, farther steering you away from using them in moment to moment reaction based game.( - Negative ) Map design feels all over the place and rather inconsistent in quality. Everything is decent. I give props for different environments with interesting scenery, but lots of old time dungeon styled lay outs and minimal stuff in the environment to interact with takes away the appeal. Outside of boss fights it can feel like playing a portable dungeon crawler game at times.( - Negative ) Coop was a selling point, and showed off heavily during beta and marketing. In the full release it's horribly implemented, locking the players in a single region, disallowing them to party again in an area where the boss has been killed, and finally kicking the coop player after either one dies or the boss has been killed. You aren't even allowed to use the rest points or save the game when in coop. ( - Negative ) Season pass was absolute garbage and consisted mostly of reused assets and bosses from another game.			"

Recommended,213.1,"																So my first review so please be gentle lol. To start off should you get Code Vein...In my honest opinion it depends on who you are. As much as I want to say Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Buy it now empty your wallet for the sake of Mia (I guess Io for the Church of Io fanatics) not everyone will enjoy it. There is one simple fact that people may not like it. It's a souls like granted it's more of a casual game there are some moments where people who don't like Souls games will want to smash their head into a wall or through something at the TV but for people who LOVE games like that they'd enjoy it. Although it's not as hard as Dark souls I'll have to admit. (on your first playthrough to be specific as when you beat the game the first time you can then increase the difficulty to extreme which the difficulty scales to your lvl.)  Now for the characters: oh boy I love everyone I like how you can view each of their backstories via Vestiges you can collect throughout the world and get their opinions on what happened in their past or for other characters they had a encounter with. so you'll have someone from the main or side cast talk about that specific person that owned that specific code and Vestiges. and ending this bit with talking about Vestiges that leads me to my next part.The code and weapon mechanics: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love the gameplay especially the code system. it offers up so many different playstyles to choose from with a Inherit system where you can mix and match different abilities from plenty of codes. although there are a few that are limited to a specific code. (cause I can imagine the bullshittery that could happen if you had access to everything) some codes work well with specific types of weapons say if you wanted to go a caster style of playing a Bayonet would be your ideal choice, if you just want to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of people you can go for a code with high strength and use a big ♥♥♥♥ off sword or if you wanted to slap someone with a sword or a Halberd over and over again you could go for a dex build and just combo for days till the enemy is dead. The Ai and partner mechanic: .....This is where I need to bring up a negative about the game granted in general the AI is okay but sometimes the AI just doesn't want to work. I don't believe everyone will have this issue this may be just a nitpick or it might be more common then I think but my biggest gripe is when you're knocked down and you have a few seconds to be revived they'll just roll for the entire time even if there are no enemies granted it was my fault for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up those times however I think a bit of a tweak and everything will be fine. Now for the whole partnership mechanic.. If you have no friends or just want to do singleplayer you can bring an ally with you on your little adventure granted you don't have to but I think the game has been made with the sole intention that you have either a mate or a AI partner with you through the course of the game. with that it'll depend on whether you like it or not I don't really have much of an opinion on it tbh.the story and Multiple endings: now I'll try to refrain from spoiling anything so don't be too concerned about spoilers. The story is pretty good I'll admit I was hooked in which also had a decent payoff for 2 of the Endings the Bad and the True endings. The Neutral ending was meh compared to the others but it was decent.The Multiplayer: I'll need to say something here but I believe you'e better off getting someone else's opinion on this. I could not get the Multiplayer to work when I wasn't playing with a mate of mine for one simple fact I live in Australia. it was hard to find someone and even then when I did I couldn't find anyone, could not connect or got kicked. I believe due to some kind of timeout which is a shame as I'd like to do the Multiplayer more often but it's too much of an issue for me.And I left this one to last where you'll most likely spend half of your game time. the amazing Character creation system....♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they did not spare any expense and have been adding more things to it. granted most of it was festive but who knows how much more they'll add at the time I make this Review. I don't know how to explain this over then the fact it's as great as character creators can be. It's up there with the soul caliber character creation for the best creation system.Overall in my opinion as I've probably already made it clear I recommend this game to anyone who is interested. it's pretty much Dark souls for weebs but for good reason as well as being a damn good game and I hope when I can get a working Multiplayer that I can play with others more often. Also give me that damn accessory set that's in the Deluxe edition I wanna buy it.			"

First time knowing that your butt can be grown on either the left side or the right side of your body, guess they are the Lost for a reason. Some maps can be very irritating.Difficulty is normally built up with piling monsters and their weird attack registration which makes stupid things more easy to happen.Boss love to run around like a mad 3 years old kid.ConclusionGame is decent at least I enjoy it, despite the fact that this game isn't perfect but it still gave me a good time, overall this game is acceptable if you treat it like a semi-casual Japanese RPG game. However if you prefer Dark soul like or super hardcore game, then this is game is not for you.My random thoughtstbh don't compare every single game like this with dark soul, try to live a life and enjoy individual things rather than being a narrow minded try hard. if you love compare all these games to dark soul, why don't you compare your whole family with God? You have the liberty of not buying this game and spending it on something else. Plus there is also steam refund, therefore if you don't like this game, the option is simply and you can walk away rather than screaming like a 3 years old here.Last but not least, thanks for reading everything above. I appreciate if you like or agree with my review. However if you have different opinion or disagreement, feel free to leave a comment to share with me. After all I wish you guys have a nice day and hope this review helps.			"
Recommended,82.4,"																My review of this game is overall positive.Graphics - Pretty Damned Great, if you're into the anime style graphics,Music - Edgy (I muted the music, as I do with all other games)Story - It's like Owari no Seraph meets God Eater.Gameplay - Frustrating but funMy personal more indepth analysis is more nitpicking the finer details.There's no order to these so:1. Multiplayer matches end very abruptly when you clear the boss, there's no time at all to celebrate or wave goodbyes. The game literally kicks out the helping player immediately. Would be nice to have like a 15-30 second window to emote or something.2. There's no voice acting for your character in any of the cut-scenes, which is cool but you choose a voice in character creation and the only time you hear your character speak in the chosen voice is emotes. So see above comment. (would like more dialogue with the main character both in and out of multiplayer honestly. The silent protagonist is cute at first but later makes no sense.)3. The character creation is great, you have so much control over how you create yourself. Things I find missing trivial but notable, such as only ONE scar slot in the final game, with no option to tweak position, rotation, size or anything like that. There are like 500ish eyebrows but only like 30 hairstyles and 1/20th that for outfits (which are modular so thats cool) but there are no body sliders, body shapes, no height sliders or anything like that but the NPC characters in the game have such a diverse body variety that I feel jipped there. Hopefully with patches there is more customization options available, and maybe clothing packs or something as DLC.4. The game is best played on controller, imo.5. Combat can be trivial but unpredictable and it's hard to tell if enemies scale with level. The game feels just as difficult at level 50+ than it did at level 15-20. Now when the game punishes you is when you get caught with an attack and there's like 2-4+ IMMEDIATE follow up attacks that your character is stun locked in, so in literally 1-2 seconds you can go from full health to kicking the bucket and it wouldn't have been your mistake. Just the game enemies AI decides whether it wants to be chill or make it a living hell for you. 5.a. Enemies feel challenging on their own, but god help you if you get caught in a swarm of them.6. For a game that takes inspiration from the Dark Souls series, why did Bandai Namco have to take inspiration from some of the most dumb aspects like the Multiplayer matchmaking.7. Some of the levels have no visual diversity. Like Cathedral, it was a huge wow factor. It was amazing to see, such a pristine looking structure/area in a setting like the rest of game but then 15 minutes later you'll hate your life because everything looks the same and it's just a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maze that has you running around for a couple hours looking at the same rooms and bridges. What the game does really well for me is the story telling, I think all of the cut scenes together make up like a little 3 hours of content. It's very much like being an anime that two seasons of episodes are crammed into one game here, one blood bead at a time. Be warned some cut scenes are veeeeery long and not all are super exciting. Additionally, while the combat can be frustrating it never felt impossible. The moves are super flashy and exciting, just not a lot of moves. Like a combo is just a repeat of the same animation. That's shared with all of the weapons of that same time with a few variations.I'd recommend this game right now, 60 dollars is getting you a tooooon of content here and a challenging game. If you can look past a few of the quirks here and there its a fantastic game. It's not perfect, but no game truly is			"
Recommended,"2,244.70","																A very solid anime game.- Very good character creation with lots of options.- Fun solid combat: somewhat methodical, low weapon variety, but lots of skills to choose from.- Good story, especially for an anime game (which most of the time appear to be quite bad in my opinion).- Lots of things to do for completionists, but nothing that will take eternities. Mostly searching things in the areas. If you are great at exploring, you can probably find everything in one go.- The characters have varying backstories you will see throughout the game so no one important is just a blank sheet. Their background can also be quite interesting. - Difficulty at the beginning is quite easy and spikes somewhat around the halfway point. Later bosses are definitely (with few exceptions) more challenging.For a harder challenge, going solo without npc help is an option.- Fitting environments, while most levels are quite linear, one level in particular was a joy to traverse with lots of shortcuts, drop downs etc.- The music is most of the time nothing special, but some tracks during bossfights are pretty great.- No problems with the performance, no crashes etc.			"
Recommended,69.4,"																Souls-like gameplay with a God Eater approach to setting and tone about anime vampires. The game brings it's own quirks as well as shortcomings to an often imitated formula. I'm enjoying it very much up to now.Pros:+ Good english voice acting+ Music by Go Shiina, always a pleasure+ Interesting class and ability system which lets you mix together a lot of setups+ Stable PC port (same as GE3)+ Character customization is well doneCons:- I have the feeling that they played it a little too close and safe to the classic Souls-formula in their gameplay and design approach. Maybe get a little wilder next time?- NPC partners: I enjoy taking them along with me. They're a likeable bunch, are given personality and development in the cutscenes, comment on your progress etc. - BUT they make the game too easy (about 6-7 hours in). As of now either you don't use them to increase the challenge and miss out on a nice feature of this game, or take them along with you and have a rather laid back experience difficulty wise.			"
Recommended,70.8,"																Code Vein is very very good!Combat is exceptionally enjoyable, the story is interesting, and the characters are all likable. The majority of the bosses are really enjoyable to fight and are well-designed. And the customization of abilities and weapons is neat. There's a ton of different abilities you can acquire which allow for different types of fighting styles.The game is fairly challenging but overall much easier than the Souls games. Granted, the game would be a LOT more difficult if you couldn't have a companion with you at all times. But there's no reason to not have a companion with you. I feel like it'd be nice if there was some sort of reward/incentive for beating bosses solo.The only real negative that I have with Code Vein is the level design of some areas. Mainly one area in particular... (the cathedral). But for the most part the areas are diverse and fun to explore.I've been looking forward to this game coming out for the past year, and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. Slay some Lost.			"

Game is great, enjoyed it far more than spamming R1 on dark souls. The huge variety of abilities and being able to cross class them is just fantastic. The clothing options is a bit lacking, need that fashion souls going. I really do adore everything about this game though, combat is tight and fun. The game is easy with partners sure, but now going into NG+ Enhanced Mode with no partner, wew it's a new ball game. Do yourself a favor and pick this up.			"
Recommended,106.4,"																Fantastic PC port.  4K max settings, solid 60+ FPS.  Not particularly very hard compared to Souls or Surge.  You can get away with button mashing.  Its way more flashy and fast pace.  Having AI partner does make the game easier but also annoying with the constant same line delivered. Bosses are pretty push over.  A lot of story so don't expect story to be vague and can cut up the pacing of the game.  Overwhelming character customization. Don't go into the game expecting the same feel as soul.  Still a fun game but I was expecting Soul and The surge feel but it still fun for what it is.  			"
Recommended,57.9,"																Everyone that ever doubted me when I said God Eater and Dark Souls could go well together owes me an apology, because this game is literally it.It is important to note that this game focuses more on the world exploration element of Dark Souls than the boss battles, we have huge zones that interconnect through shortcuts and elevators that you have to find by exploring the labyrinth-like structures with a ""map"" that will only show you were you have been, this is a clever way to help you navigate a bit without really giving away the whole area, and in some areas it wont be preventing you from getting lost if you do not abuse an in-game item that acts like a map marker, eventually through the use of the game's ""bonefires"" you get access to the actual map after you have done your amount of exploration, which is the perfect reward for all that effort, as completing the items of some areas would be hell without a map.Of course there are boss battles, but they are not as satisfactory, in my opinion this is because they implemented weapon types that are more of God Eater, without implementing the aggressive fast-paced combat that said game had for them, this in my opinion is the biggest flaw the game has.Regardless of that minor detail this game is a lot of fun, and looks gorgeous as hell, for anime standards, it has that addictive ""one more checkpoint before I sleep"" aspect to it that always ends in lack of sleep.If you enjoy any of the elements I just mentioned, get it, otherwise it may not be your cup of tea.			"
Recommended,93.2,"																Pros:- Players aren't locked to a single style of play- Story is solid. Not amazing, but it's certainly kept me invested (mileage may vary)- Combat is not an unnecessarily complex monster- Character creation is very interesting and one of the better ones out thereCons: - Enemies are pretty samey, you have the same mooks everywhere with maybe one unique themed enemy for the zone- Weapon balance could be better (Hammers and Halberds feel like they are less effective for what they are)Overall thoughts:If you're looking for a souls game, this is a decent enough entry within that vein. The combat is reminiscent of Demons Souls/Dark Souls 1, but with its own unique twist on spells and abilities. The story at a glance seems to be typical anime BS, but what it tells is done in a unique way with character memories and events combining to give the bigger picture, rather than telling you on the nose what is happening. If you see this on sale, I 100% recommend picking it up if you're interested. I am not certain if I can recommend it at full price, however.			"

Recommended,61.4,"																=Jan 2020=Characters are rich but can seem shallow if game is rushed. 100% vestige on first play through is recommended. The vestiges gives a lot of background and lore to the characters and the world. With more information from exploration, vestige and paying attention to the npc dialogues, the endings are very satisfying and complete (aside from secret true end, that's a cliff hanger). Combat is fluid and mage builds are strong enough to be usable even in NG+ (thank you code vein). Being able to change play style on the fly makes the game really enjoyable and greatly reduces the problem of repetitive combat that some games may have. NPC companions have different strength and skills that can support different build and can provide tips during game play through natural dialogues (JP voice only, EN voice is a yikes for many chars).Not all blood codes (classes&abilities) in 1 play through so NG+ is required, but you can keep the difficulty the same. If you already know what triggers the different endings then I recommend: [True End] -> [Bad End] -> [Neutral End], this way you can get all blood codes before the second run is complete. Io still best girl.=Dec 2019=Reminds me of Nier Automata a lot, in terms of story and game experience (not so much combat). JP voice acting is solid. 10/10 would recommend. Io best girl.			"
Recommended,111.7,"																As a soild anime souls-like, Code Vein has proven itself as one of my favorite games. It trades some of the precision something like Dark Souls has for visual flair and other over-exaggerated anime elements, such as having a partner or entire cutscenes for parries which I'm all for. The character creator is amazing, most of the bosses are really fun, and there's plenty of weapons and abilities to play with. The story itself is perfectly fine, but I think most of the interesting world-building comes from flashbacks or the other character's memories. I'd highly recommend picking Code Vein up, and definitely give the demo a try! I spent a good 5 hours in just the demo building characters and trying all the fancy parry/back attack/launch attack animations.			"

Recommended,36,"																It's like anime but it's Dark Soulsbut actually it's Bloodbornebut actually it's big tiddy cybergoth waifu simulatorAs you might expect it borrows a lot of concepts from Dark Souls but has enough fresh ones to make the game stand out : - Melee combat is relatively similar, with an added special move, but you can only equip 2 weapons and there's no main hand/offhand. - Most of the building comes from classes and active/passive skills instead of leveling up.- The rest comes from armor, which comes in one piece but is still very fashionable.- Character creation is insanely good, lots of creative freedom, but not enough to screw it up. - Exploration and level design is very similar, with bonfires, cheeky enemy placement, ladders, levers, and doors that don't open from this side. - You can have a companion that helps you during exploration- Multiplayer is only coop, with only one summon, but it's much easier to find someone. - Depths, which are ressource farming dungeons akin to Bloodborne's chalices. - Gestures are similar, but there are also a lot of sentences that you can bind to shortcuts and your character will actually say them, which is pretty neat. Unlike Dark Souls the game is much more story driven, with high emphasis on cutscenes, dialogue and tragic character backstories. And also friendship because anime. The game looks good, characters are well made and so are the animations. It's well optimized and I only met one very minor bug. The soundtrack is ok, not bad but it doesn't really stand out. it's the typical Dark Souls dramatic orchestra for bosses, with a few more creative tracks here and here. The Japanese voice acting is good, idk about the english dub but I don't think anyone will pick it. The only real cons I could find to this game would be :- The rather boring environments, most of them are modern cities in ruin with a different weather added to them. - The lack of enemy variety, though they at least tried to make re-skins. So In short, if you're into Anime and or Souls-like games, give this a try.			"

This is a must buy in my book, not sure bout you, but you sure as hell missing alot if you don't have this game in your steam library. I don't want to spoil anything but is the story good? oh hell yes, I mean it literally anime.Character customization? If you played jump force, the customization here is equally as good or betterThe combat system here is smooth and fast, hack and slash, I wouldn't say this is similar to souls because soul is alot slower and all about timing and parries.Combat here is more similar to tenchu/sekiro or nioh.The dash.. ayes..I love theorycrafting and they give that to me, You get to have 4 unique passives and 8 active abilities at the same time. The puzzling mapping here is awesome, you need to memorize pattern in some of these maps to figure out where you can open the next door. I'm 13 hours in and I still haven't finished the game,  for me this game is a 10 out of 10, not 9.5/ 9.8 or what ever, just perfect 10.Edit: Played this game for 3-4 more hours and just I thought I was near end game, I was wrong LUL ( still haven't beat the game btw) 17.8 hours in.

Recommended,46.6,"																Code Vein has been fairly fun so far, the souls influences are showing through fantastically. This take that gives us weeb-souls just makes it even more enjoyable.The Good:-Character amazing, if you have an anime character you want to create, you have the freedom to do so, and any other way you want to represent yourself.-The story here is slower, but more fleshed out then any of the souls games, you feel for these characters, especially when you learn their pasts through the visages.-As a generally range or caster based character through all of these style of games, I thoroughly enjoyed getting new spells and abilities through the various gifts, always felt like a power house even if I suck at melee.-Companions in this game are a godsend, they have saved my ass more times then not, im especially glad for these, in souls I enjoyed playing with friends, having a companion makes up for that, then you add a companion and some of the areas just become better to deal with.-The map is useful, especially if you feel like you missed items, but otherwise its OK, it can still get confusing especially in the zones like Annoying Lando.The bad:-The enemy tracking can be down right cheating at times, they will turn on a dime mid swing and hit you even through rolls and blocks, it feels unfair at time. Bosses have the same bs as well, they will charge a swing up in front of them and then on a dime will turn towards you and hit you in the face, even after being behind them.-Leveling and stats in this game are interesting, in the beginning I didn't understand the stats and the scaling, leveling up didn't feel like you were getting stronger and the weapons weren't really explained how the stats worked. Later game its explained slightly better, but more often you will need to reach out to the community to better understand.-Difficulty is also a mixed bag, the game can feel easy at times especially in multiplayer with your AI teammates. But still have random spikes in difficulty. These are normally a skill/gear checks that make you take into account the weaknesses of yourself and the creature you are trying to fight if you cannot win on your skill alone. But those looking for an extreme challenge might not find it here-There are very very few weapons in this game, for example as a caster, generally using a bayonet, the designs were mostly similar. 50% of the game I used the same weapon and never deviated.-Each area has interconnection and shortcuts that make you say ""ow thats how its connected"" but overall the entire world is segregated and doesn't loop back in on itself. Also the walking areas between zones feel wasted and just used to hide loading times, because they are pointless.Overall this has been a very fun game with an interesting story and good multiplayer that is well worth picking up.

Recommended,31.7,"																i really dont know how to feel about this game. its really just worse dark souls in many ways but has its own way of doing things as well that keeps it interesting. the difficulty feels so iffy too, sometimes its stupidly hard but not dark souls level and othertimes its completely a joke. certain ""builds"" are completely dumb as well, ranged damage is a joke from my experience though to be honest i didnt beat the game yet but my friend one shotted literally everything with the 2 handed well anything melee aside from bosses which were so hard when they werent being a whole two shotted by my friend while im chiping 1/20 of their hp with the heavily limited ammo system thing though enemies i believe arent buffed at all in multiplayer so i just suck maybeother stuff like the skill system is in theory really cool! but in practice swapping builds on the fly doesnt work well at all though it can be done and almost none of it feels good to finick around, swapping classes and abilities so that you can master other abilites for some useless special attack ability that doesnt matter with guns/magic usually or an extremely boring passive. people that love like optimization will love this stuff probs but it doesnt feel good to get to a bonfire and then do skilling stuff for like 10 minutes, completely killing the pace.this is someones jam, but it isnt mine. either buy the game on sale if you think its interesting or refund it before the 2 hour mark to give its systems a try.

(I've beat it on xbox and here on pc)5: Queenslayer items feel too weak for being used to fight the Queen!6: The world is gorgeous, the weapon's are really dope (aesthetic wise), Graphic's are gorgeous for being anime style.7: No Difficulty options, so if you hate challenges dont play, but if you love a challenge i'd highly recommend!8: Campanion's feel a bit overpowered at time's.9: Animation's at time's feel ganky (if you use mods).10: Boss's feel like a boss, unless you have a one shot build.11: the multiplayer can be utter garbage at time's (mostly do to the fact that the developer's pretty much said no updates to the servers), Level design can be a bit confusing, that's why you can send a distress signal.

Recommended,47.9,"																This was not a great Soulslike, but it definitely was a fun SoulsLite. It takes the typical souls formula, and adds a big load of special moves and options to the combat system. I dare say there are so many options that they can become a bit confusing. But in the long run, all those options are rather ""nice to have"" than ""must have"" as Code Vein is never overly challenging. I would not call it an ""easy"" game, but compared to the Dark Souls games, or Nioh, this here feels a bit like a walk in the park. Two or three boss fights still granted me my share of yells and screams and curses. Which actually didn't directly have to do with the bosses, but with the controls of my character. Don't get me wrong, the combat controls are swift and responsive. But certain things just take forever. Drinking a healing potion feels like it takes forever. It's like my character performs a Japanese green tea ritual before finally taking the potion after finishing an ongoing character animation. Switching weapons takes forever too but healing is the most critical part. In the later game, you won't be lacking healing potions, but time becomes your worst enemy. Sadly, the bosses are... pretty lame. I have to admit, not one will stick to my mind. They are neither unique nor original nor spectacular. Most bosses can easily be defeated on first or second attempt. The harder bosses follow the same cheap formula that all weaker soulslikes use: teleport moves and oversized hitboxes. All boss fights take place in an open arena where the bosses can  happily warp from one side to the other. So actually the only real difficulty is to find the right time slot to heal, which takes a couple seconds in which the boss can teleport-finish you.  Second on the down list for me was the level design. It could be compared to the Nioh levels. Code Vein has no open world, but the world is fragmented into labyrinths. Literally. Graphics are generally pretty, but the levels are quite obviously designed to be mazes which at later levels can become a bit tiring. Like that cathedral where you spend a big deal of time running through criss crossed corridors that make no sense at all, searching for the way to proceed. At least check points are set very fairly so that you'll usually find a spot to rest when you really need it. Third on the down list is the story. There is one, so that's nice, but it's being told via dozens of superbly boring memory sequences. And at the end of the game, the sum of all those story fragments still left me with an ""Aha. Ok."" But yeah, all in all it still was a fun game. Combat works. The AI of your companions is actually worth its name. And your companions, and generally most NPCs, are interesting enough to spend some time figuring them out. It's fun trying different weapons or armor, taking different companions on your trips. It's fun trying to find secrets. The camera does its job. For those looking for a less punishing souls game, with fun action and pretty, Manga-style graphics, I'd say give it a try.			"

Recommended,46.6,"																A really good action RPG. I was initially hesitant to recommend this game when I was going through it. Reason is that there are just some lame parts to it that stick out so much for me. But as I look back to my experience, I definitely had fun and was excited by the rest of the game. The game plays like Dark Souls. No denying that. And I'm gonna be making a lot of comparisons just because it really is unavoidable. The inspiration is clearly there. You manage a stamina meter for your combat actions. Levels are dungeon crawls with intertwining paths and secrets. The game currency and experience points are one and the same. If you die, you lose both. And so much more similarities. But what's changed up here is that you have a plethora of spells/active abilities. And these ""spells"" aren't just traditional fantasy mage moves, they're also very useful for melee focused characters. Plus, the anime theme makes the moves flashy and cool.That last points brings me to what I like about this game so much. The actual RPG system is very open and rewards exploration. Throughout the game you'll get what are called Blood Codes. They're essentially skill trees of spells/active abilities and passives stat boosts. They help define what sort of RPG ""class"" your gonna play. You can freely switch between Blood Codes to help with whatever encounter you're facing. You can find a lot of them from loot drops, secrets, friendly characters, bosses, and rewards.Dark Souls combat really got me when I first played it. It was so good and I though to myself that I hope a lot of other action RPG's adopt it. And I've been going through quite a few RPG's that have tried to adopt that combat system with varying degrees of success. But this game comes in with the Blood Code system and says why not make the Dark Souls combat more flashy and ability focused. And it worked. The system is so fun and exciting to play with. And that is on top of already a fine tuned and fast paced Dark Souls like combat system. In Dark Souls and its sequels, I just hope for a new weapon type and rely on that to change up the game, maybe throw in the occasional mage spell to keep things exciting. But here the game got me excited for what new skill tree I will find, what new spells, passives, or moves will I get. Then I would couple that with whatever new weapon moves I'd play with. That let me then play out some fun combos, helped define new and exciting builds. Basically I was excited to progress through the game much like how I felt playing through Dark Souls for the first time.Now on to the mixed bag parts of the game. Half the levels kinda suck. They're so maze like which is not really bad idea on its own. But the paths and environments blend so much together that it's such a chore to explore and go through them. I was more often than not lost when going through them. And that made me hate exploring which is a big no no for me with RPG's. Then there's the story. I can't claim to be some big writer and all I can say is that the story is kinda lame. A lot of the times I just wanted to hit the skip button with the cutscenes. But I thought that would not be fair to the game. I gave it a chance to tell it's story and I just came out of it cringing or rolling my eyes. Good thing the gameplay was overall fun.EDIT: I forgot another lame part of the game. The encounter design sucked so badly. A lot of the time it's either an ambush or horde of enemies. They're not bad on their own but ambushes happen far too often. And despite the combat being more fast paced than what is usual with Dark Souls likes, the stamina regen doesn't keep up with that. So a lot of the time you have to ""pause the flow of combat"" to compensate for how stupidly slow it is to regen the stamina. Only way to compensate for it that I found was to either chug the painfully slow animation of the health potions or get a bigger stamina pool.Quick run on more cool things with the game. The allies in the game were a nice addition. They're definitely stronger and more reliable than what I'm used to with AI companions in games. But it's nice to have and a good way to help with difficult encounters in Dark Souls like games. No PVP modes but does have a decent co-op mode with some cute little emotes to play around with. Armor and weapon design are so cool. This is where the anime setting plays well into the game. The character creator is crazy in how many options there are. Definitely appreciate it. Plus you can at any point change up your looks. Also, the bosses themselves were actually fun to fight and got harder and harder by the end. Game is a bit grindy. But I kinda liked that because it let me have a way to max out whatever gear I want. Normally for other Dark Souls games you'd have to go through new game plus to do that. Just because late game upgrade materials would only ever be available once in a playthrough. Here you can just farm the side dungeons of the game called Depths.This review was a lot. But I think this game deserves it. I was initially just drudging through it. But ended up loving the whole thing. Thumbs up to this game!			"
Recommended,34,"																This is my first review so bare with!Really enjoyed this game back on console, so i HAD to get it on PC. If you like Dark Souls, you may end up liking this game. Its not as hard as DS but if you want an anime version of DS here it is. Its the perfect game for it, but instead of dragons, skeletons, demons and all other crazy stuff its vampires. If you can catch it on a sale i highly recommend getting it, i would say its worth full price but after the game being out 2 years this year, i would wait for a sale if had only come out this year, id say pay full price! The game play is great, its not like your normal hack and slash game, like you cant literally spam the action button. You have to parry, you to dodge you have to block. If you don't your health will literally die and you will die. You have multiple abilities to choose from so don't expect seeing only 4 classes or blood codes they are called in this game. For the story you play this typical anime hero and the world has completely go haywire, your in a constant loop where if you die you remember it (well the other characters do) . You have these abilities where you can relive other people memories that have been forgotten. There is 14 core areas to explore and the worst one is the maze, i spent about 3-4 hours completing the whole thing first time playing. You don't have to complete the area before going on to the next as you can go back, but i HIGHLY recommend exploring everywhere before moving on! I'm not gonna say it the perfect story because there is some parts where you wont understand at all. There is 3 ending to this game but i wont say much. If your only interested in the story don't buy the DLC unless you enjoy the game. All in all i give the game an 8/10 only thing that could that could possibly bring it up to a 10/10 is they bring up the player limit from 3 to 4, having 3 players is good but 4 would be better in my opinion.

Recommended,187.7,"																Character Customization [8/10]Storyline [6/10]Animation and Graphics [7/10]Weapons, Enemies and Combat [7/10]Diffiuculty [7/10]Story Playthrough Time : 35-50hrs (probably more if you grind and experiment with builds) Character Customization Character customization is abundant with options, sliders and settings to make your character your own (though probably not to the degree of Soul Calibur). Clothing choices are quite limited but character features and accessories are plentiful enough that you can get carried away tweaking every slight detail. The voice packs generally all sound the same but that doesn't matter since your character basically gets 0 speaking lines throughout the game. Storyline (NO SPOILERS) I'm personally not a fan of the storytelling; the game tries to reconcile the backstory of the Revenants in a very awkward fashion - scouring the map for Vestiges which you then bring back to the Home Base so that you can enter a theatre-esque depiction of the memories of your fellow Revenants. While there is some semblance of lore hidden within, most of the memories don't carry much emotional weight and seem rather arbitrary. Going through the memories (which you can skip if you're not interested in the lore) only gives an inkling of each NPC's motives, leaving many questions left unanswered. The lack of dynamic character development throughout the story coupled with the somewhat stiff animation and limited unique character interactions makes for very impersonal characters. Also, as a side result of the majority of lore being packed into the memories, actual story progression through the normal game cutscenes is painstakingly slow.  Animation and Graphics CV is more GPU intensive so if you have a graphics card made in the past 3/4 years, chances are you probably could run this game at max graphic settings without any worries.  I'm personally running a 3900X/RX470 at 1080p60 without a hitch. With that being said, the graphics are STUNNING. Code Vein utilizes a good blend of cel-shading for the characters and vibrant, realistic textures for the terrain, something which I found a little jarring initially but grew on me eventually. Not sure if I'm being pedantic but I've noticed some environmental assets being reused across the different stages which affects my immersion. I get that level design is a difficult task, especially on this scale, but this is a bit disappointing especially coming from a huge game company like Bandai Namco.Animation in general is smooth but can at times look very robotic or unnatural. Might just be me but dear god some of the characters look downright creepy because their iris and pupils don't really move when they look at things.   Enemies, Weapons and Combat Adequate variety of The Lost (enemies) that go from ""kill him before he gets to attack"" to ""sir please stop beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of me that's illegal"". Enemies are well spread out through the levels with most of them patrolling the map/hiding somewhere waiting to ambush you and the rest in ""strongholds"" which you'll either have to muscle/sneak your way through. Enemy AI could be improved upon but if you play through it without paying too much attention it shouldn't be noticeable. Bosses will beat the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of you just like in any souls-like games.When I first started, weapons/blood veils were one of the most confusing aspects of the game and it took me way too long to figure out how to optimize builds. These items have a stat screen that takes up 2/3 of the screen with dozens of number and ranks floating about without any real explanation in the tutorial. It's intuitive enough but you'll probably need to sit down and look through the different stats properly if you want to min/max. If you're familiar with other souls-like game, you might find yourself having an easier time than I did.As for variety, you'll probably find a weapon and blood veil that suits your taste; heavy, light, ranged are all options that can cater to your play-style. Weapons and blood veils can also be upgraded or transformed to increase the stats and give attributes. Materials to do so are adequate and can be obtained through a reasonable amount of farming. The Blood-Code gifts and ichor system feels very well balanced, meaning that you don't have to be too stingy with your skills but exercising prudence might pull you through some tough fights. The Blood-Code mechanic is relatively easy to understand and proves to be a very vital part of combat game-play, as it was intended.The combat system is adequate; the parry, dodge, block options are all viable and responsive; the enemy lock-on feature makes combat much more manageable. Parry timing and hit-boxes seem to be a little funky at times but otherwise this game checks most of the boxes for a souls-like game. Conclusion For the hefty price, I would honestly say that the game was a little bit of a let-down. As someone who really appreciates a good storyline, this game sorely misses the mark. However, where credit is due, this game has been a very enjoyable and immersive souls-like experience sprinkled with bits of flashy and satisfying attacks/finishers that my inner edgelord can definitely get behind. All this is packaged into a game with a very ambitious cel-shaded souls-like direction that I can see myself spending just a little bit more of time on. Get it on sale and you'll probably be getting your money's worth.			"
Recommended,69.6,"																Such a fun game with an interesting story!I was going to be lazy and keep it like that but I really do rather love this game so I must go on a little about it.I could describe the rich combat system that doesn't allow you to slack off for a moment, always on your toes and ever devising new strategies and optimizing every blood code and gift you acquire. Or should I praise the little details like how smooth and beautiful all the models and their animations are, How on Earth did they make the breast physics impeccably realistic, here's another I appreciate that I rarely see games get right; The contrast of the characters and the dark tones of the world all blend and coexist in a harmony of visibly satisfying perfection that to call it anything less that masterful would be a dishonor to their efforts. I could continue with things like how great the characters were, or how when you deep dive into the fragmented memories of others and only bits of the world are present in the void of memory, representing remembering the directly observed important parts... Oops, I got side tracked again. To sum it up, Highly recommend!			"

Recommended,46.4,"																The game plays a lot like dark souls and is seriously a game that can fill your souls-like craving. Death is punishing, yet a rewarding learning experience. It is a game that rewards patience and discipline just like dark souls.I highly, highly recommend this game if you like dark souls. I do however, do not recommend it if you hated dark souls or hate very punishing dungeon crawler style games. This game has no easy mode/story mode for anyone who wants to just enjoy the story. If you want to progress, you gotta kill that boss, and the only thing stopping you from killing that boss is you. If this is your first rondo with games like this, do not quit. It is a very rewarding style of game that once you figure it out you will be wondering how you ever died to stuff the previous boss or enemy did to you. Last but not least... You can make your dream waifu and play through a souls-like experience! I never thought I'd see an anime version of dark souls, but this is the closest thing I got and I love it. Hope this review helps!			"
Recommended,"1,153.80","																For a long time, I've wanted to do more in Dark Souls because its gameplay is incredibly fun to me. However, I'm willing to admit I don't exactly have the patience for games that destroy you and still expect you to piece a story together through item descriptions, meaning you likely wouldn't understand what's happening unless you found every item ever. THIS GAME, HOWEVER, has its story up front and is gentler since it gives you a partner to work with. With those two factors, it made me go from thinking ""ugh, it's time for more self-inflicted CBT"" to ""Wow, this game is amazing, and I can't put it down!"". This is my most recent game on steam, and in a single playthrough alone, became one of my most played games on the platform. I did everything you possibly could do in a single playthrough, and the final time I had at the end was 74 hours, 34 minutes and 45 seconds. And I don't regret one. Single. Minute. This game is what would happen if Dark Souls and a JRPG had a child blessed by god and anime. If you like Dark Souls, check it out. If you like JRPGs, check it out. If you like anime, check it out. If you like the option to play with friends for an easier time, play normally for the average experience, or the option to turn off companions to make yourself suffer more than any FROM Soft game ever could, CHECK. IT. OUT.			"

Love the game.I recommend it!			"
Not Recommended,22.2,"																I am not big in reviewing games, however, I feel like I cannot miss reviewing this one. In the few hours I have played this game, I have been nothing short of amazed. The character creator is amazing and it can allow you to get creative with the character you make. Character development, story telling, and voice acting are incredible, since there wasn't a time when I didn't immediately sit back up to watch a cut-scene or listen to character dialogue. Combat is well developed, with many unique features that make Code Vein stand out from any other souls-like game. With multiple endings and achievements to obtain, this game offers a good amount of replayability.I'd give this game a 9.2/10 without a doubt. The only reason why I wouldnt make it a 10/10 is because of the random clippings characters make during animations or cutscenes, the intensity of these clippings may depend on how much hair players put on their characters, but they also apply to NPCs during cutscenes as well. Overall, it is a game worth purchasing at full price.			"

Recommended,32.9,"																Code Vein is good. Like, really good. It's a souls-like with an anime aesthetic centered around a conflict for the survival of both humans and the new race of revenants. It's got style, heart, and soul.Before going any further, there will be countless comparisons to Dark Souls in the Gameplay Section. Don't whine at me, this game has taken SO much inspiration from Dark Souls that it's parody. It is literally Anime Dark Souls. Don't get your panties in a twist. Also I won't spoil anything past the first half hour of the game.Starting with the Story, you're a revenant whom just awoke in a ruined world, and you're thrust into a warground between Revenants and the Lost. You'll meet some people to make a home base, and from there the story takes off. It honestly feels like a two part movie, it's quite the tale it tells. Sometimes the pacing can be a bit off, but everything ends up flowing together quite nicely. HOWEVER, there are memory segments that you are not required to go through, but are tied to your character's ability progression. These memory segments flesh out the lore and characters, but are very tedious to go through one by one. I did cry a tiny bit at the end though. Did I mention you have choices, and those affect your story and ending in a tangible way? I didn't? Well now I did. Lastly, this game is sad. It's heartbreaking. It will break your heart and then smash it into pieces. You've been warned.Performance wise, the game runs smoothly 99% of the time. The occasional hiccup will occur, but they're few and far between.Graphics are gorgeous, with amazing locations to view and detailed character models. Characters are, however, probably the worst part of the graphics in terms of their technical prowess. Hair clips through facial/upper-body clothing, fabric will cascade over nothing or get stuck on limbs as they move around. Other than that, 9/10 on the graphics. Also, the character creation screen is something you WILL sink time into if you have any care for how your character looks. It's REALLY in-depth. And for those of your who care, most female enemies/npcs have a rather... accentuated form. There's jiggle physics, there's no subtly. If for some reason that bothers you, now you know. I personally don't mind it.Game Audio is good, nothing too special, but... the voice acting for the english dub is MAJORLY miss-casted for the most part. I prefer JP audio anyways, but if English dub is good enough I'll sometimes stick with it. This is not one of those exceptions.Music, OH GOD THE MUSIC. IT IS HEAVENLY. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Orchestral music adorns every important moment, the vocals are simply stunning, and IT'S SIMPLY FLAWLESS. Honestly one of my favorite Game OSTs of this decade. Personal Preference and all.Lastly, the kicker, Gameplay.Honestly? This game is an easier Dark Souls. Now I'm not a purist, nor will I act all high and mighty. This game has mechanics that make it easier while still keeping the essence of a Souls-like intact. It's still difficult, but if you want to get into Souls-like games, this might be a good introduction.You will have everything in this that you have in Dark Souls. Bonfires are now Mistles. Flasks are now Regeneration (Set amount of healing, still restored at bonfire/mistle.) You can backstab. Souls are now Haze. You have 5 types of weapons, and 4 types of blood veil. Weapons are just that, weapons. Blood Veils on the other hand are your armor, and part of your abilities. You see, Blood Veils, based on their type, will change how you parry or drain enemies. (you can drain enemies to gain Ichor, I'll explain it later). Parrying is a ♥♥♥♥♥. You have to predict not the timing itself, but when your enemy's weapon will hit a certain part of your blood veil after charging the parry action. Yeah no thanks. Backstabbing is a bit off, but works 99% of the time it's supposed to. Ichor can be used to activate gifts, which are special abilities you can learn. Fire bolt, temporary attack buff, all that kinda stuff. Ichor can be gained via draining an opponent via backstabs, parries, lunges, or via weapons that drain. Bosses have attacks that can be learned and then adapted too, but you'll still need to focus. Dodging has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of I-frames, so that makes the game a bit easier. The big things that makes the game so much easier is AI companions. They will destroy bosses while the boss focuses you if you can stay alive. They can die, but you can sacrifice your own health to keep them alive. They can do the same for you if you die. This essentially gives you the ability to try again without losing progress if you die, or keep the boss busy while your companion kills it. Also, with multiplayer, you can have a friend and your AI companion all wail on the boss. I had some bosses where I beat it on the first attempt even though I played terribly, simply because my companion wailed on it and gave me a second chance, twice. It's really forgiving at times, but still requires patience and focus.Overall, Code Vein is a very satisfying souls-like that feels like a two part movie of an epic saga. It's honestly really good, and I highly recommend it.			"
Recommended,263.3,"																It's a really good game, worth playing!Code Vein is my first soul-like game (and my first anime game too), and it absolutely surprised me!Character customization is great!I'm not an anime fan but the customization really gives me a lot of choices and satisfies me. There are a lot of mods on Nexus as well.Game skills/mechanics are great! I'm a Monster Hunter World (bow one-trick), Overwatch, and Apex player, so the mechanics of this game is totally new to me. It's not hard to play NG or NG+ as long as i had a reasonable build, and the the wide selection of skills with low requirements also allow me to try out different weapons and builds. TBH, it's sand-box like skill selection makes every style of play possible in NG+! But be aware, I can also make an insane DPS build to cheese the game, but really, the unlimited possibility of skill combinations is what really make this game unique.Story is awesome!I've played a lot of story driven games before (tomb raider series, Titanfall 2, etc.). Bandai absolutely nailed the story! The story is so touching that I did not skip any cutscene during my 4 game play-thrus. it's one of the best stories in-game I had so far. Gear selections and Bloodcodes are OKcompare with MHW, this game has way less gears, and I can tell there are something missing. Hopefully more gears will come out with DLC in early 2020. Bloodcodes need a balance so that there will be a variety of bloodcode use between user not just several best ones.Co-op is what differ this game than DS series the most i think.I had fun experiences in co-op with people in same region (people fro other region are friendly and fun to play too, its just the lag that's killing me). it makes game far more entertaining after sever NG+ runs and it's also helpful for people who are new to soul-like games!I recommend this game to people who wants to try RPG, Soul-like, or anime game. I've spent a good time with it and hopfully you do too!			"

Recommended,51.7,"																Code Vein is Bandai Namco's own take on the souls-like genre made by fromsoft and published by them. The game is dubbed ""anime-souls"" and deserves its title. The story, characters, art, effects and combat are pretty polished and it is fun to play again and again. The game lets you build in a way that you can compeletely change your build from a tank to a glass cannon mage in mere seconds mid-fight, which adds a lot of replayability and build variety.			"
Recommended,123.6,"																Fully modeled, Io's Ios, decent action game, decent difficulty. It's really a love letter to dark souls and I can feel the God Eater devs making a full effort in branching out of their comfort zone. The character editor is top notch quality stuff, lack of boob slider and stature slider are mild disappointments. Looking forward to the next title.			"

Its a solid souls-borne experience minus the hidden story line, well sorta.

So enjoy Big tiddy vampire anime waifu souls.			"

Recommended,74.1,"																Honestly I did not expect to love this game this much! The graphics are amazing, the story is super rich and fun, and the customization, oooh the customization gives you so many options that you can create any character that you imagine (I spent alot of time just doing that xD). I'm truly looking forward to the DLC's and my expectations are high! I recommend this game full-heartedly ♥			"
Recommended,58.7,"																Been having a lot of fun! Gameplay is difficult but not so difficult that you can't play. Tactics are actually useful which is pretty cool. I of course love the character creation and art style, and the world is pretty cool too! I also enjoy the skill/class system and think its pretty unique, though i wish certain classes wouldn't require certain weapon types be equipped to use them and therefore to level them up properly. I think the voice acting is absolutely horrrrrible so i skip most of the cutscenes and couldn't tell you what the story is about. Overall, i'm having fun and would recommend it, especially if you see it on sale. Its a cool game, but i ended up spending $84 after taxes for the game + season pass and i'd say so far, i'd probably have preferred to spend $40 or even have it have been free to play with a subscription. Its not all that different from other f2p games with monthly subs..			"
Recommended,57.1,"																So i finished this one.Gotta say i pretty much loved playing Code Vein.I played Dark Souls once and let me tell you one thing, Code Vein is easier than Dark Souls, this game is practically easier Dark Souls for anime lovers.Story is nothing special but still works for me, kinda hoped for love story too, but nah, this one is not this type of game.Gameplay works but details imo are not up to, same goes for enemies, some definitely are detailed with combos but most are simple ones.So basically i would say this game deserves 7.5 out of 10 ofc.If we ever see Code Vein and i belive we will i hope guys at the Bandai Namco upgrade everything, foundations are there but with a lot of tweaking to do.Give this one a chance.			"
Recommended,22.5,"																Code Vein is a solid Dark Souls style game with an extremely high level character creator.  The character creator gives you a huge latitude to customize your look across a spectrum of pretty characters to characters that look like they'd be at home with the Joker.  Mechanically, the game also has a nice feature that allows you to switch classes easily without having to worry about investing points as you level into specific stats.  There is also the ability to move abilities to different classes if you use them enough once unlocked, which gives the game some decent variety.  You also have the ability to have an NPC partner along at all times.  I found this to be especially helpful early on while I was still grappling with the controls.  Over time, the game seemed to factor this into the difficulty relatively well.  The story is passable.  As the game progresses, the characters are developed in interesting ways over time, but the foundation looks very much like standard apocalyptic story lines in Anime and Manga.  As a result, I'd say as long as you can tolerate that type of story and Souls style gameplay, you'll probably enjoy Code Vein.			"

Recommended,65.6,"																-Very good souls like game that differs itself from the other with its unique artstyle and bloodcode system enabling a wide range of easily changeable builds.-Story itself is decent but the worldbuilding and character stories found along the way stand out in both how theyre shown to the player as well as how much thought appears to have been put into each characters backstory for the (sometimes little) amount of screentime they get. -Enjoyed the variance of level design and how each area brings a different obstacle to overcome ( eg:fire hazards, large pitfalls, maze like areas or snow level) as well as extremely unique visual flare and design to each area. while ive seen lots of complaints about getting lost in the cathedral there are item to serve as markers that can stop this issue.-character creator is super in depth and open up loads of possibilites -while easier than other similar games i found that playing without an ai partner taking aggro away from you actually increased the difficulty considerably by not only taking aggro and outputting damage but also leaving me with less opportunites to use items, spells or heals. While losing out on some potential charcter and story interaction id recommend this for people wanting a real challange. As well as this the new game plus difficulty is also a huge jump form the original with ai companions regularly dieing during larger fights or boss battles where i used them.-Overall a great game that i can recommend for both fans of the ""souls like"" genre or those who like more anime aesthetic action games			"

Recommended,10.3,"																Gonna be writing a quick summary of each of the game's elements and rating them out of 5. The long and short of it is as follows.Code Vein is a Dark Souls-inspired game about anime vampires fighting anime zombies, basically. There's a large range of classes for optimizing a build, each one with some pretty unique abilities which you acquire throughout the course of the game. You can play with an AI partner, as well as summon a player-controlled companion for a short time. There are 5 different weapon types and 4 different armor types, and each weapon handles differently in various ways, so your fighting style is pretty unique. Overall, I can recommend this game strongly, with only minor gripes about the controls and the multiplayer.Here's the nitty-gritty of it.Story: 5/5Your character is a vampire (revenant), an undying creature that can respawn as long as their heart isn't damaged in combat. As a vampire, you need to drink human blood, or you'll turn into a zombie (the Lost). However, humans are pretty rare, so most vampires resort to finding blood trees (bloodsprings) and eating their fruits (blood beads) to survive. Each vampire has a class (blood code), except your character, who can use any class.As long as you get most of that stuff above, you should be fine. The only real issue I have with the story is in the way it's presented. I've been using the terms ""vampires"", ""zombies"", ""classes"" and such, but those terms aren't actually in the game. It's ""revenants"", ""the Lost"", and ""blood codes"", which is a bit hard to get a grasp on. After you get the basic rundown though, it's a pretty straightforward story, with a cast of lovable bros and waifus that I think most people will enjoy. I like the fact that your character does play a big part in the story, even though there aren't many voiced lines for him/her.Gameplay: 4/5The gameplay can be boiled down into three parts - exploration, fighting, and boss fighting.Exploring the world of the game is pretty simple and fun. The environments are post-apocalyptic and give me a bit of a Fallout vibe, but they're interesting to look at and unique from level to level, which I appreciate. Some of the levels have environmental hazards unique to them, which encourages players to optimize a build or stay on their toes while exploring. Most of the levels are designed in a straightforward and easy-to-navigate pattern, barring one level which keeps the gameplay from a straight 5.The fighting is the meat-and-potatoes of the game. I found the hacking and slashing action very addictive thanks to great sound cues, special moves, and really cool animations. The gifts, while usually meant for buffing your character, are all pretty unique and make an appreciable difference in combat. Your only real defense is your ability to dodge and block; there are a lot of creatures that can 1-shot you or perma-stun you, which is frustrating, but I feel like it's not impossibly hard.Fighting bosses in this game is a lot different than fighting normal monsters though. You often can't block a lot of their attacks, can't inflict debuffs, and you'll be 1-shot more often than not. The trick here is to learn the boss' moveset and predict what they'll do next, finding openings to strike and heal. Don't be too greedy, and don't get too frustrated; there are bosses which will pancake you into the ground if you so much as look at them wrong, but that makes it all the sweeter when you manage to kill them.Controls: 3/5I'm sure that, with a proper controller, the game handles fine. However I played this game on PC, and the default PC controls are total crap. I ended up remapping almost all the keys just to be able to play the game, and there are still some abilities that are pretty hard for me to use simply because my hands don't stretch that far. The gift menu in particular is a nightmare to use; you have 8 slots but have to hold down the Shift key to open the menu. If your fingers are on WSAD it's pretty hard to use your 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th slots, since they're bound to 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively. Parry is C, which isn't really the best for reactivity, and block is left Alt, which also isn't good for reactivity. Thankfully you can remap the keys, as I said before, but before doing so I basically didn't use gifts at all, which is a huge part of the game.Design: 5/5I feel like Bandai Namco nailed the design of this game, specifically the music and characters. It's a 3D game, but in an anime artstyle which gave me some RWBY vibes. The character creator is very extensive, and what sold me on this game, although I would prefer a few more clothing options. Still, I appreciate that your character doesn't look incredibly out-of-place when standing next to the other characters, unless you really want to make it so, which can add to the humor of some scenes. You can customize your character's appearance at pretty much any time during the game, and save customizations for later if you like them.The music and sound design is also worth a mention here; while I found some of the tracks to be a little bit repetitive, I mostly enjoyed the background music. There's a lot of orchestral pieces which are used for bossfights and other important scenes, a lot of solo singing pieces, and a couple of rock songs by VAMPS, a band which definitely deserves more credit. The sound effects for your weapons are pretty satisfying too, each weapon feels like it does a lot of damage simply because of the sound it makes when you hit something. Overall, just a beautifully designed game.Multiplayer: 2/5My biggest gripe about this game is the multiplayer. The multiplayer system is very basic - you send out a ""distress signal"" as an invite to your game, or you can search for such signals to join other peoples' games. The friend you summon gets leveled appropriately to your character, however the party cannot rest at a checkpoint until the summon is dismissed. The whole system seems clunky to me. There's no free-roam lobby, no PvP, no queuing up to play with others, and there's no friend system, so there's no way to ensure you play with the same player twice unless you collaborate outside the game. There's also no ingame chat, your only communication is with ""gestures"" which, while customizable to a degree, just feels awkward and slow.I was expecting a little bit more like a Left 4 Dead type co-op, with players being able to lobby up with other players and play together through the entire campaign, or at least through a single level. I haven't seen a multiplayer game fail to deliver so spectacularly in a while, which is a pretty big disappointment. I play multiplayer games to make friends, but when there's no way to add or chat with your fellow players, you can't do that with Code Vein.I'm hoping that the game gets an update which fixesSo, here's the breakdown:Story: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Controls: 3/5Design: 5/5Multiplayer: 2/5Overall: 3.8/5In short, Code Vein is a good game. It's a game that I can strongly recommend to anyone who's already a fan of Dark Souls or Bloodborne, or even anime in general. Its strong story and excellent design make up for its shortcomings as far as controls and multiplayer goes, however I'm still hoping that multiplayer gets an update. If these issues are ironed over I'd be glad to give this game a higher rating, but as it is this is how I see all the points.			"

Recommended,166,"																OVERALLThis game is Awesome! I was never one to play dark souls or any game similar to it. With this being my intro to that type of game I love this! The amount of customization through class building and even character creation allows for hours of just tweaking things to find what best fits your look and play style! The game is fun and challenging with many different views and locations to explorer and different types of foes to slay.If your a fan of dark souls you will feel at home with this game and bringing new stuff to the table making it unique! For anyone that is a fan of anime, adventure, 3rd person game play give this a try! There is so much more this game has to offer and wont be a game that you can run through in just a few short hours.CO-OPI have seen some people say not to get this game if your looking for a co-op experience. I have been playing the entire story through with a friend so you can play with a friend! Now with that the progress does not save for the person that joins your game so you would have to help them through on their save as well. none of this bothered me though and we are still both able to enjoy the story and game with co op!The co-op works like a help request, where a player can join in and help you through a level once that level is completed or if you or that player dies they will be removed from your game back to their own but its as simple as them joining your game again and trying again!BUGSI've only come across a few bugs for this game and nothing game breaking which is good! they seem to only take place in a co-op setting. where the joined character would turn invisible apart from weapon in hand and is unable to move, and once a character joins a bit of lag spike when they first join but no big deal.Love this game!If you have questions or if you think you should get the game leave a comment on my review!

Recommended,52.4,"																Have finished the game once so far and thoroughly enjoyed it.Runs pretty well on my rig, only noticed a few frame drops here and there, otherwise it was a consistent 60fps. The character creator is out of this world in terms of the options you have to play with.As for gameplay - it's a fairly serviceable dark souls-esque combat style. It seems a bit shallow at first, but the more 'Blood Codes' (Read: Character Classes) you unlock throughout the game really gives it an extra layer of depth - coupled with the fact you can switch Blood Codes on the fly and completely change your playstyle at the drop of a hat.Story is fine too - if you like anime it'll probably be enjoyable for you. Characters generally speaking are enjoyable-if-tropey and the world the game introduces you to is quite interesting.The music is also quite good, though a few tracks get repetitive the overall quality of the soundtrack is great.Overall: If you like anime, character creators and souls-like games (in that order) then I'd definitely pick this up, there's even multiple endings and a NG+, so there's decent replay value into the bargain.

Recommended,47,"																I'm quite obsessed with this game. I have to wake up for work very soon and I'm still there trying stuff out.Souls X Bloodborn X JRPG (for the better and the worst)Combat is a blast. You can fight the good old soulsborne way, dodging and blocking, backstab, parry, blablabla...Or you can use the gift systeym, where you use mana to cast skills. But in contrary to BB/DS3 where mana is a finite resource, in CV, anything you do (attack, critical, blocking, dodging, even dealing poison damage) can give you back ichor, leading to an infinity of different possible playstyles...The partner system allows you to breeze through the story with OP sidekicks. But if you want some spanking, dismiss them.The RPG customisation is where the game truly shines. You get a LOT of classes with their pros and cons, and then as you master skills, you get to mix and match actives and passives to create the most op and rewarding character.THE AI TALKS TOO MUCH.Music is nice.Give this game some love. We need more good souls likes			"
Recommended,47.7,"																Trying to review this game since I really enjoy this game so far . Sorry for some broken English since English is not my main language.Story : 9/10With 3 Major Ending this game is actually have a solid story telling , you can learn every character background story by collecting their Vestige.The story is easier to follow and more straight forward compare than soulborne seriesGameplay : 8.5/10They said it's similar with Soulsborne game , but as far I experience they only take the major system from it ( like soul system for upgrade/level/buying stuff/etc ).As for weapon choice there's 5 main weapon type , but EVERY weapon that exist on the game have a different move sets so check out each of them if you interested with that. also the Armor(Blood Veil) have a lot choice with every different animation for backstab/parry.As for status build they depend on your Blood Code equip & equipment transformation, but make sure check your weight & compatibility for every gear you use.As for combat the battle actually pretty solid and fun , but yeah backstabbing / parry will not easy on this game unlike soulborne/sekiro series.The Difficulty is very relaxing on new game , with the help of AI that can ressurect you if you died. It's feels really easy on New Game compare with soulsborne game , but once you tried NG+ with enhance difficulty the ""real"" difficulty game will start here...For the character creation , I really enjoy it so many things that you can add and mix-up to make a very unique characters for yourself. I could say this is one might be best for character creation.The only problem on this game is actually the maps design , Especially on 4th area . Even on NG+ with 100% map unlock you might lost on this area. Everything somehow looks very identical so you might confuse a lot if you not memorize the maps.Music : 10/10I really love their BGM & Theme Songs... the battle BGM feels nice with the tempo of battle. As for the Theme Songs they really perfectly match with the Story . Ending theme also very lovely, but the best is All of You theme .Final Score : 9/10If you love soulborne series try this one , It might feels different but it's fun. For those scared this game will be harder or equal hard as soulborne series , don't worry it's fun and easy as long as you not touching NG+ difficulty increase xD.			"

Recommended,107.4,"																First things first;Spoiler-free review, so you can read without any concerns of being spoiled.I bought the deluxe edition, i have 45 hours (steam is lying to you saying i only spend 33 lol) in and got my first ending (true ending). I collected all the vestiges and collected as much bloodcodes as i could on my first playthrough, depending what you do, you can get different codes, so multiple playthroughs are necessary to have all the bloodcodes. I also unlocked all of the depth maps and pretty much did everything you could do in one playthrough. I played the game SOLO, i like a challenge and the AI partner makes the game too easy for me (i am a souls veteran). If you never played those games before, you can keep the AI partner to balance things out.Now on to the review:To start things off, the story is well-written and the lore is interesting.It does not have much plot-holes (if any) and it kept me going until the end.The characters you meet are kind of bland and do not really have a lot of depth, even with the memories you can unlock of the characters. Their personalities are pretty flat and generic. Nobody really has an outstanding personality, which could be improved upon if they ever make a sequel.Life expectancy is about 25 hours if you do a few side quests and main-story, depending how good you are as a player of course. if you want to go all the way, there is NG+ with a higher difficulty option to boot. I expect to have about 80 to 90 hours in the game before i will wait for the DLC.Now the meat of the game - gameplay.The combat is varied and very interactive. The insane amount of bloodcodes and gifts you get makes you thinker on for hours if you want to make a specific build. I went for a 2-handed weapon build first time through, with NG+ on the horizon, i will make a nuke mage and see where things go. When you master certain classes, you can use most of their abilities on other classes as well, so you can mix and match to your play-style. This can be done through playing with the class, or to use certain materials (MJ310 for example) that can be found in the world and by defeating enemies. Combat can feel a bit ""stiff"" if you came straight from darksouls 3 or bloodborne, but it get a lot more flow later on when you unlock all the cool gifts (you can change dodges for example).Graphics are pretty dated for a 2019 title (even if this game was released in 2017, it would still look outdated). Unreal Engine 4 has its usual quirks with short environmental draw-distance of models (rocks for example) and texture pop-in, but nothing noticeable unless you really go focus on it. I am VERY susceptible to these things and i did not notice it until way later in the game. Aside from that, it is not an ugly game, aesthetics are pleasing although the environment could use more color (i get it is a apocalyptic setting, but a bit more color aside from black/yellow/brown would be nice). Environments are not really special, it feels very corridor-like, but some areas are H.U.G.E, and most noticeable, all of them feel like mazes. If you would not have a map, you could feel lost completely in some maps.The difficulty of the game is fair, this is based on my solo playthrough (no AI companion or online). I would expect if people have no experience in these type of games (souls-like action rpg) the AI companion would be a welcome boon. Beware though, if you do have a companion, these will chatter your ears off to no end. ""oh look a chest i wonder what is inside - i would not want to fight those enemies - wow what an interesting place"" etc. - usually small talk, but can get very annoying if you can't stand these kind of companions. I suppose it could define as an additional difficulty, trying to keep sane while playing with a companion. If you are a souls veteran like me, i would advice a solo playthrough if you don't want it to be *too* easy.There is an online mode, you can co-op with your friends to play the game.I heard from a friend of mine the bosses scale with HP if you have a human companion, so beware. Progress is made, just like darksouls, the host is progressing and the person who joined will still need to do their own stuff. As far as i know, you do not get anything special from helping people with bosses or areas, no sunlight medals for the helpers sadly. At least you get satisfaction from helping them right?...RIGHT?Enemy variety is somewhat of a problem, it is not as bad as Nioh, but it is getting awfully close. I think there are 14 or 15 unique enemies in the game, after that, they all have a variant of that unique model. So if you encounter an enemy with a shield, you will encounter the same enemy, but with a model swap (let's say the first one is a generic hollow with shield, then the second one has green tints and some deformations, but they attack the same way).After the tutorial area and the first real area, you almost have seen half of all the enemies of the game in that regard. The varieties are not bad per-se, but it does have a pattern.Bosses are generally solid (7/10), i had no boss that i would think ""oh, you clearly need to have a partner with this boss"" - so if you want to go solo like me, then you do not have to worry about it. Only thing i wanted were more bosses. Quality over quantity of course, but the bosses were not outstanding, so a few more of them would not hurt the experience.The design of the bosses are good, most of them have a female design to them, so if you are into kinky stuff you will find yourself right at home.Music is somewhat lacking, there are some base and drum beats during combat, but nothing really memorable. The boss music really tries to be dark souls, but fails at doing so. It is not bad, but not really good either. Ambient sounds are nice, but it consist mostly of wind and water drops. Sadly, this is the shortest part of the review,  i cannot review what is not there.There are 2 or 3 really good songs, but if that is all the game has to offer, it is not worthy of a notation in my opinion.Character creation.I feel this deserves its own section since it is so vast. At the start of the game you make your own character, this character will be seen in all cut-scenes, although the end-result with the clothes could be a turn-off. You have a vestment equipped at all times during combat areas and it conflicts with the outfit you made in the creator. You do get to see your whole creation in the base hub of the game (firelink shrine if you will). You can pretty much make every anime waifu / husbando you want with the creator, the creator alone could be a game on itself to be honest.TLDR:If i would give it a rating, i would give it an 8,5/10.It is a very solid game with a lot of customization options for your character (creator) and play-style. There is plenty to do and the story is pretty interesting if you get into it.Pro's:*Good story*GREAT gameplay*A lot of classes and skills to choose from to fit your play-style*Character creator*Boss battlesCon's*Bland main cast*Environment could use less maze-like layout*Forgettable music outside of 3 tracks*Enemy varietyIf you feel i forgot something or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask in the comments!

Recommended,17,"																This game is Hella addicting. I'm not one for Soul-like games as I don't really get far in them but, I at least make progress in the story and enjoy learning the boss movements without being stuck there for ages in Code Vein. I think with my second play through I'll not take any NPC's for the extra challenge. (:			"
Recommended,11.7,"																Anime Souls best Souls.Bit of a weird feel in terms of comparison to Dark Souls; but once you stop treating it as a ""Dark Souls Clone,"" and learn to work with the combat system Code Vein has in place - this game becomes an absolute blast.Would thoroughly recommend for anyone who is a fan of the Soulsborne series, ESPECIALLY so if you enjoyed a little FashionSouls - this game should MORE than scratch that itch if you can get down with the more anime ascetic presented in CV.

Recommended,65.8,"																I’m about nine hours into Code Vein and loving every second of it.You’re going to hear many people compare this game to Dark Souls and it’s for good reason. A lot of the boss fights and even mechanics are lifted right from that game. I do find the combat to be a bit tighter and faster though, something I very much prefer. Speaking of combat you have a lot of different styles here. You have various spells, abilities, and weapons you can equip. Lots of options on how to take on enemies. On the topic of options this has got to be one of the most robust character creators I have seen in a long while. The options for customization seem endless. Code Vein also allows you to tweak your appearance in the actual game as well. If you’re tired of your current hairstyle do not fret! You can change it whenever you wish. As of now I find myself heavily invested in the story. I won’t spoil anything here. All I’ll say is I didn’t expect a deep story for this sort of game, but I was very happily wrong. The multiplier is fantastic as well. At any point you can signal someone for help or join someone who is seeking aid. It’s drop in and drop out multiplayer at it’s best. All I knew upon purchasing the game was that Code Vein followed in the footsteps of Dark Souls. But as I continue to play I find myself diving deeper and deeper into the story and enjoying every aspect of it. Don’t miss this one. 			"
Not Recommended,27.6,"																Code Vein is in every sense a fun to play game. Its hard but not DS3 levels, the exploration is fun the combat is smooth.From my initial impressions, the story seems interesting enough to keep me invested, a big plus since the combat is not as polished and is a bit 'floaty' but in no way lacking.It of course is not as good as DS3 but still satisfying and complex enough to keep itself sustained. (Through blood codes and gifts)Music is hit or miss, some tracks are freaking awesome but others are forgettable (The music in Home Base is awesome though).All in all its a worth it game, and I am keen to keep on playing it. P.S: Character creator is the best compared to any Anime games I've ever tried!			"
Recommended,22.7,"																The character customization is the hardest part of this game *just kidding*, there was so many choices to create your character. The visuals are so gorgeous but the gameplay is slightly difficult cuz of the DarkSouls concept, the voice acts and the animations are also good just like the God Eater *of course also created by Bandai Namco* .

Not Recommended,8.8,"																A game that desperately tries to be anime Dark Souls but without the budget or the talent. Filled to the brim with fan service that screams ""we would rather be making a porn game"", absolutely trite writing and unlovable characters, with a side dish of asset reuse, both when it comes to enemies and levels. Most of the difficulty in this game is artificial or the product of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ coding, regular enemies are braindead and will will freeze in place whenever they try to target your AI teammate, enviromental hazards only affect the player (they don't even affect your AI teammate) and whenever you face an enemy (usually a boss) that poses any difficulty it won't be because of its smart coding or careful balance, it will be because of one of several possible reasons:* They either can attack faster than your stamina regenerates. * They have wide area attacks that cover 80% of the available space around them.* Their attacks have very little tell, or misleading telegraphing.* They have swings that have buggy hurtboxes* They have attacks that affect an area bigger than what you can roll away from* They have invincibility periods where they either take 0 damage  or close to none.This game's idea of increasing difficulty is to throw more and more of the most annoying or unfair enemies at you, to the point that you get hit by an offscreen projectile that takes 70% of your health when you're busy already dodging really fast attacks, because some other enemy AI switched from targetting your AI partner to you for no reason.You will ocassionally get stuck between two sources of damage and then take 100% of your health as damage without being able to do anything.Don't expect MP to help either, it doesn't seem to have anyone playing, so you'll either have to convince someone to buy this garbage or gift it to them.The one interesting aspect of the game which is the gift system used to mix and match skills that you want to use in combat is partially marred by the fact that you have to sit through the insufferable side characters' stories' cutscenes to unlock some skills. Even if you skip them, the whole process is annoying.Even if I look at it like just an anime action game and not a ""Souls-like"", it's still insanely insipid and generic, hardly worth wasting your time or money on it.By the way, if you want to play this on Linux / Steam Deck, it runs mostly ok on Proton, but expect massive temporary framedrops when loading into a new area, or when one of the few large areas that don't reuse the same 5 textures over and over needs to load a different part of it. Also expect rare multisecond long freezes as the game decides to do some processing.			"

Recommended,15.8,"																It's an anime Souls game with an actual, serviceable story, impressive character customization, solid combat, and a fun class system with plenty of non-standard build customization that doesn't revolve entirely around boring stats.It has the usual frustrating aspects you expect from a Souls game, including a few probably unintentional mechanics and interactions, but overall a fun and very refreshing experience. This is coming from someone who has thousands of hours split on PC and console in the main Souls games (not that Surge or Lords of the Constant Earthquake ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and has been burnt out on them for a long time.As a side note, I got this game for free during the Steam races, not as a gift or for review. I was planning to pay full price if I hadn't and wouldn't have regretted a cent of it.			"
Recommended,143.8,"																Pro's1. Good Graphic.2. Good Character Models. (To those crying over it, ""It's a game, It's Fan Service, Get over it."" and drink some Soy milk cause it is really pathetic.)3. Good Story (So far from what I have seen.)4. Somewhat good Voice Acting. (I think it suits the game, however it lacks energy in their voices here and there.4. Music (Some of the Tracks or if not all are well made and are very good, however one music is overly used for the same part.)5. Easy Controls. (I only had to make one change rather then the normal Two or Three from what Namco does some times. Only thing I changed was from the Right Shift to Left Ctrl for more ease of access.Con's1. Some minor bugs. (I'll get into it soon.)2. Is heeding the cry babies over a little fan service due to their DLC's, Which is both stupid in a way since you already have it in the game -_-HEY NAMCO STOP HEEDING THE ""REEE"" FROM THE CRY BABIES WHO SCREECH OVER EVERYTHING FOR CLICK AND COMMENTS AND GROW A PAIR!Stop with the silly censorship. This is not ""China"" and the cry babies are the just a few people who rather cry wolf then buy and play the game.Problems.1. Crash on Starting game. (Now I found a way to get past it, it is to have steam open and active as you look around in the Library and to give out a more clearer info, I use a 1080Ti, it's been more apparent the problem is within GTX 1080 series to ""Launch"" the game (However I do not really think this could be the case as the game Runs GREAT on 1080 with no frame loss on all high settings.) So I hope that this helps those crashing on Launch.2. Exchange Bug. I notice that when you give 2 or more Exchanges to a character it will cause a double (And increases per exchange you give.) need to back out. However if you go into a shop or go into Receive exchange, you will become bugged and will be unable to close the menu as there is no override to escape from this bug. ( This is the reason why I held back on doing my review so I can duplicate this bug and find a way to avoid and know how it was caused. so again. Giving 2 exchanges or more will cause a back out bug that if you do not right click until you no longer hear the backing out noise before going into shops or receiving Exchange, you will be stuck and unable to back out of that menu and will need to restart the game. (This will also cause you to lose your save of what you've done since you only save when Resting at a plant.)Verdict - 7/10Reason behind the missing 3 points is due to how easy these bugs could of been avoided and the lack of QA to ensure that 1080 users or just other users having crashes on Startup when the game will open up it's launcher Image and then goes into the blackscreen and then just close. (Look for my Workaround in Bug 1 to try and work around it. I use two screens.)I do recommend this game, however just giving a warning there are some problems within this game that will just frustrate you.however I am only aware of these two bugs.Lastly the problem is Bandai Namco it self for not doing a proper QA, as it seems they would rather cut the QA testers to avoid paying people to test their games to make sure there no problems, and instead rely on the generous Customers who buy the game at full price to be their QA, so pretty much ""We are paying to QA for them"" which is devious and just downright shameful it is a disrespect to it's consumer base.

Recommended,489.7,"																I don't do reviews but i feel like people aren't giving this game the justice it deserves. Is this game casual compared to dark souls? Yes very much more casual its not as hard as most of the other soul like games however there is still always some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things that happen i swear to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ god the amount of times i have died by trying to run past something and getting 5 different mobs pushing me into a corner and doing very hurtful stuff to me.Is the map design good? i would say it's decent. its not fantastic but i do like them but they could of made some maps bigger in my opinion like the snow map is way to short you can run through that map in near like 20 minutes.Is the story good? i mean its okay. compared to dark souls where u don't really understand what the ♥♥♥♥ the story is i would say it's better. (yes i know what the story behind the dark souls game are about its just more complicated to understand.) the thing i see with code vein is this can be the next god eater series for them. it gives off the god eater story but with different enemies and what you are if that makes sense.How is the combat is it good? yes i would say so in fact! i have seen people complaining about how you cant customize your stats and you are force given a build that's true and wrong. Yes you are locked out from customizing your BASE stats as they do it for you how ever just because you use a certain code doesn't mean you cant mix match it. i have done 2 runs through this game now one as full melee and another as magic melee. now doing just melee i went the prometheus blood code which is about enhancing your dex stat to use certain weapons better (one handed) in that blood code are certain skills/passive skills you can gain. now if you awake those passive skills you can equip those on ANY other blood code. at first i didn't really attempt to use this system as i saw no problem with my full melee build. however my second run i really wanted to run a magic/one handed build. i used the isis blood code but mixed and matched it with some passive skills from other blood codes to allow me to deal high magic damage and melee damage at the same time with allowing me to use 2 handed weapons if i wanted. this game is built around mix matching your blood code to give u a play style not your stats.Online Co-op is it good? hell yes honestly just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ always use someone to do the work for you cause why not. there are some bug issues that can happen such as soft locking you out if someone joins your game as you are trying to open a door it will just get stuck and your ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Optimized? compared to the beta. much more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimized but the game does still have minor frame drops. usually  when entering a new areaCharacter Customization is it good? um there is like 200 different eyebrow options you are going to be able to make the character you want i am sure. on the other note i would of liked more outfits but yes the customization is really good.Is the Soundtrack good? yes i actually really love this games soundtrack its really good i man for ♥♥♥♥ sake's its Go Shiina he helped make Kimetsu no yaiba's (Demon slayer for you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plebs who don't know the Japanese name for the anime) sound track so its really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.Are the Graphics good? i mean its unreal engine 4 shell shaded anime graphics so its pretty good.Are the Effects good? Now if i saw correctly in the credits. Ufotable did the effects for this game and that explains why because the effects look pretty damn good. also for people who don't know what ufotable has done if you have ever seen any of the Fate series then all that cool looking effects that's them or lets say you have not seen any fate series well have you seen Demon slayer or at least that episode 19 where everyone was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jizzing out on. yep they also did the effects for that.Should you buy this at full price? i would say wait a bit let them fix some of the issues first so you don't have to go through them but other then that i would recommend buying this game even at full price.i honestly don't know what else to write about as its about 2 am as i'm writing this so i may edit this in the future but that's what i could think of as of the moment so enjoy it			"
Recommended,64.9,"																Incredible game, as somebody who didn't come from a Souls-like background this was surprisingly easy to get into whilst still maintaining a level of complexity so that it wasn't dull and boring. The characters, whilst not too expanded on are likeable and have interesting personalities, except Yakumo, who has the generic ""friendship will prevail"" stereotype that has been beaten to death.The story, while not too complex is interesting and easy to understand.The ability and leveling system is great and allows for you to create almost any kind of playstyle you wish within the boundaries of what is allowed.

Recommended,37.6,"																Remember to always press your own boobs to restore your health!Code Vein is a really unique souls-like game while still keeping the traditional JRPG-ish characters and plot.That's what makes this game so special, also as like other reviewers already said the character customization  in this game are a top notch.For the gameplay i found really satisfying in terms of skill and combat but it can be tiring for sometime because you will be more focusing to unlock more skills unless you only want to focus or make specific-only build (i.e. World of STR build). The Difficulty of the game itself it's pretty fair, not too difficult but not too easy either but it can go spike of all of sudden especially in some boss battles if you don't really prepared so be careful with that. Kinda like most Shin Megami Tensei titles if you're familiar with it.The partners in this game are really helpful and it's always nice to have them while you're exploring the dungeon and they have their own unique skill depending on their build. But If you want to go solo and challenging more of yourself the go for it!  My 2nd playthrough was playing on solo and i guarantee defeating bosses on solo is more satisfying than playing with partners.So should you buy this game? YES!And make your own dream waifu!!!This game could be nice introduction to bring some newcomers for more liking souls-like genre in the future, i really hope so...PS: Mia Best waifu, Yakumo best Husbando :).

Recommended,20.6,"																 Disclaimer: This review was written purely from a casual single play through point of view. At first glance, Code Vein seems like an edgy game for all you anime weaboos out there which it kind of is; however, this game offers so much more than what it looks like. I decided to try out this game because you can't ""judge a book by its cover"" and boy am I glad I played it. The character customization is probably the most impressive Anime style character creations I've ever seen. You're able to put hair extensions on your avatar which really helps you with the idea that you are actually creating your very own anime character. One thing i didn't like about the character creation was the lack of clothing variety and the fact that there's a limit to how many attachments you could put on, Including hair extensions.Moving on to the game itself, The game has an amazing soundtrack and does a really good job of creating a nice atmosphere for each region with the exception of two dungeons. The game does however lack in enemy variety and it does fall victim to ""re-skinned"" enemies with minor changes. The most enjoyable thing about this game is its cast of characters. I got to learn the backstory of each of the characters and the more I got to know them the more attached I got to them. At times the lip sync or audio felt a bit off even when the characters were wearing their respirator masks. The world is pretty generic and the game itself knows that which is why the game focuses more on the actual characters than the actual game world. Now lets get to the gameplay, like what everyone has said before this game is basically ""anime dark souls"". The only thing unique about it is the companion system where you can always have an NPC character aid you on your game run. Note that the online co-op only allows for 1 person to help you on your journey so don't expect to play this game with a group of friends. More like, with A friend. Some of the back-stab animations took up too much time and it would actually be easier to just walk up to an enemy in spam the light attack on his rear. Sometimes the back-stab animation would bug out and i would be doing multiple back-stab ""jabs"" and sometimes i wouldn't get back stabs at all. Also parrying only worked on some mini bosses/bosses and only prevented you from taking damage most of the time. The Blood Code Class system was very enjoyable. Unlike Dark Souls. You can take multiple paths and it wont punish you for not making a mage style build. Being able to deal tons of damage with magic while holding a giant sword never felt better.The Multiplayer : The game pretty much gang bangs you the entire way so if you want a game that is very challenging for a single player play through this is it my friend. Multiplayer also may affect your personal thoughts on the game as well. For example, I didn't get to save some of the character's because i was unable to do things due to online play. This game has multiple endings depending on what you do. A helpful reminder. Multiplayer may prevent you from activating certain events which prevents you from obtaining the ending you desire, so be on the look out for that. . The gestures and voice lines make online play much more enjoyable because it let's you interact with others online. It's not revolutionary or anything, but it adds a certain charm to the game as a whole.There are many things good and bad about Code Vein and here they are : The Good: Characters,Story TellingThe FeelsMusic Classes, Spells,Classes/Blood Codes, Waifus The Bad : Cringey MomentsFriendship destroys all evil cliqueOverZelous ""Japanese"" talking gesturesAudio SyncJanky Running Animation Nip Picks :  Traps in places design to hit youLimited Usable itemsUseless Usable ItemsHiding enemies every room you go toThe Cathedral(s)Clipping of Hair/Clothing2 Handed Sword MetaFinal thoughts :Code Vein is a game about what it means to show compassion to others. It reminds us that even though you or the people close to you are suffering, we all share that pain and sometimes the only way to get through rough times is being surround by those who care about you... I mean, unless you get the true ending. Please god get the true ending. Don't be like me and feel nothing but despair and sadness inside.			"
Recommended,8.4,"																Excellent well rounded soulsborne with a twist or two up its sleeve!I have roughly 700+ hours across Souls games in consoles, and this falls right up there as one of the most interesting.Pros:- Character customization is literally insane (spent roughly 2 hours making different variations from male to female and still feel theres so much more tweaking i can do).- Awesome backstab animations, and exciting weapon system.- For once an interesting home base and world.- Intriguing story, actual cutscenes that build on it.- Character ally AI adds an interesting dynamic to how you approach each fight.- Overall decently tight combat with the usual take your time and be rewarded vs rush in and get nailed to a wall.- Interesting customization system highly built around weapons.- Interesting enemy themes up to my point in the game.- Stamina system is done right with variables on dodges, weapon size, etc. (I imagine this only gets more in depth as you keep going)- Anything from straight melee, to guns, to magic - lots of options with unlockable blood codes that boost and hinder depending. Cons:- Ultrawide screens were not supported without using a hex editor which seems so foolish can you can see where they just cut things off. - Still haven't figured out how to switch enemies seamlessly via M+KB, not quite as tight as Dark Souls controls.- Framerate can sometimes act janky even with a high end rig like mine (a random frame stutter shows they need to optimize more)- Doesn't necessarily hand hold into the controls which can be both a pro for souls veterans like me, or a negative for new folks.- Graphics I guess could be better in this day in age, especially for a easy to render anime style game.Overall: I recommend this for anyone who enjoys Souls, wants a couple new twists and challenges, as well as an environment that isnt necessarily just gray. There are some cool new features to the way Bandai Namco is tackling the ""souls"" genre.			"
Recommended,2.1,"																First of all - if you are looking for second Nier:Automata, like I was, that's not it. Absolutely not it.On the other hand if you are Souls fan and also happen to like anime, it is definitelly the stuff you would welcome.Gameplay is pretty close to souls, storytelling though is pretty open and not cryptic. Character creation got really lots of options, except for inability to change heigh, physique and for some reason eye shape? I mean come on, you only have around 6 variants that are locked to the type of face you chose... That's really weird. And face types are also few.			"

Recommended,25.2,"																Piece of garbage with good looking anime characters and bugs. Souls like game what noone will play in multiplayer. Story is kinda boring. Was expected better			"
Not Recommended,30,"																 Playing the Game Take your time If you have a breakneck-based game library with games like pvp CoD, R6, and battle royale genres then this game is almost certainly not for you. This is a third person souls-game and as such it requires you to progress through the game by learning all enemy mechanics; the only way to do that is by slowly moving through levels killing enemy mobs (or being killed by those mobs). Eventually you'll memorize their attacks and timing and at the same time, you'll find your favorite classes and weapon combinations all while going through a surprisingly decent story, as cheesy as it may be. Its a JRPG what do you want from me.Scaling and the Loading ScreenIt is completely useless for its named value because nothing actually 'scales' the way it should.  ""No it doesn't boost damage like the loading screen says it does, unless you think that a +39 damage on a weapon that deals 69,420 damage is a huge improvement.""[/b] The only *real* reason you'd need to even understand what it is, is for the stat requirements for your weapons and armor. ""Weapon 'A' needs a strength of 'B+' to wield effectively, so if you don't meet the weapon's par then get another weapon or increase the base strength somehow.""If you listen to the loading screen for that sweet seductive DPS BONUS VALUE then you're buying a farm right before the stock market crashes. Or you decided to click on that ad on pórnhub and actually put your credit card info in. Or maybe you thought getting AIDS was a good idea for some reason. Point is, don't listen to the loading screen info, it'll drive you mad. Conclusion  Pretty good game all in all but plays best with a friend (although its really confusing at first as to how it works, check  here [codevein.wiki.fextralife.com]). There are 3 endings, a good, a sad, and a bad and I'll let you figure out how those work if you actually play the game but I seriously recommend looking up a lot of the stuff for it as the game sure as hell won't tell you why things work the way they do.

Recommended,40.9,"																This is a soulslike clone in so many ways, but thats not a bad thing. This game took a more direct approach to the storytelling by telling the story through the memories your character picks up. The story overall was pretty interesting and is certainly easy to follow unlike soulslike games. The combat was about right, though some enemies i felt were a bit unfair with their timings. This said, the blood codes were an interesting approach to classes and the weapons were pretty interesting as well. Overall its a different enough game, it deviated enough from the souls series to differentiate itself. I would give it a 7 out of 10, its different, but you still know what kind of game you are getting into.			"
Recommended,27.8,"																Dark Souls + Anime = Amazing!I give this game a 8/10 its fun and has a good story and is challenging but can be frustrating some times!but still that's no reason to give up once you beat a boss or finish the game its extremely satisfying!I highly recommend this for someone looking for a good game with challenging Gameplay and most importantly Anime!Note: Don't get the DLC's there not good only the base game!

Recommended,411.1,"																Honestly, anyone who sees this review will be able to tell I've played this game... a LOT. I feel like after reading other comments, I have some pretty unpopular opinions about this game compared to the community. I honestly, loved it. I really, really liked it. Perhaps its because I'm a fan of Skyrim, the entire Sims franchise, and anime, but honestly, this game was a perfect escape from reality. I think the thing about games is how subjective they can be, and what people look for in a game that determines whether they like it or not. I love having a large selection of customization to the point where I don't feel I need to add CC and I can have the most outrageous character in game. I love being able to make a character and having that character be thrown into the main plot-line. It was fun trying to discover the story-line and allowing the secrets to unfold. I had no expectations of what the story would become, so therefore, I enjoyed it for what it was. I enjoyed the cut-scenes thoroughly and felt like I was watching an anime in which my oc was the main character. Perhaps I am just a horrible gamer, but I found the bosses and the enemies to be extremely difficult to defeat. I would die over and over again until i figured out a tactic that worked. However, i had to change my strategy various times. I found all locations fun to explore and challenging in their own ways. Maybe I am easily entertained, but in general I think this was a great game. This is an amazing game for someone who likes dramatic plot-lines, being the main character, long games, single-player (co-op has issues), character customization, and anime. My biggest complaint is how the endings, well, ended. Nothing felt wrapped up, so I want more. I'd like a sequel to find out what happens next. I hope this helps someone!			"

Recommended,53.3,"																TL;DR: Even with its flaws, this game was a great experience. If you want to buy the Deluxe Version, get it on sale. While this is heavily similar to Dark Souls, this game still has it own gameplay quirks to the point that you can't just pass this up as a simple weeb DS clone. And, for the most part, I think they've done alright modifying the DS formula. Story can be better though.Story (7/10):The story is not exactly what you can call superb, but its not bad either. At the very least, it's an ""interesting meh"" to me. Probably not something that can make you get hooked, but the lore kinda makes up for it. It's kinda sad since I actually liked the setting (and found out that it's from God Eater too). I also liked the vestiges (all done ala Fallout 4's Memory Den style), since it gives the side characters a backstory and really fleshes out the characters that don't really have the time to be in the spotlight.But too bad! The main story is a generic shounen anime story. Specially in the parts near the end, it's mostly cheesy ""the power of friendship"" shtick that you can get from a usual JRPG/Anime. It's hard to take the story seriously after that. Since for every major boss after the first half of the game has the ""friendship"" line or something to that effect. Don't get me wrong, I don't think the ""power of friendship"" is a bad thing. Having one or two speeches about it is fine. But here, holy hell, tone it down! The power of friendship in this game is so strong that you're even all buddy-buddy with the person who stabbed you to death!Gameplay (8/10):I think this is where the game shined for me. It's far from perfect, but enough to get me hooked. One of the pros of this are Blood Codes that you can swap on the fly. Blood Codes are like a class system in the game and this is one of the game mechanics that separates the game from a just another DS clone. Each Code gives you enough variety of skills for a specific build. But, if you master those said skills, you can use them on other Codes so you can mix and match them for experimentation.Other pros of this are the QoL additions. Sure, true hardcore DS fans might not want some of these, but I welcome the addition for casual play. One of these of having a minimap. Something that you would REALLY need if you're going through the Cathedral. In fact, they probably added the minimap because of that damn dungeon.Next pro is having a partner to follow you. Which is both a pro and a con depending on your playstyle.If you're going to play casually (and chances are, a first timer on a souls game), the partner system is probably a god send to you. This makes the game significantly easier since you have a partner to fight with you. It's a nice contrast against DS' lonely atmosphere. Gameplay-wise, they're great for having multiple enemies at the same time. As they can distract other enemies while you focus on one, and they will be able to revive you in the nick of time if you've ever managed to f**k up. But even with that, still expect dying a crapton though. Bosses are designed with partners in mind. So they're still pretty hard even though you have a partner by your side. I actually liked the partner system since your partner's AI is pretty competent for the most part. My only gripe about it is that they won't shut up and keeps stating the obvious. The devs probably know about this since there is actually a toggle in the options to shut your partner's mouth.If you're playing hardcore, the fun of actually caring about your decisions is kinda lost here.  With the perks that I've described above, engaging enemies won't be as scary as fighting solo. So this is probably not something what you'd want if you're looking for pure DS gameplay. But partners are entirely optional and the game can still be finished without them.Now back to the gameplay cons. This con is more of a pet peeve for me than an actual con. And that is the really floaty movement of your character. The movement's alright and responsive but it just doesn't feel right. Their movement doesn't really feel grounded, and feels like your character do not have any weight in its movements. And lastly, is the map design. It's really bland in my opinion, but there are exceptions, particularly the Cathedral.Music (7/10):Eh. To be honest, there aren't much memorable pieces in this game. They are good, but not ""I wanna listen to it again on loop on Youtube"" good. I liked the vestige music tho.Graphics (8/10):It's really great. Art style is pretty great. It flows pretty well with the apocalyptic setting. Only complaint I have is the saturated colors. The saturation is great for the anime aesthetic, but I wish they toned it down to emphasize the bleakness of the world. Case-in-point, Dark Souls' color scheme. But this is just my opinion and in no way changes my rating for the graphics. Anyway, about the Character Designs. They sure make it pretty obvious which demographic they are targeting. First five minutes after the tutorial is your eyes to be sucked towards Io's... uh... Eyes. For such an apocalyptic scenario, the whole cast looks pretty fresh. But, I'm not complaining tho. I didn't start up the game expecting ultra realistic character designs.			"
Recommended,48,"																First of all, it's anime, so -10/10. Level design is pretty contradictory, I'd say it's very stupid and has a lot of unnecessary labyrinths. I wanted to fight some bosses and listen for a good music (music and other sfx is majestic and wonderful, so 10/10)! It's even worse than in ds1, cuz despite having awful level design, there is no labyrinths in ds1. This game is souls-like, not a hecking pac-man or some other kind of maze game... 0/10.But exploration of game world is interesting, I enjoyed that (except for the last location and fake Anor Londo where I wasted in general 6 hours)...Graphics it's not that good. I mean it's really bad in comparison to other games of that year, but it doesn't make your eyes feel pain. It's just like anime: it's ♥♥♥♥, but nobody cares. This is much better than cyberpoop 2007 I should say. So 7/10Gameplay... YEs, there are fights besides of walking arond the whole game globe. And that's not fun at all. There are 2 types of souls-likes: 1) Having good fighting controls (triggers and buttons for forefingers); 2) Having awful X Y buttons controls just like in slashers (yeah, it's good only for slashers and this game is terrible both as slasher and as souls-like). I mean I can recommend you to download some trainers and make your game experience much better (no worries, even at level 300 you still able to suck some wieners). Let's forget about terrible controlls and try to rate fightings. Yeah, 85% of the game is good in this term. Most of mobs and bosses are verrry interesting to fight.... That's all except for 2 bosses: one bi7ch with a stick spamming you with tornados and toxins (it not a bossfight, it's just very annoying attempt to heal that fricking toxin and not to die by dodging spam attacks) aaaaand The Virgin Born.... Right before him you have a battle with Skull King and it's very hard(in comparison to all others) and enjoyful boss. But the Virgin is a hecking attempt to make almost unbeatable Moon Presence. At the very ending developers decided to spit in your face by giving you a fatass monster with spamming attacks hitting like a truck (It deals damage to almost a third of my health at 1st phase AND I HAVE lvl300 character with fattest blood code and passive ability for having more health.) Almost all of its attacks are unavoidable: you are at long range? Get a fricking crystall burst just like from Gatling (remember, one crystal -1/3 of your health); you are at mid range or standing in front of its face? It's gonna spam slaps just like Obelix slapping roman warrior. You are underneath it? Virgin gonna aoe the frick out of you. You can't outrun, you can't dodge, you can't hide from aoe attack. Yeah. Good luck having enough heals for 2nd phase (there are 10 estus, 3 estus-like heals, but rare and only 1 divine blessing.) Even when you are newbie at ds3, when you fight Gael, it's possible to have even half of your heals at the end of bossfight. But not in Code Vein. You are gonna be very lucky to have few heals for phase 2 when boss at 3/4 of his health starts to fly upwards and begin nuclear bombardment for literally the whole arena with crystals. Every crystall has its own huge aoe and there are billions of them eating half of your hp per hit. Good luck fighting with that piece of crap showing us that developers are morons. Only this bossfight made me having a bad mood after that game. But you know what? Frick it, I recommend you to play. 6/10. You can always foget about that game right after killing Skull King.Views:Yep, those are good as heck. You'll never be disappointed.Game in general 6/10Upd: I'm done with DLCs, so now I'm very pleased of that game. 12/10 That's better than ds1 and ds3. This game is ds2 tier			"

Recommended,102.5,"																A solid souls-like game, and definitely worth playing. The story is hokey at best, but the gameplay is extremely solid - I found myself coming back to this game again and again, wanting more of the tight, ""risk-reward"" combat. You can play as a tank, guarding and moving slowly... But something about flying around the battlefield as a blur of 1-handed swords and fireballs is too appealing in my eyes.Also, the character creator is incredible, and takes me back to designing my own characters in the Soul Calibur series, without having to pay outrageous fees for a set of pauldrons.

Recommended,41.3,"																I have preordered Code Vein and have had it for one third of a year now. I didn't once regret buying it.Code Vein features an amazing cast of well written characters (who accompany you on your journey), an immersive story with 3 different endings and a beautiful world to play in. You can customize your playstyle with 5 different kinds of weapons and over 30 classes (blood codes) with each of them posessing from 4 up to 10 personal skills which you can master, to use them with other classes. My personal favourite about this game is the wide array of customization it offers. I spent at least 30 - 40 hours, playing around with the way my characters look, even changing them after bossfights and parts of the story. And the game has gotten even more accessoires on holidays and halloween, so I'm not quite sure that I've seen all of it.Personally I haven't encountered any bugs or issues with Code Vein but if there is a bad side about it, then it's the multiplayer feature. You can ""summon"" another Person in a level where you haven't beaten the Boss and if the player who ""summoned"" the other Person dies, the second player gets disconnected, which also happens when you kill the levels Boss. This isn't a bug or a glitch, but a design flaw which I think the developers can work on.I hope my review of Code Vein has given you an idea of what it's like and I highly recommend you buy it to feel how awesome it is by yourself. Good day!			"

If you're into God Eater, Lords of the Fallen or Dark Souls 3 (because dark souls 3 is the easiest lul), I highly recommend this game.  A bit of a warning, kind of cringe anime stuff and booby models so if you're not into that then... eh.Overall I'd say 9.5/10 a solid RPG, 10/10 if they'd fix the multiplayer stuff.			"
Recommended,15.6,"																Coming in from the dark souls franchise, I have to say I really enjoyed this game. While it may not be as graphically polished as dark souls 3, it really does hit home with the anime factor. The combat is really fun, the magic is challenging to use the weapon animations are so anime it's great.I'd say I only have 2 complaints: The first is that there are TOO MANY CUTSCENES! I mean, seriously. Way. Too. Many.The second is that, being a heavy weapon guy, I immediately went for a 2-handed sword and the way the character swings it makes it seem like it's made of cardboard. It's like this massive sword doesn't have any weight. A bit nit-picky I guess..Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this game!			"
Recommended,76.8,"																10/10.I would call this game underrated (at least compared to the likes of Dark Souls) but I'm glad to see that it's been really picking up traction within the mainstream gaming community recently. With solid Souls-like gameplay, a myriad of character customisation options and an engaging, heartrending story (the last one being the one thing that I've found to be majorly lacking in the Souls games), CODE VEIN is truly an amazing gem and my personal GOTY. It certainly has its flaws (occasional clunkiness and bugs being one of my biggest gripes), but overall, this is certainly a game worth playing if you enjoy Souls-likes or even just difficult games in general, really.Give CODE VEIN a try.

Similar to the souls franchise the game takes place far into the future. You a vampire (Revanant) must gather bloodbeads along with your companions to survive. You can bring one ai coop partner and fire a flare/signal to summon out a random online person.Beware because simlar to NIOH the online person is likely overleveled and can probably one tap the boss or do insane amounts of damage to it. Enemy variety is plentiful. The types of enemies in each zone usually are about 5 or more different enemy types you fight. Each enemy behanves differently depending on what you do (if you attack at range the enemies will sidestep if you go in for melee they might block etc.)Overall the game is awesome my biggest concern is the playerbase. As it stands there are about a thousand or so people playing it daily. I would encourage you and others to buy this game. the multiplayer aspect is fun but it needs more people.			"

Recommended,493,"																Right, let's get the Dark Souls comparison outta the way:~Bonfire style revive system with Haze (souls) dropped on Death~Diverse weapons and classes to make your own custom character~Stamina Management and limited healing~You're basically assured victory in a 1v1 fight if you're not a friggin idiot about it~Epic soundtrack that gets you pumpedNow for what it does differently~Aesthetic, obviously. It is VERY anime.~The story is more in your face than the deliberately vague Dark Souls (This is neither a good nor bad thing necessarily, just different)~No respec system. Instead, swap your class and build on the fly.~Character creation: The most robust thing I've ever seen in character creation. Want a hat on your dong? You can have a hat on your dong. Want to hang a ribbon from your arm? You can do that. Want to have a ponytail sticking out of a rice cake that you have on top of a hat that you have attached to your left shoulder? Go nuts.Now that the comparison is out of the way, the question of ""Is it good"" comes up. I would say it is. In a world of Soulslikes aping the formula, CV goes to the effort of making sure it has an identity. A final note: If you don't want to deal with the AI companions, you can tell them, in the home base, to stay home. The game is solo'able. Harder, of course. The game was designed with you having a buddy in mind, so solo is definitely harder. But it can be done.			"

Recommended,38.5,"																The game is well polish for its release just 4 days of being out. Yes, there is bugs and issues with the game that come cross pretty early. It does provide a story that can mess with you pretty well, if you are willing to hunt it down. I would say it worth the 60 dollars as an upfront cost. What makes this game worth the 60 dollars? If you enjoy a more anime style of visuals then its a good fit for that. The character creation is well done for what it provides a good example is having hats on your characters chest. The bosses feel well tune for the fights to provide enough of a challenge to the player. The models themselves look wonderful to look at. The characters themselves are nice and do show how the grow as the player does. The Blood codes (classes) feel interesting to build around and mix and match also has your playing dress up expect with gifts (powers). What could be improve with the game? The game could use a better handling with some of the animations regarding the clipping of hair. The soundtrack is wonderful to listen to expect when it comes to most boss fights you do it will repeat the same song. The story is good to certain degree the intro of the game could be explored a lot better or expressed in a more detail. This story thought could be from the lack of lore I found on my play through.  What makes this game bad and needs major improvements? The common enemies you find scattered around the maps are very easy to deal with and didn't give the feeling of not needing to be careful until later in the game. Final thoughts are this game is worth the time and energy to play if you like anime style visuals, a good character creation, creative builds, and pleasing to look at characters. Would I recommend this to a friend or a complete stranger? Yes, for the reasons above and for its current price again yes I would recommend to a friend. As time of this review I have not tested the games multiplayer function enough to give a solid rating on. Thank you for reading this review have a good day.			"

The game has a kinda hidden difficulty slider called AI co-op. You are able to take a AI with you through the game this will make the game easy if you have played any soul like game before. I highly recommend that you play solo if you are finding the game easy it becomes a lot harder and makes you plan out your choices. i would say this game is a good 8.5 for combat however i will admit the story and enemy variety is not the best so that part gets 6.5.			"
Recommended,32.1,"																GET.THIS.GAME.PUNK.In short, this game has taken the souls formula and made it better. You start by creating your own character and oh boy is this character creation deep. It has so many options, you can spend hours creating your character and after you create your character, guess what, you can actually play with your character unlike in Dark Souls where after character creation you run around as a corpse. This game is hard, but not in a frustrating way. Your character feels strong in this game. Regular enemies don´t kill you in 1 - 2 hits and you can stagger enemies just like they can stagger you, which means when you are being offensive, the enemy doesn´t just hit you through your attack animation. You also got those cool looking anime style flashy attacks that you can use so you don´t have to approach every enemy with your guard up, wait for the enemy to attack you and then counter. You can just go, attack and kill it and be off. Bosses are as challenging as in Dark Souls, but whats better in this game is that ""bon fires"" are closer to boss encounters. So when you die you don´t get frustrated. You can just go back in and fight again. So basically this game doesn´t go the extra mile to piss you off, it just let´s you learn from your mistakes, practice and get better without the additional controller destruction in the middle. This game has a story and not the kind of go figure it out yourself by reading item descriptions, but an actual story and an interesting one at that. You have a group of NPCs in the game with whom you interact and form relationships with. The areas in this game look cool and you also have a map, so it´s so much better to navigate. Multiplayer I haven´t tried yet, but when I play single player then I have an AI companion with me all the time, so that leads me to believe you can have a proper multiplayer game with your friend through the entire game. Not just sections where you can summon and etc. EDIT 2019/11/27: You can´t play with your friend from start to finish without reconnecting as the system is similar to souls game in a way that it has multiplayer ""checkpoints"". Which means if you get to a certain milestone, usually a boss fight, then your session ends. However it´s very easy to reconnect with your friend in this game because you can basically set up a connection between you and your friend so that nobody else can join using a ""password"" system. I´m not going to explain this in detail, but i am gonna say that it is really easy to connect with a friend in this game. 2 handed weapons such as heavy swords and hammers feel too heavy. I was hoping that maybe in this game they swing faster, but they are as slow as they were in Dark Souls, so I don´t use them very much. Leveling up has been simplified as in you just spend your ""souls"" to level up, not raising individual stat points separately and also if you die, you leave your ""souls"" behind that you have to collect, just like in Dark Souls. Character customization is done by switching between different ""jobs"" and learning different skills from different ""jobs"" and combining them. ""Jobs"" also determine which weapons and armor you can use.			"

Recommended,26.9,"																Coming into Code Vein after having completed the Dark souls Trilogy was...interesting.There are a lot of things to like about this game but at the same time there are a lot of things to hate about this game, I'll start with the good ones.As my first souls like experience i tried not to set my expectations too high, i had seen some gameplay, the beautiful screenshots and waifu content but i was still hesitant to expect a souls experience. First im gonna talk about the story and characters and then get into the world/areas, dlc and overall feel about the game.The game's story is pretty good, there are a lot of good and emotional moments, especially with vestiges, the game is filled with them. Lots of nice characters, a few interesting plot twists and a decent flow.  I wouldn't call it a top tier story though, it's pretty standard, you're the protagonist and you're gonna save the world. But even though this is a souls-like, they went a different route when it comes to telling a story, they decided to go the standard AAA route where they feed you 95% of the info which man honestly it's so bad like one of the things i love about dark souls is the ""story telling"" there isn't even any story telling, you put pieces together, there's lots of lore hidden in items/weapons you find and the more you find out about the world around you, you slowly piece stuff together about characters, the world itself and everything in the game etc etc, which i believe makes you so invested in the world instead of just spoon feeding me all the info and leaving a few small mysteries in the air. I wish they had gone the dark souls route on that front, cutscenes are nice but 5 hours of the game or more are cutscenes that spoon feed you info.Sadly for me though my biggest issue with the story was that you didn't end up getting close close with your group of friends that you have at Home Base, i just didn't get attached to most of the characters, some not at all, might be a me issue, even with the vestiges i don't know, i just couldn't get attached to them, my favorite character of the group was Yakumo and i felt like my character got to know him best and was closer to him than anyone else but other than that, the rest of the characters just felt like casual friends, not friends you ride or die with.To get back to the story, it had a few good plot twists that added interest but the world around my character was just... mostly the same. And here i think is where another drawback comes to bite Code Vein in the ass, there was barely any creativity in the area making in this game, 90% of the areas are just caves or caved in areas, which makes it super repetitive to go through an area and you kinda feel the need to speedrun through it because it looks the same. Besides that you have the Anor Londo copy called ""Citadel"" which would be a good area but they decided to make it a labyrinth so never mind i guess way to lose free points there lol, I didn't personally get lost that much or had to watch youtube videos to find my way to stuff but it was still annoying af.Now for the combat, i loved the combat, it was actually super fun, lots of fun spells or as they're called in this game ""Gifts"", that was probably the thing i loved about this game the most, the super fluid combat, you can just combine all sorts of spells from different classes and do all sorts of combo's while also having some buffs and long range attacks, you can mix and match gifts that give your character/build lots of versatility.And since im talking about mix and matching between classes, let's talk about classes, this game has every class you could probably ever ask for, each having unique and interesting spells which if you become ""proficient"" in you can use them in a different class too, there's so much versatility when it comes to builds in this game and you can literally change your build in a minute, from a 1 hand sword with normal speed to a wizard with all sorts of gifts, i love that aspect of this game, It's completely different to dark souls where each time you level up you have to choose between all sorts of stats so you have to choose a specific build from the start, because you can't just swap out your Blood veil and suddenly be a mage if you've leved up strength etc etc, love that about this game, big props to the devs for the awesome combat and class systems. Nothing but greatness. Also loved the backstab/parry animations/cinematics, very satisfying.Moving onto enemies, don't have a lot to say here, there were a lot of interesting enemies that spiced up the gameplay, +1 on that front, only thing to complain about here is how often you'd see enemies get re-used, sometimes you'll move onto a new area and you'll be happy to see new enemies until you come accross a couple of the same enemies you first saw 4 areas ago and they just decided to put them there cuz why not i guess, shouldn't have done that at all and just kept it fresh with each area. That wasn't super bad though.Bosses. B o s s e s, bosses are generally one of the most challenging and fun part of a souls/soulslike and after having played the dark souls trilogy i've experienced all types of bosses, so i kinda expected that code vein would hit a sweet spot in that aspect with me, sadly it didn't, the bosses were mostly complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, after the first couple of bosses the devs decided to make it so that 1 mistake can cost you your entire health bar, too much damage man just too much, considering how slow healing is combined with how fast their combo's are, starting with the Gilded Hunter, god what an utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss design, the boss can power up 50 thousand times, you can't cancel the power up FOR SOME REASON the devs decided that was fair, in one of my tries he powered up like 4 or 5 times. But yeah anyway not much else to say about the bosses, after one point in the game the devs cranked up the numbers way too much, no one likes getting one shot, it makes you feel like upgrading your veil or getting more defense does absolutely nothing? tl;dr with the bosses: Too many power ups, they deal way too much damage and thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ considering how slow u heal, good luck getting that perfect timing otherwise you're gonna get hit while healing. The boss fights i enjoyed the most are: Insatiable Despot, The Queen's Knight, Successor of the Ribcage, Successor of the Breath and Hellfire Knight. Last thing to talk about are the DLC's, god the DLC's were an absolute disaster, all RE-USED enemies from the normal game,absolutely shameless that they make you pay anything for the DLC's of this game, they should've been free thats how bad they are, the areas are super whatever and small af, clearly the DLC's are just a quick way to make a quick buck because people expect new content, the only new thing in the DLC's are the final bosses, the big 3 titans that are omega tanky and very challenging, i loved the Hellfire Knight, the Frozen Empress was a bit odd and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but kinda whatever and the Lord of Thunder is just a copy of the Sanctuary Guardian from Dark Souls 1, just cranked the numbers up a bit and modernized. Re-use from a previous game and re-use from your own game, EVEN the weapons u get as a reward for defeating the big 3 dlc bosses are simply recolours from the original game, the DLC's are an absolute disgrace and should've never existed.Oh yeah this game also has crazy good character customization, you're gonna have a blast creating your favorite waifu or hero or whatever you like really.Overall, would i recommend you to give this game a shot? Sure, go for it, it's a good experience overall, it wasn't a bad a experience for sure, there are a lot of things to complain about but then again every game has things to complain about and it varies from person to person, some stuff that annoyed me that might not even phase you. So yes. give it a shot, it's Anime souls afterall, worth playing for that experience alone. :D			"
Recommended,14.7,"																+ Basically dark souls, but in anime.+ Multitude of classes available which you can change on the fly, with inheritable abilities+ All your steps are traced as dots on the map, allowing you to immediately verify which places you've already checked.+ Innovative way of showing memory flashbacks+ Bunch of waifu candidates+ All the good guys are bros as well- The variety in map design and hazards only starts to kick in when you reach this game's Anor Londo.- Lack of variety in enemies. Later enemies are just reskinned tougher variants that behaves the same way.- Likewise, there's a lack of variety in the available equipment. Once you improve an equipment to max, that's it.- Key items like keys are hidden in the most obscure locations. This becomes a problem in huge confusing areas, like this game's Anor Londo.- Game progression is incredibly lineair. - The game isn't really helpful in guiding you to the right areas in order to progress. This is notable once you reach the point where you have to hunt successors.- There are characters around the world that can provide quests, but they never give you anything worth your trouble.- There are noticeable bugs, but I did not found anything gamebreaking yet, just slightly annoying.I'm not really the right person when it comes to judging whether the story is good or not, so I'm leaving that to other reviewers. Regardless though, I really like the concept, but I feel like only the edges have been touched upon to realize this game. This game is by no means terrible, but I can't recommend this game in face of the flaws it currently has.			"

The items are more difficult to sort through for how to make a build, but there is a combat training area so you will be able to get a feel for a build before going into combat.Con: The player character is silent. Not voiced, no dialogue trees, nothing. A lot of party members and side characters will talk to the protagonist about the situation or their problems, but the protagonist just stares at them blankly. It is very disconcerting and makes it difficult to get invested in anyone's story.			"
Recommended,52.1,"																Finally wrote a review for Code Vein. Long story short, Code Vein is an action role-playing game developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Gameplay is inspired by the Souls like series of games, and the animation is inspired by God Eater.What you should know:-   Great character creation editor, worth of your time to create some good looking character. A lot of options and accessories to choose (limit for accessories has been removed, yeet). Now possible to switch between appearances of created characters midgame.-   Good story, not best but good overall. Includes 4 endings, well actually 3, but anyway they are different and will give you variety of emotions. Those who played God Eater will be pleased too.-   Characters, they are interesting, unique and have a backstory. I also like how we get to know the story of each character and how they develop with the plot.-   Music, and again we see Go Shiina's talent for dramatic melodies and arrangements. A lot of people already know him as composer of God Eater series. For me music was pretty good and it fits perfectly for this game. -   Graphics looks good enough to me, well optimized and polished. I did not experience any issues while playing.-   Gameplay, similar to DS with some differences. Also we have few features similar to God Eater. In time length game takes over 100h+ if you want to complete and see everything. There are variety of possible builds/skills/passives to play with. There are also a few types of weapons like one-handed, two-handed swords, maces, spears, halberds, polearms, two-handed hammers and bayonets. Also a few types of armor, but sadly you can’t customize them (like change color, maybe devs allow this in future).-   Difficulty, probably first run will be the hardest one, as you need to adapt to enemies and learn layout of maps. You also have AI partner, leave him home if you want challenge or play with anyone you like (as Io <3). Also you can summon allies to help you if you get stuck at some battle, personally never did this as game will be too easy to beat. After your first run I suggest switching difficulty to enhanced, leaving your buddy at home and starting NG+, it will be much funnier, even if you already know everything. If you want a real challenge, keep playing at enhanced difficulty and move forward to NG3-4+.-   Locations, as expected from story all locations fits a post-apocalyptic dystopian setting. There are a lot of shortcuts and hidden items. Get ready for Cathedral, it will be fun.-   Enemies and bosses, I wish there was more different enemies with more unique moves and attacks, some bosses are pretty good and fun to play against, others pretty easy to beat.-   Co-op, has a few flaws, but works anyway. Biggest flaw for me – game will be much easier with additional player. Another one – rewards for helping other players. If you helped other player beat whole level and died just before the boss - you gain nothing. It's just one example but reward system need to be changed a little.-   PvP, it doesn’t exist. From story perspective it’s kind of strange, from gameplay perspective I kind of glad that there is no pvp.In general, this game is worth of your time and money. Yes, there are some flaws and things that I would like to add/change, but in any case, I was pretty pleased to play it. If you like DS and want to try something similar, Code Vein is good to do so. Even if you don’t like DS, you may as well just try this game and who knows maybe you will like it. Honestly, this game should be played only because of the character creation editor.And you know, you will fall for Io. No spoilers.			"
Recommended,18.3,"																Code Vein is not a bad game, but it desperately tries to be like Dark Souls, and most certainly fails to do that. You see, soulsborn games are not only about having clunky controls, beating big scary bosses and dying a lot. They are about exploration, mystery, character building and accepting the challenge in form of various enemies. Alas, Code Vein has neither of that.First of all, exploration and level design. All locations are absolutely huge (so you spend a lot of time simply running around), but pretty much linear (even more so than in Nioh) and don't have a lot of secrets to discover. Actually, for secrets the game uses the same trick over and over again: find a spot to drop below, walk on a ledge or through a tunnel, then get up using ladder and discover a valuable item or purify mist (unveils part of the location on the mini-map). The game so desperately and often uses this one trick that it become really cheap after just a few hours. It doesn't have that intricasy and interconnectiveness of Dark Souls locations (among the clones, only The Surge managed to achieve that to a degree), it doesn't even come close to that. And visually locations in Code Vein are also quite bland and boring, though anime stylistic makes them a bit livier than your typical gloomy soulsborn game.Secondly, the mystery. Do you remember reading item descriptions and talking to all characters in DS just for a glimpse of the game lore, because it was interesting? Au contraire, Code Vein has just the opposite. Cutscenes upon cutscenes after cutscenes, long boring dialogues, and too many characters you couldn't care less about (half of those characters have huge boobs, and it doesn't help the story at all).Thirdly, character building. You could argue that Code Vein does this better because you can switch all your stats (blood cores) and abilities (gifts) at any time, completely changing the gameplay experience , but I think it hurts the game, because you just don't feel a connection to your character, can't really make them your own. Besides, all weapons of the same class (one and two hand swords, halberds, bayonettes, and hammers) have the same moveset and differ only visually and a bit in stats. Sure, some weapons have special attacks like creating an ice spikes in front of you, but generally they don't feel too different within each class.So there's little to no discovery, no looking for the weapon that suits your playstyle the best, it all feels the same. Moreover, the difference between quick and slow mobility (roll) is so miniscule it makes much more sense using heavier armors and weapons and blocking than trying to evade attacks which often are completely unexpected and unpredictable.Then, challenges and enemies. 90% of adversaries (including bosses) are humanoids with the same attack patterns and weapons, and compared to bestiary of any From Software game this feels absolutely underwhelming. Only a few bosses are actually fun to fight, the rest are the same as common enemies, just with higher damage and bigger health pools.I also want to mention AI companions that work similar to shades in Dark Souls. While they do help (they can even resurrect the player character!), their vocabulary is very limited, and listening to the same 5-10 different phrases really breaks the immersion. I mean, the game has dozens of cutscenes with tons of dialogues, was it too hard to add more variety to companions' phrases? Hearing ""oh, you have sharp eyes, I didn't see that"" for the hundreds of times when you pick up another item from the ground doesn't make the game better, believe it or not.Last but not least, performance. I have 12900k, 32 GB RAM, 3080Ti, 980 EVO Pro, and the game failed to consistently achieve 120 fps@1440p. Moreover, when playing above 100 fps, there are some bugs (like elevators not working). And even with 60 fps limit it dropped to 55-57 sometimes when streaming in new data. So yep, this proves again that Japanese developers and PC is a bad combination even when they use UE4.Overall, Code Vein feels like a very bland and generic DS clone without bringing anything unique to the board. Again, you might argue about blood cores, but I didn't think it was a good mechanic for the reasons above. Still, you can get the game just to scratch that Dark Souls itch you might have. But even in that case try to get the game on sale and don't buy DLCs: it's just plain grind.			"

"
Recommended,4,"																Code vein is an interesting game. Its has its own approach to the soulslike genre and has lots of customization options regarding character creation, which is one of the reasons a lot of people got to play the game.Overall the game presents you blood codes with skills that you can inherit and use in other bloodcodes to mix and match skills in your build as long as you meet their requirements. Leveling is simplified so you don't manage stats like in darksouls since stats depend of your bloodcode.One of the thigs that make the game more welcoming to new soulslike players is the fact that you can have an IA partner to fight alongside you. He can revive you (with a cooldown) and buff you besides being another target for the enemies. However, you can discharge him if you want. The game also has its own challenge but I still consider it a bit easier than other soulslike games.Storywise the game was pretty good actually. I would have loved a few more things to be clarified but its good enough for what you get. DLCs are more of a tryhard thing since they feature bosses with challenges to get rewards and stuff, weapons and cosmetics are more of a recolor than anything and the dungeons are not that big. HOWEVER, DLCs provide a few more bloodcodes to mess around with. I would recommend getting them on sale since you get more bloodcodes and skills to play with.Overall, a great souslike game that identifies its own style. You have liberty to mix and match skills and weapons. Character customization is quite detailed in some aspects. Friendlier to new players of the genre but still challenging. Buy it on sale and get the DLCs if you want more skills and an extra challenge to aim to after beating the game.			"

Recommended,13.8,"																A very very pretty game that is genuinely awful. Don't even play this if you get it for free, it's just terrible.The designers once watched a trailer for a Dark Souls game, didn't even finish the whole thing and decided they could make a competent game. Surprisingly, they could not.Between hitboxes and animations not matching up even in the slightest and absurd levels of damage and HP on enemies, the game just becomes a tedious slugfest.There is no nuance here, you will just get extremely bored of the repetitive, poorly designed enemies. If you do ever make the extremely poor decision to play this game, save yourself the trouble just load up on a cheap oneshot build or something that gives you the only usable Quick speed dodge - because the iframes of all the other dodges are useless - and brute force your way to the end.But to reiterate, don't play it, not even for free. Not even if someone pays you.			"
Recommended,69,"																Gameplay-wise:+ Complicated system of weapons and skill-set to choose from, though it only allow you to use so few of them at once that most are meaningless.+ A lot of things to collect.- The map got way too complicated starting 1/3 into the game. It sets out a maze just to raise the difficulty in a way that feel like your standard JRPG grind. A lot of mechanism designs in map are meaningless.- The boss difficulty 1/3 of the way onward are ""dark-soul"" difficulty, without alternate easy solutions for casual players like ult and strong debuffs in Nioh, for example. Story-wise:+ Very ""soul-like"" story frame. It offers a grand idea that's interesting.+ Use game mechanism to combine acquiring new code/vestige with characters' narratives through their memory trip.+ Poetic endings.- Story details aren't very good, and cut scenes are pretty meh.- The narrative is not very focused, as a result the theme is unclear.Conclusion:This game has a lot of good things in it, but it also has some flaws that make it not as enjoyable as it could be.

Recommended,47.3,"																Please help, most of my time is in the Character Creator			"
Recommended,28.8,"																I've had to withhold my opinion on the game for quite a while. But I'll try to keep this as short as possible.If you're into branching or deep stories or maybe even into environmental storytelling, you won't find anything that impresses.The DLC isn't terrible as people would lead to believe, but the amount of effort that was put into them is on the low side. I only really recommend them if you A) Love the game and its combat  B) You found the DLC or the Deluxe/Season Pass version for sale.Gameplay-wise, the combat system seems to be quite simple, it is anything but due to some mechanics not being explained and it is up to the player to discover what works and what doesn't. You can play the game by ""bonking"" everything in your path, but it will only get one so far by doing so. I would like to note that there is a lot of customisation, so one may start looking into ""builds"", either made by yourself by being creative, or simply try the existing ones which serve their intended purposes. It is here that the game shines even if there is obvious jank here and there. Just like with anything else, it takes getting used to.Another thing to note on the customisation side of things, is the character creator. It is decent although has a few limits in place, it is enough for the majority of players, but some may find very creative uses for it.This game is challenging enough and may frustrate some players, but it is just all the more rewarding this way. It is just a shame there is no ""real"" incentive to play the game by handicapping your character. (Other than the unexplained mechanic of gaining more ""Gift Mastery"" via enemy dispersal)Co-op features are very welcome, albeit lacking in several departments. Such as no ability to accompany the player in more than just combat areas as a standout example. Due to slower loading times, having either player ""disperse"" means going through a lot of them. The biggest issue is there is no Cross-play with console users due to use of separate ""handshake"" servers, even though the game's networking feature is P2P based (Peer-to-peer) for connectivity. There are some exceptions for MS/Xbox Game Pass players.Music is okay, but is nowhere close to Nier: Automata or FFXIV levels of goodness. It simply works for the tone of the game and that's it I suppose. The regular combat tune will get annoying, fast. Your personal enjoyment may widely vary. (If you feel like playing an even harder game, do what I did, just play your own favourite music and disable game SFX)Game has a photo mode, which includes shaders. Very welcome for people who like making screenshots. It's just a shame you cannot play with the shaders/effects real-time.Modding... It exists, granted, it is still limited, though visual replacements are all over if you prefer eye-candy over what the game gives you.The game has a semi-hidden community of avid players (myself included), both on console and PC, finding them was probably the best thing going into this game if you're into discussing many aspects of the game.Truth be told. I personally found more enjoyment out of this game than the Dark Souls series in one aspect and that is due to how the entire combat system gives you a lot of freedom to play around. But for everything else, there are games that did things much better.PS- SN for Story / CV for Gameplay, 'nuff said.			"

Haze drops are very good to keep up, and the gifts are not that pricey, even upgrading and transforming didn't require much haze.The maps, not that bad, being the only worst backtracking is probably Cathedral, worst environment pain being the Flaming City.The soundtracks?

Your companions pretty much make the whole game a cakewalk, but luckely it's not forced to bring them with you. The story and setting was interesting enough to keep me entertained though, and the artifact system is a nice way to approach the skill and talent points.			"
Recommended,22.6,"																I know this kinda gets bashed over the head as a weaker anime dark souls, but I think it still has some merit in just mindlessly smashing your oversized weeb sword into things faces, story is a bit wishy-washy tbh, it kinda just throws like 20 minute cutscenes in your face to plaster the gaps, overall I think it's a fairly mediocre game, if you're a dark souls fan, you will just absolute trash any boss they throw at you as well, but eh.. I mean I got enjoyment out of it by playing with a friend and watching her walk off cliffs constantly since she has absolutely no sense of her surroundings.			"

Recommended,7.3,"																Honestly i never finished Dark Souls because it felt slow and boss fights where not fun. I never got into it. But i finished Code Vein. Twice.But why?A) Code Vein feels fasterB) While Dark Souls story is told through the environment (and i respect and commend that), Code Vein is more Hands on. But more to the story later.C) Abilities, (so called Blood Codes and Gifts), Armors (so called ""Blood Veils"") and Weapons feel great and distinct.D) I like Anime. And this Game is certainly Anime.Gameplay:After you finished creating your character, which will take between 1 hour and 1 day (so many options.) you will find out the Gameplay is very soulslike. Stamina-management (dodge-rolls for days), heavy or light armor and/or weapons and items. If you played Dark Souls you should probably know what to expect. If not, in short: it´s a hard game. Not Dark Souls hard, but hard. Levels are medium sized but packed with enemys. Healing is limited and death is punished severly. It´s cycle of dying and respawning (which like Dark Souls is woven into the Story). If you rush it, you get destroyed. Every Map has a Boss (usually at least) which has to be defeated. Of course you won´t just hit your enemies until they die. You also have your Blood Codes and Gifts. Blood Codes are abiltiy sets. They all feature their so called gifts and their own stats (Strength, dexterity, Vitality, max HP, etc.). You can master most gifts to use them with other Blood Codes (but they still require certain stats, so you can´t use everything with anything). Blood Codes have passive and active abilities. Passive are always active and mostly feature ressistances or stat-upgrades. Active have to be activated, which requires Ichor. You gain ichor through hitting enemies with melees or drain attacks (charged attacks, back attacks which do not work for most bosses, etc.). You can either challenge those Maps and Bosses alone or get a friend and fight together - But only until the Boss is defeated. After that you can´t have a friend while remaining in a Map with a defeated boss. You can also choose a NPC-companion to accompany you. They will certainly help with Boss-aggro and turn down the difficulty by quite a bit. Unlike in Dark Souls, there is no PvP.Story:If you watched a few decent Anime you probably know what to expect. The story features a cast of colorful characters with you, a mute, as the main character. The Lore seems to run deeper than i could´ve ever expected. But the Basics are: You are a Revenant, a deceased human implanted with a BOR-Parasite. As long as your heart isn´t destroyed you come back to live. But reviving for the first time cost you most of your memorys. And the more you die, the more memorys you lose. Revenants need to feed of human blood, or blood beads which appear on certain springs. If a Revenant does not feed of human blood for to long they frenzy and become lost, a mindless hollow creature which can corrupt into even worse. Every Revenant has it´s own Blood Code, which they are bound too. Except for you, you can absorb any Blood Code. Revenants have been created to boaster the army against one of the first Revenants (or just one of the strongest one), the so called Queen. The game is at first about finding the source of Blood beads years after the Queen has been defeated in the so called operation queenslayer. But the story deepens the more you find out. It features 3 Endings of which i have two discovered. The Good Ending. A satisfying and emotional ending.The Neutral Ending. Yet to play.The Bad Ending. It´s not even bad. It´s terrible. Horrible. Depressing. I never want to see it again. Sound, etc.Sound and Voice-over are great. Having the japanese dub available with english subtitles is great. But if you enjoy dubbed Anime, the english dub does not disappoint either.And the music is just great. Those almost devine tracks are just so good to listen too. I am a hardcore electro fan who doesn´t really like slow tracks but i found myself sitting in the main menu just taking in the music.Problems:Level design is a bit bland at the start. It doesn´t feature the frustration of not finding anything in Dark Souls but it is certainly missing some depth in the design.FPS Drops in the wierdes Ares. I walk through an empty hallway with 40 FPS while everything else works fine. Wierd, but certainly not a dealbreaker.Way to many cutscenes following each other. I enjoy the story but bloody hell, i get to a boss, watch cutscene, defeat it, watch a cutscene, go down some stairs, cutscene, go up those same stairs, cutscene. Either make it one cutscene, or give something inbetween.Conclusion:I finished the game at exactly 0:00 at the end of last Year. So this is my GOTY 2019. I love it and recommend it wholeheartedly to any Dark Souls fan, any anime fan and anyone else. I never put that much effort in reviews, but this time i had to. Well, back to playing for the neutral ending. And then the good ending again because i feel like crap because of the bad ending.			"
Recommended,72.4,"																The least punishing souls-like game. Not that it's not fun, in fact I really enjoyed it. What I like about it:- Music of course, it has to be at least nominated for the best soundtrack.- Overall visual.- The world.- Monster design.- The combat, once I'm used to it.- You can sleep.What I don't like:- Sound design, despite having such a great soundtrack.

Recommended,69.8,"																git pull origin gud I see a lot of people complaining about sluggish controls? Uhhh are you getting a full 60fps? Because that’s not my experience. I see people complaining about hit detection. Eeeh not really, try pulling gud to local. Personally I can confirm that there are some loading issues, even when the game is installed on an m.2 - this is when the game stutters (between zones) Personally I enjoy the game, but I don’t have time to play video games as much as I used to in order to pick them apart. Character creator alone is probably worth half the price of the game, I do wish there were more clothing options - maybe we can unlock more later. Combat system is legit as hell, mastering classes lets you use those skills on other classes. Which is amazing, you could probably spend a lot of extra time just unlocking all of the skills and spells to theory craft different builds, I know I’m only in the second non intro zone and I have something like 11? Blood codes already it’s nuts Story is kinda cool, generic anime Bandai namco stuff but it makes it more of an interesting play through, sometimes in fromsoftware games it’s kinda cool to figure stuff out but damn sometimes I just wanna know what’s going on without thinking too hard or having to do a bunch of research Overall, if you can afford it at $60 try it - you’ve got 2 hours to refund if you hate it.

Recommended,12.9,"																*Video game journalist hate this game, so you should probably buy it :)Code vein is yet another souls like game yet feels fresh somehow.Relatively high difficulty, death means losing currency etc. You can see countless system that they borrowed from From software combined with their own God Eater mechanics . World setting is also pretty dark and grim :/Visually it's pretty much God Eater 3 with some intense HDR in certain areas. Gameplay-wise with a similar mechanic which comes with animation of ""devour"" from God eater series. There no set ""classes"" and you can change it on the fly. All classes come with certain skill trees which is pretty neat. You can have a companion with you all time so far and you can choose who to take with you. They are actually really helpful can even fight early bosses for you without u actually doing much. The companions are pretty overpowered that i think they all have a skill can revive you with a short cool down which can save you multiple times in a boss fight.They also added the bloodbourne chalice dungeon system in this but I haven't tried yet. You find map, you go in there but I don't really know it's randomized or not.Overall I'd say so far so good. What I don't really like is that hit detection feels weird in places and they are over-using ambushes in early levels.All in all give it a shot I think this one is worth a buy.			"
Recommended,317,"																Diet Anor Londo is one of if not the worst level designs I have ever encountered in a game. This game already felt like a walking sim with the easy combat and pushover bosses, but this takes it to the next level. You can walk around for hours in Cathedral of the Copy Paste just to find yourself back at the beginning or a door you can't even open. I gave the game several chances but this is the final nail in the coffin. An interesting skill system, fun customization system, and an alright generic orchestral OST can't save this lukewarm game.			"
Recommended,37.1,"																When I buy this game I saw in the tags soullike games and I said to myself ok let's try this game. Oh boy this game is awesome, the story that envolve the game, the soundtrack, the level design (some levels will remind you places in Dark Soul franchise and Elden Ring), the charecters, the waifus and hasbandos, there are well polish and you can team up with them. I don't now if there is a anime for this game, but at least for me I feel all the emotions in the game, drama, sadness, happiness, friendships, etc. Like in dark souls and elden ring you have to grind, upgrade you armor and weapons, you can chose your play style be unlock blood veils and gifts (actives and passives), you also need to learn the mechanic of the bosses like the enemies and of course you will died often. I think the difference in dark souls franchise and this game is the way the game tells the story, because is perceptive to the player an like dark souls. Even today after played the three games I still don't get the story 100%, but is ok, I love the franchise the way it is.			"

Recommended,18,"																Here's how I feel about this game CRINGECODEWIFUSa Dark Souls wanna be game that relies heavily on fan services.It's your very very typical shounen anime story and characters.the ""cool"" guy voiced by Junichi Suwabe (typical) you can already know this character very well just by how he looks and by knowing his voice actor. Same with the loli blonde voiced by Ai Kayano... yeah, what a surprise. not to mention the emotionless character .... that... talks .......really...............really....................slow-................ly.......... .a bunch of teens acting like they know how to fix the world or whatever.Even during the tutorial, they have this ""wifu"" teaching you stuff and telling you in a weird moan to save the world. was I supposed to ..get aroused? or fired up to grant this ""wifu"" her wish? I don't know, for me I felt CringeAnd your Character is obviously the Silent type that can't take the effort of even making a sound. you just keep replying with shaking head, ""how did you do that?"" you reply: *shake head* (that means ""I don't know""). great...80% of the budget of this game was spent on fan services and character creation.The environment is a very typical anime style post-apocalypse with many weird thingies coming outta the floor. There are only around 3-4 areas that looked different from that.GameplayIf you're a Dark Souls player, this is what you'll probably think ""naaah, you guys have no idea how to make this kinda game"".the combat is trash with anime ""cool"" motions and poses as your ""parry"" attacks. You wave this ""huge"" ultra great sword as if it was a plastic toy hitting the enemy and they're standing still looking at you like ""you done bro?...."".The AI is really stupid sometimes, I hit them from a lower floor and they're just standing like nothing happened until they die.some bosses have some unblockable AOE attacks that hit 95% of the space you're fighting them in. or have this consecutive fast attacks that your evasions just won't be much of help (even with very light and fast gear), Their consecutive attacks are faster than the animation of your evasions, guaranteed hits for them. It's like the game forces you to have a partner (which can be an AI) since they can revive you. The parry attacks in this game are just horrible when it come to parrying from behind the enemy. you get behind the enemy and try to parry them but it doesn't work. I found that some enemies can be parried from the right side of the back.... that's the ""back"" spot for them I guess, I don't know, they're freaks.All bosses felt Sh!-tty to me and badly designed (look wise and combat wise).The locking is really bad as well. When you lock on an enemy and there's another one nearby, If the enemy is not ""fully"" visible in your screen you can't switch to it.Almost all enemies have the same vibrating voice effect which is also used in most anime for monsters.There are only like 12-13 enemies in the whole damn game. you'll fight the same ones in almost every map, just having a different color or something, and only 1 extra move.Memories is this thing in this game which you go inside someone's memories or whatever. Way too boring, thankfully you can skip them, But some of them can't be skipped, and you can't just go AFK either, you have to watch them and keep walking very slowly and wish there was an end to this torture.The Dungeons in the game or the Depth are badly designed. Repetitive, fighting against bosses you've already beaten.The UI of the game is so stupidly bad looking. a bunch of icons that look like they were made using Paint for Windows. Some of them don't even make sense.The maps layouts are annoying AF. I'm an explorer kind of player. I like to explore everything.I explored every inch of this game's maps, but exploring them was sooo not fun, They were annoying and frustrating and a waste of time and not interesting at all. Co-Op is TRASHIf you want to play with your friend, you won't have much problems. but you'll still come across some stupid stuff like, You can't see what treasures or loots your host has not taken yet. They're only visible to them. And some other stuff that I don't even remember.However! if you want to just help some random players, you'll have to ""search"" (and you can't do anything else while you're doing that, you can't even move, nothing), And the search takes like 5 seconds max and tells you ""you couldn't find a match"" ... what?? ...... DUH !! you only searched for 5 damn seconds !! you think you have 19283719462374525 players looking for help 24/7 ? You'll have to keep pressing the Search button every 5 seconds for a long time and then surprisingly you'll find a match ! (which has a high chance you'll get disconnected from during the loading). That's assuming you'll find one eventually... good luck with that. I sincerely wish you a good luck for that.Stupidest match making search I've ever tried.The only three good things in this game1. Character creation. yeah, it's not bad at all with so many useless things as well.2. Character models (for anime looking characters).3. Builds. When you level up, you level up everything. You don't have to pick what to level up and what to not only to find this weapon or spell you want to use and get crushed by the requirements to use them. It's good to sometimes not think about these stats and know what build you should go with early on or in NG+. In this game you have what's called ""Blood Code"" which is basically your class that you can switch whenever you want and they have some abilities that can be unlocked for other classes. So you can create kind of a costume class.			"
Recommended,23.6,"																As someone who has limited experience in the Soulsborne style, I didn't go in with my expectations tempered from other games in this style. So imagine my surprise when I ended up loving the game. While everyone's already talked about the character creator, there's no denying how great that is in the game. As for everything else in the game, it's all pretty good. Story is a bit cliched but still has a lot of great moments and memorable characters. The soundtrack is also great with some awesome orchestral tracks and memorable boss music in the later half of the game. The combat is also really good but it's a lot like DMC5 where you only get out of it what you put in. If you take the time to learn the combo and gift system you can play hyper aggressively and do a lot of cool ♥♥♥♥ that feels awesome to pull off, but if you just go through the game spamming light attacks and dodges it's gonna feel underwhelming. Like it works but you'll be missing a lot of the experience. Coop in the game is also pretty fun, but there are a few bugs here and there and overall I felt like Ni Oh had the better coop system but it's still a ton of fun in Code Vein. Map design is also very hit or miss. Most of the maps were fine for the most part, but a few areas like the Cathedral are hard to navigate and don't do a great job showing the way forward. In one of the late game areas it made sense considering the location but the Cathedral was annoying to navigate on a first time playthrough. Related to that are Lost Invasions, which are one of my least favorite mechanics, as it likes to throw a bunch of annoying enemies at you at once that are more resistant to getting hit stunned, but most of those are optional as well and you're usually able to tell where it'll occur. Overall, I'd probably give the game an 8/10. Do I think it's worth the full price? Yea. Even in the parts that I wasn't huge of I still found something to enjoy in the game, and it never was for something that was so bad it was enjoyable, it was genuine enjoyment of the mechanics, the visuals, and the soundtrack. Would say it's worth at least giving a shot.			"

Recommended,110.5,"																Edit: Steam can't publish long review, thus edit.TL;DR: Code Vein is great, having both some easier and some harder difficulties than your standard souls sub-genre, but gets a bit predictive due to its theme park-esque hub worlds, but I still do recommend it, if you're interested in the souls sub-genre or the God Eater franchise.Code Vein (CV) is a great game, despite running on the Unreal Engine (quite an overrated engine, best suited for shooter genre, outside of that... isn't exactly its forté. As I experienced several lag (not plural) as in happening once in a while after the game boots up, and it made CV crash once, but went fine other times.CV is great game, seeing as I had a current session of 12 hours and 5 minutes one day which is very rare in this day and age.But I recommend it due to: If you're either interested in Dark Souls or God Eater franchises, you'll probably find a liking to either. The story's not the greatest, but it's higher than serviceable. Gameplay's also a bit higher than being good, like in between good and great. Now, if you've already played the Souls sub-genre, you're most likely already experienced in what you need to know, just like any other FPS game where they advertise it's for ""hardcore FPS gamers""... which are just trying to cater to the hardcores, but it's something more or less people already have experience in and can be good at.Alas, back to the game, what CV offers you, is cooperation with a companion, with a rather great AI compared to many other games I've played featuring companions, in CV they'll actively try to help from dying, block enemies' line of sight to prevent hitting you even when you're casting spells (although the blocking isn't there when you and your companion are in close quarters fighting). You can also summon another player, making things even easier.To conclude, I'd just like to say, CV is also a theme park... in that sense that the hub worlds are based around certain things, like fire, ice, lightning, etc. with some few exception, and for the most part never carry theses elements to the other hub worlds, making it sort of predictive in themes, in addition to these hub worlds not being too hard enough, and that your archnemesis is and will probably always be death due to fall. Oh, and there are either 3 or 4 endings, so that can keep you busy if you like achievement hunting... but with one big catch, and that is farming 400 Medals of Honor, and you are rewarded 1 medal if you help a player out on killing a boss, and at level 120+ you won't find many needing help... but there are alternative ways of farming, which is mind numbing.

Recommended,64,"																Overall for a souls like game it wasn't that bad, it has its moments from the start to end. This game isn't for everyone. Everything in the story is told to you. there was no need to read at all sadly. which i kind of hated just sitting through the cut scenes but they were a nice touch to the game and made me feel really immersed in the Code Vein World. I personally really liked the character customization, but the story line wasn't that great, literally full metal alchemist with ""lost"" or mobs. every character wasnt really that interesting in my opinion they all were pretty cookie cutter if you replace the people and things with their life. The character customization is very small but offers a lot when it comes to accessories where you can make and create some pretty cool characters to play as. The combat system wasn't the best as even with auto lock it never auto locks, not sure if it was a mouse issue or if i needed to play with controller. Also some hit boxes don't make sense in some areas and frames and would definitely be a thing that can make or break the game. such as missing a hit when i was clearly a centimeter away from the monster, not covid 6feet apart.  The maps and locations where probably the most interesting part of the game for every location you might fight a new monster ect. honestly partners kind of killed the game to an extent imo but makes the idea for the game nice and different. Also Louis is a bit busted as the ai system will sometimes loop for him to dodge 24/7 lol it was kind of funny to watch as both ai never wanted to attack and his dodges being frame perfect. The locations such as the cathedral weren't that bad as you do have a map that can tell you were your past steps were and use logic to figure out where you need to go, but landmarks would have been a nicer touch if they had added it.Overall I rate the game a 7/10 interesting idea but the execution mixed with a lot of bugs was kind of a turn off but i still enjoyed the game nonetheless. if you do read this review and you are looking for a decent game this is a good one to spend some time on.

Recommended,12.1,"																Absolutely must have for anyone who likes anime but also love the dark souls games. The story is VERY good, the combat is great and very dynamic combined with many different abilities and builds, everyone is completely different from each other. The character customisation is literly the best iv ever seen in any game so far.  The combat can be intense but fun!  The good thing about this game is that its no where near as brutal as Dark souls, its much fairer even for casuals but contains alot of challenge too for the more hardcore thrill seakers so there is a balance, this also helps with the pace of the game, so your not bored having to farm the ♥♥♥♥ out of one area like in dark souls.   Its far better in my opinion and i never once found myself bored.There is a TON of story, tons of content and sweeteners in the game for instance you can get your character to sit anywhere in the Home Base, and if ur afk for so long your character literly falls asleep gradually XD(also there is a Bath House in the game, yes, its amazing)This game is a must have in my opinion, you get your moneys worth and then some. The voice acting is incredible and well polished with some of the most brillaint english voice acters out there.   Buy this game, its a must have.			"

Recommended,62,"																this game takes a lot from the souls games and it adds your typical shounen anime story.pro: it's a souls-like, lots of customization with weapons, armor and blood codes (abilities and magic) that you can swap at any timecon: aside from a certain boss which I found harder than its dark souls doppelganger the game is pretty easy to play, companions barely die and you get no penalty for using them. also no invasions like in other souls games, you can only summon people for help.spoiler alert: apparently the game's story is tied to the God Eater series			"

Recommended,113.2,"																First played on ps4 then got it again on pc. it was fun and i do love anime and the gothic theme!!  i liked the game alot until you get to the white cathedral. Probably the worst level design ever. its very hard to tell where you are going and it was very easy to get lost... i spent hours lost there... so annoying.Overall though this was a good  introduction to souls like games for me. From what i hear this game is easier than dark souls or blood borne. that's ok though because i  mostly came to have fun being an anime vampire girl in a apocalyptic Gothic setting. stories kinda shallow but  8/10 if the level design wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the cathedral. overall, 6.5?/10 for the trauma i have faced idk			"
Recommended,26.2,"																Never been much of a souls-like player but this feels like a more like a mmo (the bosses can feel like a souls-like but not to hard to learn)also the fact that your decision affect the end of the game and can determine how powerful you are end game gives it replay-ability .Only downside is the multiplayer is a bit underwhelming wanted to play duos with someone i knew but at least you can help someone with boss fights so not pointless.(EDIT: make sure you have the game saved on a ssd or something the game is local saved, had a windows update get corrupted and reset my pc and lost my save, luckily i already 100% the game and everything)			"
Recommended,186.9,"																bruh why this game so hard?Basically, there's this feature in the game where you have to use haze (the currency of the game) to level up your character and go above level 1. Thing is, I have a singular braincell left, because karen took my other 3 braincells, so I didn't know you were supposed to level up. That made me go through nearly the whole beginning content (from Oliver Collins Boss fight to The execution bossfight (idk what this boss was called, it's the pole dancing water polearm chick)) on level ONE! Bruh, I did like no damage and I had to rely on my Sekiro Shadows Die Twice parry skills and my amazing 300ms reaction speed to dodge attacks and survive. So then I figured out that you can't parry bosses... (who tf made this a thing...? why would you forsake my only option for survival?) anyways, I couldn't parry the poledancing chick and she was a pain in the ass to fight... so ofc, like any normal gamer, I took to the interwebs to see what I was missing, and when I looked at a tutorial, the guy in it had like 1.5k hp. So then, I began to realize, oh ♥♥♥♥, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, and then looked at the comments and some guy said that he first tried her on level 15... Then I went back into the game to see what level I was, because, with my singular braincell, I thought I that levels were gained through xp like NORMAL RPG GAMES! But nooooo, these devils made levels obtainable through haze, and guess what? I was a dumbass again, because I didn't realize that there was a mistle like right next to the boss fight, I thought I had to go through the entire map to get back to the boss, and during that process, I lost like 50k Haze, (it's not that much in endgame, but that's A LOT for the beginning area) anyways, since I had like 0 haze, I had to grind those stupid giant moth bird men to get haze, and I had to beat the damn boss at level 8...Basically, This game is hella fun, I just finished playing my first run through and got the good/true ending, I'm planning on replaying the game and getting all the endings and enjoying the game more, maybe answer distress calls... But yea, now that we're done talking about my dumb stupid braincell, we can talk about the sudden and uncalled for difficulty spikes...Ok, so where do I begin...? alright, lets start at Argent Wolf Berserker... Typically, boss fight arenas are huge and give you some cover, or enough room to dodge the bosses attacks, well guess what? This boss fight is in some tiny rectangular arena and has no cover, with barely any walkspace, if this wasn't bad already, the boss has a second phase (alright, all bosses have second phases, but this bosses second phase was soooooo annoying) basically, he swings this huge ass hammer/axe around with insane speed, giving you almost no time to go in to attack, because he has no recharge moment, like other fast/hard hitting bosses in the future. So, I was stuck there for like a day, doesn't sound bad, but I had to fight those stupid queen puppet guards and they were sooooo annoying to fight, so I usually went into the arena with like 1-3 less healing. I finally gave up and called for backup/distress, whatever you call the co op button, EVEN WITH MY CO OP AS A SUPPORT and we still almost died to the boss... So that's the first difficulty spike, what? you thought that was all? HELL NO, anyways, the second difficulty spike was probably the Queens Knight in your memory, he was hard... but manageable, after learning his attack pattern he was easy... and speaking of easy... why THE ♥♥♥♥... are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SUCCESSORS AND THE FINAL BOSS, easier than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini bosses????? I basically first tried all the successors, except for the successor of the ribcage, her second phase fire attacks were annoying, but manageable... anyways, I DIED TO THE FINAL BOSS 3 TIMES AND ALSO I DIED TO SILVA 3 TIMES, BUT THEY WERE SO EASY, AND SPEAKING OF DYING, GUESS WHO DIDN'T DIE IN THE DUO BOSS OF CANNONEER AND BLADE BEARER? YEA, THEY WERE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EASY, DON'T ♥♥♥♥ ON ME BUT THEY WERE SO EASY, JUST FOCUS ON ONE GUY AND LET YAKUMO DISTRACT THE OTHER, anyways, I'm gonna get an aneurysm screaming, but after that duo boss, I felt really good about myself, and guess who comes rolling around the corner? Yea... Judo Mido, he was hard... kinda... but guess who else? wait... ♥♥♥♥, I think this guy came before... eh whatever... my review, my rules... anyways, yea, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gilded Hunter came strolling in, This mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss, oh my god... whoever the ♥♥♥♥ designed him actually will end up in hell... his first phase was already hard enough, with his stupid Dark Souls esque attacks, and then, guess what? HE GETS FASTER AND STRONGER, THIS ♥♥♥♥♥ DASHES INTO YOU, STUNS YOU, THEN SWINGS HIS SPEAR HORIZONTALLY, THE ONLY SAFE PLACE TO DODGE IT WOULD BE HIS BACK, BUT THATS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM, HE DOESN'T STOP THERE, AFTER HE FINISHES THAT ATTACK, YOU WOULD ASSUME YOU COULD GO IN, GET SOME DAMAGE, THEN DODGE.... LIKE EVERY OTHER BOSS YOU FIGHT... CORRECT? BUT NOOOOOOOoooOoOOoO~, HE CONTINUES, UNTIL HE HAS TO RECHARGE, WHICH IS LIKE 20 SECONDS AFTER HE STARTS GOING ON THAT RAMPAGE... ♥♥♥♥♥, FIRST OF ALL, I CANT REACT IN TIME FOR THOSE ATTACKS, MAKING IT SO HARD TO DODGE, SECOND, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAMINA FOR THIS ♥♥♥♥♥, ok well, yea I sorta figured out that you can block his spear... idk what made me try blocking, but yakumo kept blocking whenever he went rampage, so I just copied him, and it worked... and you can actually beat him really easily by just blocking... anyways... did I mention I was a halberd main? Yea, The Gilded Knight Drops the Dark Knight Blood Code, which is the halberd class Code, and that just made the entire end content soooooo easy, especially combining it with the obliterator axe... hold on a minute... I just realized that both of these are from 2 of the hardest bosses in the game for me... huh... I guess I just enjoy MAKING THEM SUFFER AND USING THEIR DAMN WEAPONS AGAINST THEM.... HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH.... *cough* *cough* sorry... got wayyyyyy too into it there...Anyways, another thing that I find surprising is that I've been reading a lot about code vein online and people have been saying how broken the fortified zweihander is, you can negate almost all damage, because it's a broadsword, and it does hella damage... but I raise you this... if you don't wanna cheese the game and try beating it as a halberd main, try the Obliterator Axe, Dark Knight Class, with Halberd Mastery, Shadow Assault and Chariot Rush... It's a really good combo for any halberd mains out there... Anyways, this game is really awesome, the (true) ending makes me really want to play Code Vein 2, and I'd say this is a great game to get you into a hard but fun (basically dark souls) game (but easier) and I would highly recommend everyone to get it, or at least, try it out, the story is amazing, and the graphics are pretty good. I just wish that I had gotten this game when it came out in 2019, I was broke and I had to settle in by watching people play this game on youtube, but finally, a humble bundle bundle came out with code vein in the bundle for like 25 bucks, and that was a steal... and was 25 bucks worth it...? Nope, because I would pay the full price of this game.TLDR: PLAY THIS GAME, BUT IT'S HARD ;-; ALSO I'M A HALBERD MAIN, DON'T BULY ME WITH YOUR FORTIFIED ZWEIHANDER CHEESE BUILD ;-;Thanks for reading my review? I guess? Sorry It's so long, this game is just soooo good and I have soooo many things that I can talk about this game... maybe I'll even make a video about this... hmmmmm anyways, check out my youtube channel... https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNnsyRga5Vk7LaDxA6jCwMQ ... hahahahaha... sorry It was too perfect of a place to plug my channel... I'm sorry... anyways, like I said... thanks for reading my review, and I'll cya!			"

Recommended,22.1,"																What I played it on: Laptop with an i7 7700 HQ, GTX 1060 6 GB and 32 GB DDR4 installed on an NVMe SSD. Controller use varied from PS4 dual shock to an Xbox one controller.Code Vein is a fine combination of Bandai Namco anime aesthetic and the souls-like formula with a few performance issues and relatively flat boss fights.What I liked:1. Io2. Souls-like combat and mechanics3. In-depth character creator4. Almost shounen manga type storytelling that doesn't require a visit to VaatiVidya5. Certain boss arenas which look spectacular6. Flexibility and combat variety due to blood veils and blood codes which you can switch on the fly7. Cinematic animations for parries and backstabs8. Vestiges which give a lot of depth into the backstories of certain characters especially for Mia's brother and Yakumo's friendsWhat I didn't like:1. Random dips in framerate which makes certain parts seem janky at best2. Questionable hitboxes for certain bosses3. Iffy nature of where the backstab hitbox is4. NPC chatter (except Io because Io is a good girl and should be protected)5. Enemy variety seems to lack especially towards the end6. Two labyrinth-like areas which take forever to go throughI'll update this review again after the release of the new DLC areas next year.			"
Recommended,126.7,"																 Honest review : + Game is good and solid+ Seems easier than dark souls (in 1st playthrough)+ Weeb+ Advanced Customization character creation+ Story have some plot twist and it's good+ Side story will gave you more detail about what settings and what world is Code Vein+ Various build, so you can make your own style in this game (there is 150 skill total, including buff, from achievement alone)+ Class change on the fly+ PvE Coop+ Seems runs good in old spec- No Day 1 patch released  it's already released- Some micro stuttering, but i guess it will be fixed in next patch it's fixed in the last patch- Some minor bug etc- I wish we get additional time before send back to our world (MP, to gave some farewell msg maybe)- Currently there is no ""physic"" editor except the slider only ._. (wait for new patch) Verdict : The game is really solid, first stage is easy, but the difficulty will spike later in the story, and you might get frustrated later especially if you go solo (no Ai companion). there is also ""Anor Londo"" in this game, but WAY MUCH BIGGER map and well, you'll be frustrated enough to 100% map it xD. Score :  9/10			"
Recommended,274.1,"																I've decided to write an in-depth review for this game, for a TL;DR skip to the bottom.Masterpiece, there's really no other word I can use to aptly describe this game. From the music, to the character creator, to the story. Every aspect of this game feels like it was expertly crafted to fit together perfectly and it's a beautiful work of art. Let's start with something I haven't seen anyone else talk about: the music. The music for this game is absolutely beautiful. The first time I played this game back in June during the network test I got chills after hearing the title screen music. It's epic, it's breathtaking, it's absolutely incredible. Every single track of this game is amazing, from the classical orchestra music to the modern rock songs they sprinkle in. Each song is beautiful in its own right. There are few games with such distinct, incredible music as this game. I would say the music of this game is comparable to the likes of Halo and The Elder Scrolls, games with music that has been remembered for decades.Next the combat. The combat in this game is of course, soulslike, however it strikes out on its own and innovates for the subgenre. The combat and controls feel crisp and responsive, the combat feels and looks beautiful and satisfying. When I'm controlling my character I feel like I'm performing a wondrous dance around my enemies as I spray their blood around me. Everything about the combat feels deliberate and well balanced and honestly I haven't had this much fun with game in a long time.The story. It's complex, beautiful, memorable, and evokes a lot of emotion in me, especially when paired with the music. All of the characters are distinct and fleshed out. I like them all for different reasons and they each play a different and important part in the story. The plot of the game itself leaves you hungry for more information constantly while feeding you enough to get by on as you search for more. The lore and the history of the world around me feels rich and full of life. I love exploring and seeing how the stories buried in the ashes unravel as I learn more. The story just pulls you in right from the start and never slows down. The graphics. For an anime game I've honestly never seen better graphics before, everything flows so beautifully and while there is absolutely lots of clipping, especially with concerns to hair, I've found that most games have plenty of hair clipping, especially anime type games, so I can't really get too bothered by it. The models and scenery is all incredible and I'm not going to get hung up on some minor clipping issues.The character creator. As I'm sure you have already heard, the character creator is definitely one of the games strong points (of which it has many) and is incredibly in depth and complex. The characters you can make in Code Vein are truly special and exotic and the aesthetic style of the game itself complements this fact wonderfully. Optimization. The game runs at a beautiful 100+ fps consistently on max settings, loading screens take mere seconds to load, and I have not seen any stuttering or screen tearing, so I'd say it's quite well optimized. Of course, it's important to note that I have a high end PC, so this is just my personal experience with the game. TL;DROverall this game is a masterpiece, every aspect of it is designed to work in perfect unison and the end result is a magnificent work of art.Graphics: 9/10Sound: 10/10Story: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Overall: 96/100 Masterpiece, but still imperfect. If you liked Dark Souls you'll definitely enjoy Code Vein. Minor note: During the aforementioned network test I participated in I spent 13 hours in the game, so my true playtime is whatever Steam says I have in the game, plus 13 hours.			"

Recommended,25.3,"																Big tiddy anime Dark Souls Lite. So many waifus, dude. Like, so many.Order of events:1. Create detailed lady character.2. Play the tutorial.3. Acquire waifu.4.

Code Vein is, overall, easier than Dark Souls; it's by no means relaxing, but progress comes at a steady, satisfying pace.The lore for the world is much more readily accessible; cutscenes abound and are even individually rewatchable in the ""Hot Spring"" area.Character stat and ability progression is Code Vein's unique aspect. You can effectively reclass at any time between an expanding inventory of ""Blood Codes."" Your code dictates most major aspects of your character; health, stamina, carrying capacity, and stats like strength, dexterity are tied to your code. The downside to this is that you can only take build optimization so far (quick movement with big weapons is generally impossible).			"

"
Recommended,21.8,"																If you enjoy souls-like gameplay, then there's a chance you'll find something to enjoy with Code Vein. I had high hopes and, for the most part, enjoyed playing the game. Overall, the level design is lackluster. The environments are same-y, with each area built in a faux-labyrinth style. There's little to no sense of discovery. There's just walking down each hallway you haven't before until you find that one repeat item you saw sparkling from afar. About halfway through the game, I realized that the formula for each area was roughly the same and the mystery was ruined. From there, I knew every beat I could expect to hit in each new area.The combat is nice, but clunky. The difficulty spike on some enemies makes no sense and serves more as a perceived ""challenge"" than a satisfying ramp. The bosses are cool and there are a lot of them, but I never felt much sense of accomplishment defeating any boss after the first 3 or so.If you like story-driven games, then this one might be for you. I ended up skipping all of the many, many cutscenes that play after what seemed like every transaction. There's a lot of padding here that thankfully I was able to skip. Not saying there's anything wrong with overt narrative pieces, but it wasn't for me.Did I have fun smashing things in a Dark Souls ripoff? (trust me, it draws way too much ""inspiration"" to feel fresh) - yes.Did I finish the game out of spite and so it wouldn't haunt my backlog for eternity? - also yes.Played and completed in ~18 hours (skipping nearly all cutscenes).Verdict - not for me, but maybe for you.

Recommended,148.2,"																I tend to go in-depth when I review games I feel strongly about so here goes.I've had one full playthrough at the time of this review and all I'll say is I absolute love this game.It's a souls-like game in an anime world with a pretty great story.And somehow this game also has some awesome character development, had me invested enough to tear up a couple of times. Can't say that ever happened in any Dark Souls before so that was a nice touch.I'll just go basic and make a straightforward pros/cons list.ProsVery solid combatReally good storyAwesome diverse charactersAmazing boss designsGreat musicAdjustable difficulty through interchangeable optional partnersUnique post-apocalyptic theme for the world and gearBlood codes are also interchangeable and a really interesting class-like systemShockingly great character creation/customizationConsVery few weapon types (5) and gear in general is kinda lackingThere's a pretty hefty amount of reskins for mobsNPC ""Invasions"" are basically enemy swarms, which feels very uninspired as opposed to one strong opponentVery awkward level transitions. (If you've played DS2, think the one between Majula and Heide's Tower of Flame)All in all, if I had to give a rating I'd give it a solid 9.5. I enjoyed all of it. To me, these cons barely affect your first playthrough because the story is just SO good. But the game has a lot less replayability than the DS games, mainly due to less build possibilities caused by a lack of weapon types. There aren't that many different armors either. Honestly, if the DLC's for this game bring out 2-3 more weapon types and 10+ new armors, I would more than likely consider it a 10/10. It really is an incredible game well-worth the purchase.			"
Recommended,60.4,"																Code Vein is an astoundingly good fresh IP. It's core gameplay is that of most souls games, but it has it's own unique spin on the genre. Most notably through the system of ""Vestiges"". This Vestiges offer the player lore surrounding key characters and others related to the main story. By collecting Vestiges you get not only more of the story, but also classes for your character. It feels incredibly rewarding to seek out more of what the game has hidden both story-wise and mechanic-wise. As a nice bonus, it has a fleshed out character creator. You can honestly lose a few hours just from that, which is always a plus to me. Overall I thoroughly enjoy this game and hope to see more from it in the future.			"

Not Recommended,70.7,"																Wish there was a meh option but seeing as there isn't I can't in good faith recommend. There's a lot of good ideas, swapping classes, mixing and matching abilities letting you experiment with different abilities/playstyles without being locked into one really.A lot of the game feels very lazy/unpolished though. Most of the environments didn't feel interesting (particularly the fire area). Most of the animations feel very stiff and clunky as well as some of the combat in general. Most of the bosses are pretty okay to good, but a lot of the areas are kind of a slog which absolutely kills replay value. As a souls fan having a follower trivializes most of the game but there are some fights/encounters (one in particular) that are definitely designed around having a follower.Also this game contains my least favorite area to play through in a game ever. ♥♥♥♥ the cathedral area.TL;DR There are some good ideas here but they don't carry how clunky and unpolished the game is.

Has some bugs (Elevators and net code) and some annoying game design choices with some traps and mechanics but sorta part and parcel of a souls-like.Overall very fun, get on sale and play with a friend.

Recommended,37.5,"																CODE VEIN is a anime souls-like that is lower quality than dark souls but still does the trick in making itself a unique and solid in its own terms , being easier and having some clunky-ness in its combat system and shorter than DS overall , but its story and characters and the complexity in its items and blood code and veil system makes it up for the former things mentioned.PROS :1- having one of the best characters creation and customization system i ever seen in a game , everything can be customized with tons of accessories , and whats even better that you can change your appearance ANY TIME during the story , including changing cloths or complete makeover , you also can save a certain looks to load and use later. 2- having a more understandable story and unique characters that are actually likable unlike most of the souls games which focus only at environments and bosses , sure the story will be confusing at first , but as you press on after ~5 hours , you will put the pieces together.3- this game have an easy mode that is not actually a mode , but just bringing a partner with you on your mission , as in this game your partner actually does a lot of helping in battles and providing hints , if you want a true 'dark souls type' experience just go on the mission alone.4-having a good tracking system that actually helps not getting lost and providing info of the areas you explored or you didn't yet , as their is tons of secrets areas in this game , especially some hidden items that helps getting the best ending that are missable.CONS :1-this game is very cutscene friendly , you will sometimes bump into 3 and 4 cutscenes in a row  , also there are some 'memories' segments that  both are story related and optional that provides info on the characters background and the story overall , they are sadly very excessive sometimes which can become tedious , fortunately you can skip all of the above.2-the enemies are samey and don't offer such variety , you'll just run into different skin of the same enemy in multiple areas , unlike the environments which are unique for every area.in the end its recommended for any souls-like fans.

Recommended,30.7,"																Before buying Code Vein, I've read that it was an Anime Souls-like game, and it pretty much is. As someone who has played DS2 and DS3, I found myself really enjoying this game. The Companions you have with you literally 99.9% of the time is what I've always wanted in the souls games. Sure, it's more challenging to do it alone but I don't want to do it alone. The AI conversation can get annoying at times but just having a partner with you (looking at you Yakumo) can really boost your morale and take more risks or engage in more fights. The story is also pretty freakin' awesome. The Feels, the moments with the characters, they're awesome. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it has a learning curve (even one who came from the souls series) and the game doesn't really do a good job at explaining the complex builds and systems it has. But overall, love this game 8.5/10			"

It features waifus with big booba, an insanely good character creator, decent swordplay, and fun class combos.The endings you break your heart, all 4 of them.

Not Recommended,24.4,"																To start with, this is a great game with a relatively challenging combat system that for the most part rewards skill... however there are hiccups in this and those parts really ruin what could have been a near perfect game. What we have here is a great game with some glaring flaws. Full disclosure I have never played Dark Souls. In a game with punishing and difficult combat you expect to have certain features that make the game fair and reasonable. Stuff like bosses and enemies NOT attacking offscreen or at least making some kind of sound so you know when to dodge, Balance for solo play, this game is balanced for you to play co-op or with an ai partner.. The problem with that however is two fold. If you play with the ai partner the game will be SO easy. So very very easy. It's nice to use them when you're learning the game BUUUT they actually prevent you from really learning enemy patterns, when you go solo you will improve dramatically but you'll likely never improve enough to deal with a few key imbalanced bosses, you can use the ai for these battles but it will trivialize the battle and make the victory feel hollow, This problem is exacerbated when you go to NG+ where many attacks will one shot you effortlessly, when those attacks are offscreen it just feels even more unfair. Blade Bearer and Cannoneer are one of the worst offenders, bosses that will hit you offscreen as you deal with one, interrupting your combo potentially dealing massive damage, and causing you to get attacked before you can recover. Even if you can perfectly dodge one of these bosses you won't be able to see the other preparing numerous offscreen attacks with no tells besides visual. The game needs better balance between solo play and ai partner play because as it stands the game is either a joke or so frustratingly unfair at times that you just want to walk away for good. This could easily be solved by eliminating all offscreen attacks OR giving VERY OBVIOUS sound cues for offscreen attacks, otherwise it's just unfair. The camera doesn't support dealing with two bosses at once as a solo player.That said there are plenty of good bosses that are enjoyable to fight and many enemies though devastating all have a viable way of dealing with them and a way to build your character that suits those methods. Over all certain bosses just need a rework, and if you insist on having offscreen attacks then Blade Bearer and Cannoneer should not duo you and instead be separate bosses. There's a mechanic called backstabbing that allows you to go invulnerable as you attack an opponent, this attack can be used on smaller enemies and even a few minibosses to do some damage and restore ichor and even hp with certain passive abilities. It's a little wonky though, on some enemies it's very easy to pull off and on others you'll struggle to find the right angle to make it work. I'd rather have these enemies not be drainable if the intent was to make them more difficult than the basic level enemies.There's also parrying but it's not reliable and you are punished very severely if you don't hit the timing window. There are four different kinds of parries depending on your blood veil and the timing for them and each different attack varies. While it can pay off nicely against small enemies as you'll immediately do a drain attack with i frames, against bosses it will only stun them for a tiny amount of time. The game starts to modulate difficulty by putting mistles (rest points) further and further away from a maps boss, personally I dislike this. When you're exploring you risk taking damage but you can find items, gain haze to level up or learn new skills, and you can use drain attacks to increase your max ichor up to a certain amount depending on your Blood Code (class). Using a mistle heals you and restores your item stocks BUT you lose any ichor increases, making using a mistle already discouraged. Though this is minor and more my personal taste.Caster classes, mages are also severely disadvantaged most of the game and will be for the entire NG if you go for the true ending. Many vital caster skills are locked behind blood codes that are only obtainable in the bad or neutral end, if you don't have the DLC your caster build will simply remain incomplete until you for through a second run. Even with the skills, the expensive DLCs contain some fantastic mage skills and a weapon that actually lets you have decent ichor regeneration for once, without it a pure caster build is squishy, risky, and will be useless in melee range and not obtain too much ichor unless you stick to Artemis, an older blood code with weaker scaling. So some balance for mage builds would have been nice, make sure to do the bad ending first if you like playing mages.Level design can be frustrating, with some stand out truly awful maps that will test your patience. First off, the City of Falling fire. Here you're forced to wear a blood veil with fire resistance as the floor burns you and takes your health off rapidly otherwise. In the Crown of Sand the sand will drain your ichor AND slow you, there's a glitch where you can be stuck at slow speed when leaving the sand and you will have to use stamina just to walk at full speed. The only way to fix it is to slowly fiddle with the sand walking in and out at different spots until it fixes while it drains away even more of your ichor. I find these to be bad gimmicks which can artificially force you to switch builds, I think in games of skill that the enemies are what should test you not environmental hazards which you are forced to deal with.Basically, it's a good game with some very nasty flaws that will ruin certain maps for you either because of unfair bosses that attack you from offscreen or because of dumb environmental hazards that try to make an area artificially more difficult but simply make it more tedious and frustrating to traverse them.If you like playing solo and hate one shots, don't bother with NG+ enhanced difficulty, certain invasions and bosses will just feel cheap. You're better off just keeping your level low as it's more fair that way.I know this review has been kinda down on it but it really is a fun game and I'm certain you'll have an overall good time with it, it needs some fine tuning to be sure but I'll leave that to the devs for a sequel.

Recommended,188.2,"																Toukiden 2 is a better version of this game and it's much older, this game feels like a lazy attempt at souls style to sell on anime and waifu hype that's not even done well. If you plays souls you will realize they lazily copied level designs in teh worst way possible in ways that make 0 sense. Enemies are boring and visually trash boss fighst are much worse than souls 2 combat is clunky and slow with no fluidity. The story is pure ♥♥♥♥ and the spam of cut scene and loading scenes will have you skipping as much as you can. Even the customization is a cash grab cover up. It's like you're expected to be a female or weeb boy who can't even have facial hair. At that you invest in pointless stuff to be covered by a mask or goofy ass weeb boy coat. Even class building is just a cover up. No real defining variety aside from similar things with different names and effects but 0 purpose.  This game is ♥♥♥♥ not buying anything from this company again.Graphics : char models 6/ level design 3Story : 2 Combat: 6 can be fun but dated and definately not worth $40Sound: 3 will annoy you with it's set times to play and overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack Custimization : 7 only reason to play but even then it's garabge compared to any real souls game.

Recommended,38,"																All I wanted was to be one more voice to back up this game. I like it after all.This game has a good story, the characters are likable and the combat can be good given you can forgive some flaws.Some locations are better done than others, specially at near the end as are some boss battles, also at the end, are very engaging and challenging.The combat is very fast paced and not so hard if you pay attention.The companions are cool, however, sometimes you can get the feeling that you are cheating, tho. But if you go alone, something that you can do if you want, you may see that this game was not designed to be played like that and may have a hard time with little reward.IJust look past the anime visual and you will get a very good game that will hook you soon enough with lots of innovations for the genre.And I think that this game is related to God Eater.EDIT:I must add that after the first time, the game feels very boring and I am just forcing myself to do the other endings and be done with it. I will not thumb down it, but this game is bad.			"

Recommended,36,"																*** Anime Fashion Souls **** Addendum belowI'm not really an anime fan by any stretch, but I do like the visual style at times. The character design here goes above and beyond any creation tools I have seen. You can spend hours just fussing with your character. All the parts make sense and fit well together, and you are bound to find things you like. I reminds me of the fun I had making countless characters in many playthroughs of the Saints Row series, but many times better. The NPCs and enemies look great, too.I am a Dark Souls fan, and went through all of them. If you watched some friends play Souls, and wanted to ""Git Gud"", but failed, Code Vein is a great option. It does have some difficulty, but not near as bad as the Souls series. It's more forgiving. Instead of having to ""Git Gud"", the experience is more like ""Gud Fun"". Understanding all the options you have initially can be a bit overwhelming, but just stick with it. You don't have to start a new character because you messed up. You can change things as you go once you get a grasp on the mechanics. This is a good thing, and a well thought out game design choice.To sum it up, it's a more relaxed Souls-like experience that is very pleasant to look at. The sound design is nice as well. I'm kind of burnt out on Souls-like games, and this game is a brilliant change of pace.It's not perfect, however. Level design could have been better. It's marginal and mostly linear. Like I said above, the amount of information you get bombarded with will take a bit of figuring out. The best way to figure it out, is just to keep playing. There's no penalties I can see for building your character. You don't have to allocate points. Level ups just increase stats automatically as you go. You can then fine tune as you go by choosing equipment.The story? Well, it's anime cartoon. It's passable, and has a certain charm to it. It all comes together and works. It's no Witcher III, but thank goodness it's not terrible like Monster Hunter World. I haven't seen anything really cringe worthy.So if you are looking for something different, and don't want to suffer like you would in a true Souls-like game, this may be just what you are looking for. Combat is fun and can be quite varied once you learn the ropes. Code Vein borrows aspects of a tried and true formula, but also dares to try new things. For the most part, it succeeds. With a bit more polish, it could develop into one of the best franchises.*AddendumAfter playing many more hours, I would like to comment further on the level design. I've really grown to like it. The design is pretty basic at first, and gets far more complex later. While not as intricate as the first Dark Souls, it's similar. You will find doors and ladders to open shortcuts. The level design is maze-like and full of discovery and hidden spots. Be sure to look for areas to drop down. The variety is also nice, and the areas are quite nice to look at. They are colorful and fun to explore. Enemy placement will keep you on your toes.From what I can see about standard review sites, not mentioning any names, this game seems to be underrated. The graphics alone are worth the price of admission. Colorful and vibrant is generally not a part of Souls-like games. The combat is also better, especially once you learn the tricks.It's a 4 star game out of 5. For me, it borders on 4 and a half stars. This is due to the fact that I find it relaxing to play, and it doesn't punish you relentlessly for trying to play it. It isn't a cakewalk, but if it were more difficult, it just wouldn't fit the overall feel of the game.			"

Not Recommended,33.1,"																it is a perfectly made matured game after their success in Dark Souls.Difficulty is way more balanced. You have teammates and they play well. You can count on them even if sometimes you do nothing and keep dying, they can do their jobs.Unlike most other games I played, either the damage of you teammates are heavily nerfed, they can do nothing except to draw a little attentions from your enemies, or you have to order your teammate something, more or less, to tell them what to do, which makes it eventually still you who are controlling the both characters. But in this game, they will sit and watch if they think you can handle the situation, they use skills to kill enemy instantly to protect you if you are about to be hit if they don't do something.  AI is very well designed. good gameIt's a game for someone who like anime and someone who don't want to die too many times but still willing to have challenges.Only one problem, map White Cathedral is too complex compared to the rest, very hard to find a way out.PS:use a controller if possible.

Recommended,12.9,"																Code vein is an amazing game. The balance of the difficult enemies against the easy to learn but hard to master playstyle matches well for this souls-like game.Now before i get started. Is it really a Souls-Like x Anime. Yes, but the difficulties are kinda mixed. On one hand, the standard difficulty is very nice balancing till you get into higher levels and maxed gear, especially New game+. Which is different compared to Dark-souls.There is two different versions of New game+. There is the standard new game +. which doesn't increase difficulty to the enemies but it lets you use normal weapons. New game + Enhanced is where the difficulty gets cranked up. And i mean really cranked. In NG+ Enhanced 1, All bosses can and will 1-2 shot you. which makes the game much harder, trying to perfect how to take on the bosses. You don't damage as much as you did in NG+ standard where you can 1 hit kill enemies up to a certain point and kill bosses under 30 seconds. Instead in the starting area, at level 243, maxed out gear, it takes 3-4 hits to kill a monster, which is fine, that's how it feels like through the first play through.Now into Pros and Cons:Pro:+Character Customization: Now i spend Hours upon hours creating characters and perfecting the looks. I have spent close to 40-50 hours working on my character. One of the best customization features in a game.+game play: With the easy to learn difficult to master sword and gun play, you can run through the game and be able to hold your own. But One wrong step the game can and will punish you. And oh god does it punish you badly.+Graphics: What can i say, This game is beautiful. from the slight effects from swords all the way up to the explosions. its soo pretty. :D+great levels: The levels are all mixed up from a cave up to a maze of towers. you will never see the same place twice in different maps.Cons:-Useless NPCs: Now out of all the play through i have done so far, The NPCs are useless. If you ever pick one, go with Yakumo or IO. Never pick anyone else. (even then i wouldn't really look at Yakumo.) Whys that? Well if you die, Alot of the time the NPC will stand there like a stale bottle of piss. Not bothering to revive you. or they decide that they are the strongest thing in the world. Run in and instantly die. Looking at you Louis..... >_>-Lack of clothing: Now yes, i did say the customization is amazing. But one thing that does annoy me is the lack of clothing. Instead of picking a top with a different pair of pants/skirt, you get a set amount of outfits already made. you can take off some accessories from the outfit. but you cant change the main parts of the outfit.-Tower and DLC depth always on Enhanced mode: Now I'm fine with enhanced, but there is people out there that cant do enhanced due to the difficulty curve it implements, Because of that issue, it puts people off from enjoying the experience of the DLC or the rewards from the tower.There is many things that i would love to see implemented, like a community hub within the game. where you can join to talk to other players and in general hang out. But this game isn't designed for multiplayer except Co-op. Despite what people say about the DLC as well, it is quite fun to learn and feel the accomplishment of unlocking the new weapons/AI outfits. Now i will say, This game is a Souls-Like game, but at the same time, it is different, I cant really compare the game to Dark Souls due to the different approaches.The builds that you create for the game is very difficult to understand, and going into enhanced, you need to have a good working build, otherwise you will have big issues.Overall, I give the game a 9/10. If they added in the option to mix different outfits and improve the AI more, it would be a 10/10. Either way, I love this game.			"

Recommended,43.9,"																Code Pain: The Insufferable, a game so almost good it’s painful surprisingly manages to somehow feel dated after only two and a half years after its release. Like I hinted at in my opening, this game is insufferable, every fifteen minutes of gameplay you are forced to watch a five minute cutscene that just when you think you can finally start playing again you get hit with a ten minute cutscene. I can't understand why they just didn't make an anime if they're gonna force me to watch a whole season anyway before I get to the next level.  It’s an absolute travesty to say the least, and completely feels like it's all just padding, at its core you're only going to be actually playing the game for about three to four hours, but the cutscenes alone add an additional three hours onto that game time per playthrough. It seems like an exaggeration but it really isn’t.  That said, when you are indeed playing the game, the gameplay is pretty good all things considered, it offers a rather tastefully unique mix between NieR and Dark Souls and lets you customise your arsenal to your will. A range of playstyles are encouraged however, but you can just about make anything viable so long as you are willing to stick with it enough. From what I can gauge, the soundtrack is pretty damn good, you have some great orchestral pieces in here which do add masterfully to some of the boss fights you will be engaging in, but unfortunately none of them are really all that memorable. Worse still I can say the same about some of the level design. Though the art style and level design are very pronounced and refined, they clash with the game itself, what I mean by this is you can have some absolutely visually stunning areas like the Cathedral and the Provisional Government Centre, but these areas are unfortunately rather lacklustre, bare, and worst of all linier more often than not.   I’d be able to ignore this for the most part if there was even a hint of variation in enemies or level design tropes but it all plays, looks and feels same-y, from beginning to end. Overall you've got a pretty decent 6/10 game here at its core, but due to the games complete insistence and reliance on cutscenes, tropes and boring characters, it is ruined and probably should be marketed as an anime show instead. Due to this, I have to fundamentally dock this to a 5/10, I would only recommend this if you are buying this on sale for no less than 75% off, spending any more on this game is quite frankly a terrible decision.

Melee combat is clunky and hitboxes are so bad that I was never using 3rd and 4th attack of my combo since they were never connecting with the enemy even when I was right in front of them. Cutscenes keep interrupting the gameplay which gets annoying really fast. There still a lot of little things here and there but overall it's a bad game, probably the worst souls-like I've ever played so far and I played a lot of them. The only good thing I can think of is maybe the amount of magic spells and boss fights. Non of boss fights were memorable but at least there were a lot of them.			"
Recommended,28.3,"																I never played any Souls-like game or even Dark Souls. But I decided to give this one a try, because I actually got interested in it after watching the trailers and even after its release, I also watched gameplay on YouTube and what people thought of this game. And boy, is it good.I won't get into much detail and I'll keep this review as spoiler-free as possible (I hope).For the time I spent playing this game, I actually enjoyed overall the plot of the story and the gameplay. I think the tutorial is pretty much straightforward and it teaches you the fundamentals of the game and what you need to know (it's not that hard, trust me).Besides the gameplay and the story of the game itself, this game also includes (what I think it is) a very complete character creation studio/menu, with lots of different options to choose from and a really good and passionate soundtrack.			"
Recommended,60.7,"																Quick thoughts of Code Vein and its individual parts.For those of you who just want the straight input without the fanciness. (my excuse for making a bad review)Story is pretty forgettable, but there's a lot of it if you're into that sort of thing. I do suggest giving the cutscenes a chance before skipping, because even though I skipped through a majority of them after finding displeasure in watching a mediocre anime for 30 minutes, some cutscenes were pleasant and added to the characters. I guess go with a pick and choose approach if you're not a fan. Some characters I enjoyed more than others and thus dedicated a little time into getting to know them a bit better.The combat while at first clunky (I remember back to when I was fighting a boss that kept missing me because his sword swung too high and thinking ""you too, huh? I get it homie."") grew on me after I experimented using no abilities at all. Mastery of the combat makes everything much more fun. It can still feel a little odd at times, but like in most souls-like games, dodging matters.Speaking of combat, the enemies are... Interesting. Some are weaker than tissue paper, some straight up had me like PikachuFace with how fast they ended me. I enjoyed the variations in how enemies attacked as well. All fun, but what wasn't fun was the bosses. They often died too quick and I found myself really disappointed with the majority of bosses. One fight for example (minor spoiler)  had two phases, which got me really hyped up, however if you lose the fight even once, the boss only has a single phase. This soiled the experience for the partner I played with after I mentioned this since I beat it the first time, and they did not. Bosses can be more difficult depending if you go solo, or change up your build, which is what a few people within the community told me to do, however I always use the tools given to me and don't really enjoy nerfing myself to gain difficulty.Quick mention for the branching pathways. Its a souls-like trait I haven't seen spread to many other souls-like games (only Hollow Knight comes to mind), but it was fun to see here and gave personality to the adventure.The soundtrack for this game I actually really enjoyed, the subtle piano I've heard is pure bliss. The visuals are great, although more because they're somewhat unique rather than anything revolutionary. I enjoyed the style of abilities and different attacks, as well as enemy design which I thought looked bland from trailers, but was decently varied throughout the game (as well as locations).Voice acting. This one doesn't need too much explanation. Sub is always better. The English voice acting fell flat many times compared to the Japanese version, which is often the case. However, its an option if you prefer to listen to dialogue rather than read it. Assuming you don't speak Japanese.Now the real juicy stuff. The character customization. Its fun. Its enough where I have been able to donate at least a couple hours of my playtime to that alone. The pretty look of the characters with the amount of options makes creating characters a blast. One thing I didn't like though was the ""cap"" on accessories. Some cost more slots to wear than others, meaning you could be stuck with 2 accessories rather than 8(? I honestly, forget). I didn't really understand the reason for this. If there's optimization issues fixated to accessories, or if they just wanted to stop folks from making a giant hairball of a character, I'm not sure, but being free to customize is always preferable. OverallI had a fun time with this game. I'm still coming back for more as I haven't finished the game yet since my partner and I are playing back and forth between our games.If you're looking for a fun dark souls coop experience, this might scratch that itch. I had a bit of trouble mastering the controls to begin with (I definitely suggest using a controller, although my partner had no qualms with kb&m), but after this it was smooth sailing for better or for worse. Environments are pretty to see and the coop was enjoyable and even silly at times. Although the game may not be too difficult, the combat is fun to experiment with and see what works for you. To sum it all up!TL;DR - This is not your dark souls replacement. While there are many similarities, this game has a different feel in combat, and in the world you explore. The coop is fun, and if you have no friends the game supplies you with one. If you're an edgy solo wolf there's that too. The highlights of this game are the weird abilities you can use, multiple endings, a gorgeous character creation, and the selling point of the game   the hot springs, where you can stare at your scantily dressed waifu. They didn't forget the dudes either if that's your thing.[Sidenote: I had some issues with my Xbox One controller making the game drop in FPS quite significantly. Updating the controller driver (search on this pc) fixed this issue which originally had me wanting to refund the game. I'm sure a very small minority of people will face this issue, if any at all, but I'm dropping this here in case it helps somebody.]EDIT: I wanted to add some cons here as well to make sure everyone knows what they're getting into.Cons: The game does of course have some bugs. I have turned invisible and gotten stuck in place, had enemies freeze in place, fps drops, game crashing. Though, these events have been very rare with only 3 of the 5 happening to myself only a few times. Combat can be irritating at times, mostly in the beginning. Swings that should have hit in any other game don't, abilities felt cumbersome to use at times, and the punishment this game gives for dying felt tacked on at times since getting haze (the games currency) isn't that difficult.  As I've said, bosses are not too difficult and quite bland. There's a couple of exceptions, but don't expect Dark Souls level quality when encountering your first boss. This one might be nitpicky, but I found myself a little disheartened with some of the weapons/armor. Not for being lackluster, or anything, but more often than not, the armor/weapon I liked, didn't pair well with my class. This is a very minor grievance for me though, as I just went fashion souls despite losing points in some areas.And I think that about does it. Despite some cons, I had a lot of fun with the game, and if you don't mind Code Vein not being an exact clone of Dark Souls, then you'll probably enjoy it as a similar, yet unique experience.			"

Recommended,31,"																I am 32 years old.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you.			"

Recommended,61.6,"																My wife bought me this game at my request that we give it a try for giggles. The pair of desperate spouses we are, foaming at the mouth for every opportunity to find a game we can play cooperatively. After several years of Dark Souls, Salt and Sanctuary, etc as well as what few CRPGs allow us to play with one another we're starting to hit the very bottom of the barrel.I had been told by my circles that Code Vein is an insufferable experience layered with labyrinthian level design, clunky combat, and waifus out the ass, and as such I had ignored it until now during Covid in the midst of what feels like the imminent collapse of society when my wife and I decided ""lets buy a bad game and laugh at it"". Mercifully the people I know who are detractors of Code Vein were perhaps exaggerating or could not look past the excessively anime exterior. I would liken the game to a very strange mix of Dark Souls, with the basic concepts of health, stamina, combat rolls, etc and Prototype of all things, with it's blood code system enabling a very comfortable level of customization to one's play style.The visuals are dated and the style is beyond over the top, which is regrettable, had the creative team exercised a bit of restraint in the way they designed their armory and cast of characters they could have been truly memorable rather than falling away into a confused, samey, over complicated mess. It's like an AI was trained on Bloodborne, and Kingdom Hearts to determine an algorithm for character greebling. The story is positively the most rubbish anime shlock which rouses emotions in me only because I am a loser who finds overused anime tropes endearing and anyone who enjoys something like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcs of FATE will probably also enjoy the narrative here. The combat however is fresh, and I feel remiss that the development of this game was troubled preventing it from realizing it's full potential, despite that it still is incredibly satisfying and filling someone full of bloody swords summoned from your coat tails doesn't ever really stop being cool.The game is deserving easily of an 8/10 because despite all of it's lackluster elements it manages to be consistently engaging, with a well thought out world (despite the narrative chosen to take place in it), and thoroughly enjoyable combat and customization. If it's on sale, or you're given it as a gift, it's well worth a try.			"

No regret Pure looty - dungeon - leveling goodness I also love customisation and fashion in games , this game is awesome for that. I bought deluxe :)			"
Not Recommended,6.4,"																When i first tried the demo on ps4 i really liked and skipped the story so i can wait till the game is released.The game is not the trying to be a soul-like game it's a pure soul game, but not that hard like a dark souls 1 or 2, but still a pretty good game.Pros:- I like the thing when oyu not specializing to one class and you can change your style when or where you want. (There was some boss where i needed to change my style)- You can unlock skills for other classes and there some uniqe skills which you can use in all of the classes which was good.- You can unlock 12 dungeon and some of it easy to find and some of it you need to do side questing and you can get bonus xp items and memories.- The whole memory unlock mean you can deepen emotional connection with the other characters.- Unique bosses with stories  and it can change your ending how you interact with them. - The map, when you can see where you went and how big is the stage it was pretty good.- The character customization was brilliant, where you can make the character that you want.Cons:- For me the biggest mistake is the co-op, because you can do it easier than in dark souls, but i thought you can play almost every aspect of the game with them, but it turns out you can only do stages until beating the bosses.- For me the 20-25 hours first playthrough time is bit of weak for me, i hope if they continue this game it will get better or a bit harder.- Few glitch and bug.This is only my opinion, but It could be so much better if you could play it with friends without doing the same stage twice and it could be a good singleplayer and a full co-op game.In my opion the game could get a 9/10.

Recommended,108,"																This game was fun for a little bit. It has a ""Souls"" feel, though the weapon system is not nearly as dynamic. The customization is also something that is limited. Basically if you are wanting to play a ""Souls"" like game that is a bit more simplistic then this would be a good fit. If you were looking for that challenge and the diversity, this may not be the game for you. I so badly wanted to love this game, Anime and Souls, win-win. Well I was wrong. There is a lot of flash, but not a lot of meat behind the story. Though one could argue that there is no story in ""Dark Souls"", I would respond with you are right and you are wrong. There is an unbelievable amount of lore, but there is little to none hand holding story in Dark Souls. CODE VEIN does have a story, though the story just didn't connect with me.These are the pro's and cons for me.Pro's:Challenging (Dark Souls like)Graphics (special animations)Has a storyFast PacedCon's:Limited Weapon animationsLimited customizing; outfit, weaponsWeak StoryBecomes redundant rather quickly			"

There are lots of viable builds that be be swapped at any time.  Story and world are engaging with cool anime graphics and fully voiced characters. Gameplay is difficult, but rewarding. Bosses are uniquely designed.  Can be played solo, with an AI companion, and/or with another player.Cons:Co-op requires both players to complete an area as host, before moving on to the next area. For example, if you host a game with your friend and beat area A together, you can move on to area B, but your friend cannot until they also host and complete area A. This means if you want to co-op the entire game with a friend, at least one of you must complete each area twice. Some areas can be confusing and frustrating to navigate at times. 			"
Recommended,70.5,"																My reaction to Code Vein is mixed, but overall positive. The plot is interesting (if a bit safe) and full of likable (if not a bit one-dimensional) characters. The story is a cut above the standard for this genre, told through a variety of mediums including fully-voiced cutscenes, walking simulator-esque vignettes, and item descriptions. There is much more emphasis on telling a coherent story than one would expect from a ""souls-like"", and that is one of the game's greatest strengths.Character customization, in both appearance and playstyle, is a thing of wonder in this game. The character creator provides an absurd level of customization, in everything from hairstyle/color to accessories and item placement. Colors may be chozen from dozens of options, including metallic sheens and glowing neons. It is very detailed. That said, there are limited clothing options and all of them are very, VERY anime. Hopefully this is amended in the upcoming DLC.What is not limited, however, is your suite of abilities. Each class (there are more than 25 of them) provides a series of passive and active abilities that you may select and place onto your actionbars. What is unique, and really makes the game stand out, is that once you have ""mastered"" an ability, through slaying enough enemies with it equipped, or utilizing a rare item drop, that ability is unlocked to be used on any other class. By the end of the game, you will be a juggernaut of your favorite abilities, slinging spells from a half-dozen different classes or utilizing passives and buffs to become an unstoppable close-combat machine. This feels very good, and your progress is very tangible and recognizable. Easily the best aspect of the game.Now for a few of my complaints. Some of the enemies, particularly ""lost invasions"" and boss encounters, feel overtuned relative to the rest of the game. Not that anything here is excessively difficult, but expect some significant difficulty spikes that can feel a bit cheap and sudden. My game crashed twice in my 42 hour playthrough, which is certainly not somewhere you want to be in your ""push exploration, how far can I go before I need to save- oh woops I lost an hour of progress"" ARPG.Many disparaged the game's environments, calling them samey or unremarkable. To each their own, I felt that there was as much environmental variety as necessary. Non-boss enemies, however, fall into some very identifiable categories. This isn't necessarily a ""bad"" thing, but do not expect to run into something like a Dark Souls basilisk or Bloodborne zoidberg... thing and not know what to do. You will see sword guys, hammer guys, dagger guys, shield guys. Sometimes they will be different colors, or on fire, but they are what they are and after the first level you know what they are going to do, for the most part. Those complaints aside, I would handily recommend the game to any fans of the genre. Given the relatively low difficulty, I would even recommend it to those interested in the ARPG genre who have yet to give it a whirl. It makes use of many souls-like staples, despite blooming into something unique and interesting. Given full context, it is a miracle that a game this competent came out of a year-long delay from a relatively small studio that frankly hasn't put out anything innovative for nearly a decade.			"

Not Recommended,19.5,"																Code Vein is a game made by Bandai Namco Entertainment with a Soulsborne vibe. Many people describe it as Anime Souls, which is very understandable description from my experience of the game. If you're just looking for something to act as a replacement for the Soulsborne games until Elden Ring is out or if you're interested in a Dark Souls type of game without having to deal with invasions, then Code Vein is something for you.I had been excited for Code Vein ever since Bandai announced it in 2017 and once I finally got my filthy paws on it, I played it non stop until I saw every ending. The story of Code Vein is quite anime-esq and there's three different endings (Good/Neutral/Bad). It's set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been destroyed by a calamity known as ""The Great Collapse"" and humanity is close to extinct. The only thing to be done is weaponizing the dead, turning them into some sort of vampire called 'Revenant' to fight the monsters threatening the remaining humans.You, the protagonist, is a revenant with a special power; you can change your Blood Code while everyone else has one specific to themselves. Together with other revenants and the mysterious girl Io, you fight against The Lost who are revenants that have succumb to their bloodlust to try and find the source of blood beads and hopefully find a way to help the world find the path to restoration again.The character creation is massive and I personally spent hours in it, playing around and creating multiple different character designs that I used for my NG+ playthroughs. What makes it so good is the customisation. Instead of only choosing between different hairstyles and colours, you can add bangs, pigtails, ponytails, hair extensions, and of course hair accessories in general. An article even mentioned that there's nearly 500 eyebrow options, so they've clearly put a lot of work into this. The only slight disappointment is that there's not a lot of options for clothing, but even then you can still customise them in different ways by removing and adding specific details. There's a lot of fan-service for the female clothing, but they're still really nicely designed. Another nice thing is that the Blood Veil system adds to the clothing options. So for example you can have a jacket casually draped over your shoulders or maybe a cool scarf wrapped around your neck.The combat system is very similar to the Soulsborne games, though some blood codes are probably closer to Bloodborne than Dark Souls since it's all about parrying and dodging. There are no shields but you can block with your weapon. There's all kinds of different builds to try in Code Vein and you can change your build thanks to the Blood Codes changing your stats instead of you having to manually choose where to put your attribute points when leveling up. That way you can try out different builds and find something that fits your personal style.Overall Code Vein is an amazing game and probably my personal Game of the Year 2019. I would highly recommend it and have already suggested it to many of my friends, who all appear to be enjoying it too.			"

Not Recommended,71.5,"																Let me start by saying I greatly look forward to a Code Vein 2 that hopefully builds off the cool innovations and world this game sets up. Setting aside whether you like anime or not, this game's really cool ""blood code"" progression system isn't enough to save it from extremely monotonous levels full of copy/paste enemies strewn about winding, tight corridors. You may feel the urge to ask, ""but doesn't Dark Souls have those problems too?"" Sure, but it's really kicked up to 11 here. I mean most levels are literally straight hallways lined with predictable monster closets, and they're all the same brown and tan color pallet that would feel at home in a mid-2000's Xbox 360 shooter. None of these levels really force you to change up your playstyle, nor do the enemies, who only pose a threat when ganking you in large mobs. It's not by any means a terrible or unplayable game, I just have better things to do with my time.			"

The enemies and environments are boring and reused.  It's not necessarily a bad game, but there's really nothing compelling about it to warrant buying or playing it.  There are a lot of Soulsborne-esque games that fail to live up to the original titles they're aping but are still enjoyable enough to play.  This is not one of them.  Feels like a rushed title with a very low budget.  The fact that this is being sold at $60 3 years after release is absolutely bizarre, especially considering $60 was probably their entire budget for making it.			"

Recommended,7.8,"																Played through the entire game with a friend, the coop mode is not only very one sided with progress only saving for one person but is also very weird with how it works in general, with the game kicking your partner after you complete a boss but allowing you to instantly invite them back anyway in 80% of cases.The game itself is absurdly inconsistent regarding content with things such as meeting the same enemies at the end of the game that you would at the start with very *very* minor changes physically as well as inconsistent map design across the board. Sometimes you'll have decent areas such as ones at the very start of the game which aren't too complicated but provide enough visual pleasure to keep you entertained, and other times you'll have something like the Cathedral (a series of white hallways and towers which will take you at least an hour to navigate if you know where to go) or the City of Falling flame (which houses some *mandatory* hallways that drain health at a staggering pace).The bosses are nothing to write home about, and as my first proper 'soulslike' we managed to defeat almost all of them in 2-3 attempts save for the Cannoneer and Blade Bearer which was the worst difficulty spike I've ever experienced, and an awful experience all around. Most of the bosses don't have unique music and their moves are rarely telegraphed well, some even being able to chain 2 or 3 attacks without you being able to react or move away or swinging to hit you and you taking the damage half a second later (which was not due to latency, it was the same on both sides and even solo).Basically, everything after the Cathedral is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game goes steeply downhill. Even the controls are a little inconsistent and janky and with staples in similar games such as iframes being nonexistent, bosses and even base enemies can stunlock pretty easily. Go play Dark Souls instead.			"

Recommended,130.8,"																There are a lot of things wrong. The level design. The plot. The boss design. Enemy variety. Instead of focusing on the multitude of errors though I'm going to talk about the middling errors that, to me, are just too silly to not talk about. Minor spoilers.The plot begins with revenants scavenging to survive in a post apocalyptic wasteland. Easing the suffering of these revenants is the main groups focus for much of the game. However, the presumably multitude of scavengers around are never seen or mentioned again after the second area except for one of the very last cutscenes.Yakumo straight up pulls a glock on one of them in an early cutscene. This is the first time in the game a revenant uses modern firearms. It's also the last time.In the same cutscene the revenant sees Louis' ""Crimson Blade"" and runs away scared. Why he was scared or why Louis' blade means anything is never talked about again.  The masks are a sort of relevant reason to the plot to keep revenants safe but it's such a weak excuse we're moderately convinced it was just a device so lip syncing could be kept at a minimum.During backstabs your character loses the mask to summon a new one from their armor just for the animation. It even happens during a cutscene. But it's not permanent and can't be used to protect you from miasma...? Because... Reasons?There's an AMV fight scene between the party and another character. It's hilarious.Revenants were made as immortal fighters for an outside evil. Despite this there's a child revenant running around. It's never explained why he was made one.Revenants can only truly die when struck in the heart or if they get turned into lost from lack of blood/inhaling miasma. Despite this the memories have a ton of heroic last stands by NPCs to protect other characters. How did they know this would be their last fight? They've died plenty of times before, why is this last stand so special?The side quests are visiting old areas to talk to NPCs and then either kill something or find something for them. They offer minimal information on the world around them and have no real relevant rewards. I don't know why they were made except to hide depth maps.Depth maps are rehashed enemies, bosses, and level assets from previous areas. Aside from a couple vestiges there's nothing unique in them and you don't even have to clear them to get anything. You could ignore the bosses and lose nothing of value. Except...Late there's a boss that's reminiscent of Ornstein and Smough but it's poorly executed and lacks a second phase when you drop the first one. The depth's version of the fight has this feature though where the surviving boss full heals and gets the fire/ice powers of the dead one and has a revamped move set. Why was this cut from the game and hidden in a depths?Blood codes are your classes and you can master most skills in them for use in other classes. Excellent design. But the mastering rate is related to the enemy level and your level and it's possible to make the mastering rate 0. Then skills can only be mastered by farming consumables unless you intentionally hold back leveling. It holds back fun for no real reason. The girl you start the game with (you know the one) says she has her clothes torn because she was attacked and isn't a very good fighter. Later, it's revealed there's actually a ton of her running around and they all have the torn outfits. They are also, plot wise, all very capable fighters. The reason why there's so many of her is addressed. How they came to be really isn't. You fight one of them as a boss but the fight is such a joke it makes me wonder if it was a concept for NPC invaders that just got scrapped and put as a boss to still use the design space. It's one of the two and a half revenant fights in the game. The other one and a half are the first half of the first boss, and a trials boss that is just two of them. Oh no. Double trouble.One of the last bosses has a grey and white checkerboard behind his head. It's so out of place I'm moderately confident it's a missing texture.I haven't the foggiest idea what focus does and I really do not feel like I'm missing out on anything by not knowing.Fortunately a lot of the game is really easy. Things really start to break down when it gets hard though. Sometimes your allies don't rez. Sometimes you rez your ally but then the boss slides across the arena at Mach 6 and finishes you off before your rez animation finishes and you're left wondering what the safe distance was.The game put a lot of effort into character creation but the amount of accessories you can have is relatively low. This disappoints me because I wanted to run around as an abomination of a snowman. Unfortunately, the limit means I'm a snowman head in a bath towel running around. While acceptable it's definitely not optimal.So yeah. It's not great. Good for a laugh. And could these women put on some clothes on. They'll catch a cold.			"
Recommended,96.3,"																Perfectly mediocre in all aspects...save for character generator, which covers quite a lot of ground with only just decals and simple model attachments.Honestly, I can't even find anything memorable on this game to write about it. It sits at a nearly perfect 5/10 spot - there are no factors that are outright terrible or annoying (save from technical issues maybe), but at the same time there's nothing particularly good or nicely done. Well, except the char gen.The game tries hard to reimplement ""souls-like"" game formula, but falls a bit short everywhere: plain maps; forgettable story, badly paced combat, balance issues... Every single aspect is done pretty okay for a souls-like game, but every single aspect has its issues.In the end, this is another souls-wannabe that you can safely skip. Or play & finish without being annoyed much at the game but also without getting anything memorable out of your playthrough. As I said, it's nearly perfect it its mediocrity. At a decent discount later, it would probably be quite an okay purchase for a Souls fan.			"
Recommended,83.6,"																I rate it 7/10. Worth $15-$30, not $60+ Anime aesthetics, visuals look good.+ Fairly challenging encounters, plenty of enemy varieties and behaviors.+ Interesting variety of map locations+ Robust character creation system+ Game length is pretty decent, about 30-60 hours of content, depending if you take your time exploring.= If you like mazes, this game is for you.= Story was okay, ymmv depending on which ending you get.= Combat was okay, its more of an RPG adventure game than a action game. Combat depth is just learning enemy attack patterns, dodging, countering/blocking, and using special skills.= Co-op is limited in scope, can summon a friend to help you on a level, but ends as soon as anyone dies or the map boss is defeated. Can play the full campaign in co-op, but the joining player won't be able to loot chests.- Poor presentation (Really a missed opportunity given how good the game looks. lacks music, cutsenes are not interesting. Most cutscenes come in the form of slow paced walks through 'memories', listening to statues talk- it's very  boring.)- Maps are not procedurally generated, but they sure feel that way because a lot of map assets are copy-pasted. Worst of both worlds, ruins replayability.- No difficulty selection option, can have swings in difficulty.			"
Recommended,25.6,"																Firstly I did enjoy this game overall because I love my Souls-likes.However, I can't recommend this game.Graphically this game is nice, and the additional companion is a nice touch to change up the game.But there are several issues with the combat itself and the world design.I found with bosses that every boss that inflicted a status effect (at least early on) you don't get the skill to counteract that effect until after the fight (it may just be the way I played but that was my personal experience and it took away from a lot of the bosses).The map design was also awful. Literally one of the levels is just a maze of bridges and platforms which takes about 1-2 hours to get through and it's just not fun.The story is also a mess and wasn't enjoyable. There's several sections in the game where you walk and watch freezeframes and story dialog which takes you out of the game completely (there's a lot of these too).If you want to play a Souls-like there are better ones out there to put your time into.

Recommended,44.5,"																I want to like this game, but it feels like the devs feel otherwise. I will continue to play it in order to get more value out of it and get the remaining joy that it has to offer, however as it stands, the game is a 3/10.Pros:- Souls-Like, not saying it does this well, because it doesn't, but the genre itself is a plus from me.- Flexible Build system, you aren't stuck as the build you've been making throughout your play through. Whenever you feel like it, you can change up your build, experiment and play around doing whatever you like.- Unique ""drain"" mechanic, allowing you to perform some pretty cool attacks for some bonuses.- Graphics. The graphics are pretty good, though it's nothing amazing.Here we go...Cons:- The most intentionally bad multiplayer system I've ever encountered and it is genuinely more frustrating than trying to set up your own server for a game from 2007. If you want to play with a friend, you need to send out a ""distress signal"" with a set password and then your friend needs to ""search for distress signals"" with the same password. Once that happens, you can no longer use certain items from your inventory, you can no longer use mistles, you can not teleport to mistles, if your friend dies, they are kicked and they are required to join again. If you die, they are kicked. If you kill a boss, they are kicked. If you go to scratch your balls, they are kicked. The game likes to orient itself around team work, but punishes you for indulging in it. If you want to play COOP, play on the fastest SSD you have, because you'll be going through a lot of loading screens if you're not the host.- The combat is just bad, like, really bad. It's the same thing over and over again, poor choreographing from enemies, inconsistent timing, iframes just... don't work half the time. This game's version of increasing the difficulty as you go along is just throwing more enemies at you without any thought. The devs seem to be under the impression that the relationship between enemy count and difficulty is entirely linear, which it is not. If you use the lock-on feature (which you'll have to if you want your hits to actually land, but even when it is on, you have to pray for it), you're going to be stunned locked into a corner and your camera will be covered by some 10 foot tall knight.- Terrible bosses. Some of them are fine, but most of them are just stronger versions of existing enemies except somehow even buggier. Queens knight reborn just turns invisible meaning the advantage of information is just taken from you, the only thing you'll know is where they are if you're using the lock-on feature. None of the bosses are particularly exciting either. Skull King is probably one of the easiest bosses in the game, despite it being the (sort of) final boss of the game.- Cut-scenes. The game hates letting you play. 90% of the time you'll spend on this game will be the loading screens from all of the stupidly abundant boring cut-scenes in the game (that you can't disable). I once counted 8 consecutive cut-scenes, all to entertain the boring, generic non-engaging plot. Not only that, but some cut-scenes, that if skipped give you an entirely different ending to the game, preventing you from fighting the final boss. - Hidden statistics and mechanics. This game LOVES hiding as much information as possible while still giving you a little glimpse about the statistics of your character. Instead of using something logical like, say, numbers to represent things, they decided to use letters that have a maximum display value, also meaning that the precision of the stats you are shown are abysmal. If you like min-maxing, this game doesn't like you.- Abysmal level design. The level design of this game is the worse I've ever experienced, and I played hunt-down the freeman (pirated of course). On your first play through, most of the progress you'll make in a lot of levels will be entirely accidental. You will feel not sense of accomplishment or achievement upon reaching the next mistle (if the level is generous enough to give you more than 2). But by far, the worst level I've ever played of any game ever, is Cathedral of The Sacred Blood. Think of a maze, now imagine that maze has vertical levels, now imagine that you have to jump off the sides of walkways to get there, now imagine that you have to make a giant loopty loop around the entire level to get 10 different keys to unlock a single door that leads you to more of the same stuff. The errors of the level design of this game aren't excusable simply for the fact that these poor choices aren't something that can be chalked up to not being a good designer, these levels are intentionally this way, it is a fundamental part of the level itself. Cathedral wouldn't be as bad had it not been the longest level in the entire game and the most boring (you'll find more enjoyment in the training area). The whole level is walking down pathways with the occasional teleporting enemy.- Terrible partner AI. I would rather teach a toddler computer science than spend another minute with these stupid AIs. They make the poorest decisions and play like blind grandmothers. Instead of making careful choices, they just run at the enemy, attack, get hit, die and beg you to sacrifice YOUR HEALTH to revive them.- Refresh rate issues. I play on a 144hz monitor. This game LETS you use a refresh rate greater than 60hz, however the game will drill a screw into its head when you do. So many things break and you will encounter more issues than your money's worth.- Price. This game's price tag is absolutely laughable. If you want this game, wait for a sale, otherwise you will never EVER get your money's worth.- Cringe worthy stereotypical anime stuff, nobody who lives above ground would enjoy it.- Overpriced DLC, the content is alright, but for the price it's nowhere near enough content.

Recommended,66.9,"																RPG + Souls-like = this game.Bought the game when it was on sale. Disappointed at its combat design.If you're expecting a typical souls-like game, don't buy it.Most of time you will just mindlessly spam attacks with your partner.Every 2nd hit will stagger your enemy, which makes it easy to kill them without even giving them a chance to attack.You will just end up consuming all your stamina just pressing one single button to defeat enemies, there is no difficulty in it.Not saying you can do this every time and beat the game easily, it is still a souls-like game and you will need to dodge attacks when they're coming.This game is designed to be played with a partner. With a partner, everything becomes easy. But without a partner, everything becomes unfair and hard because you will see 2 ~ 3 enemies constantly chasing after you and they will dominate you.There is no adequate difficulty between being too easy and being too hard.Boss fight is just a full of unfairness.They will mix you up as if they're playing a fighting game and make you guess what they will do.There is a lack of visual feedback as to what they're trying to do after (or sometimes they just instantly hit you).A boss can hit you with A attack, then follow it up with B attack which comes out fast or C attack which is slow to trick your evasion timing. But there is no distinguishable alert in between the first attack and the second attack. You will need to rely on your luck and prey you're guessing correctly.Even this becomes no problem as long as you make the boss go after your partner and hit them in the back while healing your partner.			"
Recommended,24.9,"																As a Souls-vet, CODE VEIN is... fine. Not amazing, not terrible. It's got some flashes of brilliance, and some flashes of absolute nonsense. Pick it up on a sale, not more than $30.The first thing that stands out is that the combat and game mechanics are incredibly overcomplicated - to the point that it becomes a pretty big detriment to playing it. Furthermore, the combat system doesn't feel suited to fighting multiple enemies at once (at least, with a big 2H weapon) and that's all the game throws at you. There are some major animation and tracking issues with trying to fight multiple, fast moving enemies.Secondly, the game relies heavily on an NPC system that is very neat and fleshed out but results in a game balance that's a bit of a mess. Your ally makes the game both weirdly too easy and randomly out of nowhere way too hard. Playing solo would be an absolute nightmare because every encounter is expected to be handled by you and your ally.That said, I enjoyed how the story and characters took lots of Dark Souls ideas and executed them in a JRPG way - lots of backstories and writing of characters experiencing ""Hollowing"", reacting to the world, each other, and so on. Tons of homage to direct elements in Dark Souls (and to say more would spoil it). The devs were clearly big fans of Dark Souls.A final note about multiplayer - it is annoyingly half-baked. Having an online friend and an NPC ally is confusing so turning the NPC ally off helps, but at the same time you can't do many critical things with having a multiplayer friend in your world, such as: can't rest at bonfires, can't level gifts, can't form story-critical vestiges at NPCs in front of boss walls, can't use Regen Extension items (increase ""Estus flask"" usages), can't replenish heals. It becomes a huge pain having to banish your friend and resummon them for every little thing and really makes you wonder why you bother. Exploring The Depths maps with a friend is the best bet for online co-op, so do keep a guide handy to unlock those as quickly as you can (since they become pointless if you out-level them).			"
Recommended,73.3,"																Sucks. I've played through only a minor portion of the total games' content, but the part that I have played made me not want to continue. Whatever systematic improvements this game might have presented to the souls-like genre are overshadowed by terrible gamefeel and design along with boring visuals/writing. Movement in Code Vein features instant acceleration which ruins the feel, there's no weight to anything. Both the player character and enemies swing around giant weapons like they're twigs. Taking actions feels weird in general due to excessive directional change mid-animation, and awkward ending points to animations. Rolling feels clunky. Hitboxes also feel off, although this is minor.Much of the difficulty outside of bosses seems to rely on throwing groups of enemies at you, forcing you to kite and wait for a moment to strike so you can hit an enemy while not getting hit by another. While not impossible, this is obviously a cheap way to create difficulty and the game would benefit much more from 1-on-1 engagements, which the combat system is designed for. A trap that many souls-likes fall into, unfortunately. Some bossfights were especially frustrating due to status effects that would doom you to certain death. These can be remedied by consumables that take so long to use that you'd get hit in the process and often die anyway.All the visuals are incredibly generic. The environments and enemy designs are not at all original or interesting in any way, with most boss designs not even having any relevance to anything going on in the story or general setting. The weapons are these bulky monstrosities in what I guess is traditional anime fashion, though I can't say I'm a fan. It feels like the designs are a product of piling as much flair onto a hilt as possible without any internal logic or practical use. I think I'd be more okay with it if there was at least some progression to it, but even the grunts at the start of the game drop weapons that, to me, look like boss weapons if they were in any other game.The story looks to be nothing impressive and the writing is laughably bad at times. The premise is your average post-apocalypse with a scarce resource that everyone is after. In this case it's blood, but instead of getting it from other humans (which would probably make for an interesting plot point) people get it from 'blood beads' that grow on white trees. Though seemingly rare, the main cast has no problems doling these out to just about anybody they come across. Bad guys are cartoonishly evil and good characters are just poor victims that want to help eachother as much as possible. None of the expostition, dialogue or memories feel like they're worth sitting through. Obviously I haven't seen all of it, but I have difficulty imagining the quality improving at any point.At least the character creator is good.			"

Recommended,60.7,"																Really enjoyed this game from start to finish! If you like Dark Souls and are a huge weeb on top of that, then this is the game for you.  The story is kind of confusing at times but makes up for it with great characters.  Halfway through the game you'll notice that the enemies are kind of copy-pasted, which is normal in anime games anyway so it doesn't bother me in particular. There's a lot of different ways you can build your character and a ton of different skills and passives to work with, so just go with whatever works for you best! Experimenting with different builds is part of the fun of this game. Code Vein isn't as difficult as the Souls series  but still rather challenging at points, which I appreciated since I don't often do well with high-difficulty games. If want a good intro level souls-like game, then definetely give this a try.The game is a bit short, with a first playthrough taking about ~25 hours depending on how much exploring and side quests you do. There is NG+ with a lot of your stuff carried over as well as the option to increase enemy difficulty or keep it the same, which I found nice.  There is a good bit of replay value here, and I'm currently on my second play through.Don't bother with DLC, though. It's 10 dollars for about an hour of content that was copy pasted from the main game and a few new items and bosses. Not worth it unless it goes on sale or something.			"
Recommended,54.7,"																So obviously, you're going to compare this to Dark Souls. Yes, there are similarities in how it plays. However, this game does its own thing in a couple ways. The gameplay is based around using abilities and multiclassing. You can switch these on the fly to suit the situation. There are a decent variety of ways to play, accompanied with a neat progression system that unlocks backstory at the same time. The combat takes a mindset of action-first, as tasks like healing and buffing are slow compared to actively attacking. The game isn't too tough, and isn't dependent on grinding unless you want to obtain every ability possible. A lot of the difficulty is offset by the npc companions, but it also seems designed for using them rather than going it alone, as evidenced by all the gank squads. I finished my first playthrough in ~30 hours. However, there are 3 endings and the NG+ difficulty, so I am inclined to replay the game.The story is direct and character-driven. Typically, Souls type games tend to be very secretive with backstory, but here it is played straight. The characters aren't too planted into tropes, and are likable. The ""true"" ending isn't that convoluted to obtain.The soundtrack is where I have a slight problem. The boss music is totally fine, but there is a theme for melancholy situations that gets recycled quite a bit. This somber theme loses its effect the 20th time it's heard.As far as the visuals go, the aesthetics of the game are well done, in my opinion. The character creation is robust and well worth hours of your time creating the perfect girl and/or edgelord. I have the graphics maxed out, and the framerate hardly dips below 60 unless loading a large area. For reference, I'm tunning a GTX 1060 6gb, Ryzen 2600, and 16gb RAM. Overall, Code Vein is neither mindblowing nor mindnumbing. It is solidly above average. I'd say it's worth $40, but I've also never taken so many screenshots for a game.			"
Recommended,27.7,"																 This game will play out in 3 different scenarios: 1) Cutscene -> Cutscene2) Cutscene -> walk 3 steps -> Cutscene3) Cutscene -> Bossfight -> Cutscene As a person who gets carried in every souls-like game, this game is literal baby mode. If you come in expecting that dark souls charm, oh boy you'll get it alright, but don't go expecting nothing more. This is just a dark souls anime/vampire re-skin with cutscenes around every corner, but hey, I'm not complaining, I enjoy this game a lot. More than I should, but what do I know right?

The combat mechanics itself are interesting but it becomes shallow very quickly especially with the uninteresting map designs.

IMO the anime-style fits better with fast-paced action like God Eater rather than the gritty souls-like genre.			"
Recommended,262.1,"																Short version:The systems and mechanics would make this a great game if it wasn't simultaneously trying so hard to be a souls-like. Most of the levels are well designed and intricate, but the lack of enemy variety, occasional unfair encounters, and lackluster reward structure soil any sense of enjoyment. The story and characters are pure anime garbage and the endings are ripped straight out of dark souls. Not recommended unless its cheap on a sale and you're looking for a low quality scratching of your souls-like itch. I'd give it a 4/10. Long version, probably spoilers, just random points: The blood codes and blood veils are interesting twists on stats, but they also make leveling up feel incredibly unrewarding. I feel like they easily could've used a different system for leveling up, but instead this is supposed to be a souls-like, so of course you put your currency into leveling up at bonfires (mistles in this game) instead of any other type of system. Giving characters old world items they like to then buy items from them was a nice system and I wished it was expanded upon further.The layout of some of the levels are outright fantastic, but I found myself dreading exploration as it was only a matter of time before I would come across another lost invasion, which is possibly the hardest content in the game while also managing to be the most unfun. The rewards are never worth trying over and over to beat them, and after the first 3 I didn't bother retrying the later ones once I inevitably died to them. But again, the levels are very well designed and I enjoyed the amount of shortcuts and reusing mistles, it gave a nice feeling of completing areas. The depths are at first enjoyable side content, but they get quickly repetitive and reuse areas, enemies, and bosses, as well as the same structure and objective every time. There seemed to be some amount of potential in them but like most of this game the potential is wasted. Also, side characters such as the ""self-important revenant"" are terrible and feel incredibly forced to try to copy dark souls.This game is praised for its character creator but I would only somewhat agree. It's near impossible to make a female without having your base clothing choice show off your chest which is the norm for nearly every female character in the game. Most of them either wear way too revealing clothing, or have shirts that wrap around their chest like its perpetually wet and unrealistically wraps around their skin. I'm sure you can probably cover yourself with the extra customizations you can do on top of your base clothing, but I would still have liked to see choices to have less revealing clothes and more realistic body options, and as it is currently it just makes the game feel like little more than cheap anime pandering. Also, good luck making a character that looks older than 16 without attaching bangs and ponytails to your face to look like a glued on beard. I've heard this game be praised for its bosses, and again I have to disagree. Some of them are visually interesting, but thats about it. The Butterfly of Delirium is probably the best boss in this game, and gives you hope that the later bosses will follow suit in quality, but they sadly do not. Because they wanted every boss to have a difficulty spike at 50% HP, every boss is incredibly easy before that threshold, and essentially most bosses only actually start at 50%. Even then, a lot of them only get slightly more challenging, and if you've played a souls game prior to this, you will likely first try a good amount of bosses. As well, every boss is fought in an easy to identify big circle on your map, so they quickly start feeling like cookie cutter inclusions, rather than being integrated into their area. And of course this game had to have an Ornstein and Smough being the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer, and they're one of the most unfun fights in the entire game. To make this game more difficult I never played with companions, and I can still confidently say this game is too easy. I cannot imagine how easy this game would further become with companions to draw aggression and deal damage. Blade Bearer and Cannoneer gave me some troubles solo because of how quickly cannoneer can damage you from across the area, but once I started using ice and fire defenses the fight became substantially easier. My favorite boss was the Successor of the Breath, mostly because of his design. The story felt very forced and was quite terrible. The characters are typical anime stereotypes and the player rarely speaks, leaving you with close to zero choices in the story. It is admirable that all of the cutscenes seemed to be rendered in-game, but this also resulted in a lot of awkward delivery of dialogue and underwhelming moments. A balance of in-game and pre-rendered would have been preferable but I'm sure there are budget reasons why they ended up not doing that. Also the endings felt like cheap copies of dark souls 1, either ""sitting upon the throne and perpetuating the cycle, or ending the cycle once and for all."" You can apply that quoted synopsis to either of the two games. I know dark souls doesn't make their endings as clear cut which is good and which is bad as code vein does, but they're still incredibly similar. All in all, I think this game could have benefited greatly in distancing itself from borrowing souls-like mechanics and instead trying to establish its own identity. Instead, its an unenjoyable mess of terrible anime writing and a needlessly unoriginal dark souls clone.			"

Recommended,16.3,"																 Quick Note If you are expecting an epic adventure on a dark fantasy world like dark souls... you're not going to find it here, the story can get super cheesy and annoying, and it screams ""ANIME!!"" everywhere. That being said, the gameplay is definetly souls like, and it's interesting enough to be worth a try if you love the souls formula.Be wary, DLCs are just an extra dungeon with some added items, and not a whole new area with an interesting story.An anime dark souls, that doesn't feel like a blatant copy (most of the time).This is a game that's hard to recommend to anyone that is not fond of the souls mechanics. The game itself is definetly an ""anime game"" (big tits, lots of style and all the drama), which might make it hard to recommend to a souls fan as well, so it's sitting on a weird spot. The gamplay is mostly like a souls game: you have to manage your stamina, you have your fast, mid and fat roll, you can parry and backstab, and whenever you die you are sent to the previous bonfire (and if you die without recovering your stuff you lose it forever); and yet, this game doesn't have the same feel of dread and misery that all the souls have on them. There are many differences from the souls formula that might keep away the most hardcore souls fans:You have an NPC partner, and while you can leave them behind and go solo, the game was planned for this duo gameplay; your ""Estus"" sucks ass (it doesn't heal as much) and you will get the best healing methods by the time you reach the end game, so until then it's not a wise choice to go solo.There is no stats customization, your ""build"" depends on what you have equipped, so if you were planing to make a faith Havel Monster you're out of luck.While you lose your ""souls"" if you die a second time without recovering it, you have the option to go to the hotsprings and relax, which will give you back half of them without having to go and pick them up from where you died. These hotsprings also help kill the frustration and fury from your deaths and failures, so that's something it has that souls games don't.THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PVP, so again, you don't have to worry about being invaded by a havel monster or a glass cannon that will definetly rip you a new one.Multiplayer feels half assed, as a host you can ask for help, opening your game for anyone to join anytime and help you, while the sunbros can just select ""join"" and be dropped immediatly into action. Once your host triggers a ""bonfire"" or beats the boss, you're gone; you don't have the usual few minutes to say thanks of goodbye. Also, you can only have one player join your game.You have a minimap. In souls games you usually navigate by using reference points since there's no map available; in here I noticed that the map, while useful to navigate, makes most of the stages forgettable since I ended up paying more attention to the minimap than the level itself.The cutscenes... remember how little cutscenes you had in souls series, and how they didn't get in the way of your gameplay?; as I said before, this is an anime game that demands to tell a story... with lots of cutscenes and special scenarios where you're escentially playing a walking simulator. It can get annoying if you really don't care, but you can skip them.  After going for a NG+, I have to say the story really bothered me, specially with so many cutscenes getting in my way, and here's another thing I liked so much from Dark Souls' storytelling: the story was told by every single one of my actions and choices, while here I have to sit and watch (or say ""f*** it"" and press skip) a cutscene from time to time. Again, taking Dark Souls as an example, I could make a run where I go rogue, kill everyone and don't link the fire, and on my next run do every single character quest and save as many of them as possible, while also doing Oolacile before going for Sif for extra tears... my point is you don't have so much liberty with YOUR story here, and that's mostly thanks to the cutscenes. I don't know how I let this slide, but a lot of the areas are corridors, or better yet, bridges. To it's credit, the game won't let you dodge roll into the abyss, but you can still walk and slip to your death or be thrown by an enemy (when there's no wall to stop you).Remember I said you can't make your build?; well, it seems they figured out a way to ""fix"" this by simply adding the STR, DEX, INT and FTH builds ON THE DLC!!!. If you want to go full str you have to do the DLC and get the damn codes!.Beyond all that, the game plays and feels like a souls game, with all the anime tropes we know. It's quite an awesome mix, and I'm actually loving this game. If you haven't played Dark Souls and don't feel like it, I'd recommend watching a gameplay like Best Friends Play (At the risk of spoiling the experience for you). Then you could see if it's your thing and come play this since it's more frendly with it's mechanics... kind of.Some warnings for the souls players.Ok so this game has a blight town, an anor londo and even a lost izalith, but there are a few differerences to be noticed.Blight town doesn't run like ass, and you won't have your rusted iron ring to carry you through... but your companion should be good enough (and it's also not that hard either, you're not being poisoned by the swamp).Anor Londo has no archers, but it is a maze with different floors, so you will need a lot of patience.Lost Izalith wasn't half assed and actually has a level design (kind of), but your ass will be burnt while exploring it, and you don't have an orange charred ring to cover it.There's also some things to keep in mind gameplay wise:Fast roll is a bloodbourne dodge, mid roll is a DS3 fast roll, and fat roll is a DS3 mid rollYour fastest parrying method compares to a medium shield parry... or maybe a curved sword's; either way, parrying is quite different on it's timing, and each of the ""veils"" you can use have a different parrying window, some even require you to parry way before time.Backstab feels weird with some weapons; most of the times what I do is aim for the right hand side instead of the left hand side (like I used to in dark souls) to get a backstab.All your movesets have hits that can be triggered with sprint button + any attack; and I'm not talking about running attacks, it's more of a hold sprint button and use an attack while standing.Your weapon has a special attack that's done by holding the strong attack (kind of a weapon art).There's tears of denial for you and your companion... have fun.

Bandai Namco Games hired  the gothic toned talented Heather Hogan as a voice actress for the game. she is one of ten options available from you to select from, ironically to my surprise she is the tenth on the list.2. Heather is the voice actress of Soul Calibur fame's Viola, the idol of my affection and the only female character ever across all games to be put on a pedestal.my dedicated Viola fanboy status said, the gameplay is actually good. a mixture between Bloodborne/Dark Souls III and Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen to be specific.the character creation / edit mode is detailed and the dev team just added the height adjustment feature 2 days ago, so now Viola not only sounds like the real her at this point but she's the same exact height (Height5'3"" (161 cm) as of SCV and unknown if given a full retcon on the SCVI reboot as potential DLC later on.) to boot!Code Vein has some flaws, but in my special case it has way too much positives going for it to the point it won the entire decade of the 2010s in one fell swoop one the last year. like a hero.Bandai Namco Games sinned with the curse that is Soulcalibur VI, but they are forgiven with blessed Code Vein.Thank you and well done. Now then. Quickly, Viola awaits! (To be continued for new changes with the Season Pass early 2020.)			"

Not Recommended,1.1,"																It is basically anime dark souls, but toned down so that even the casual player can enjoy without frustration. You can have a companion with you during exploration, so they can help take the heat in a fight. Even if you die, your companion can bring you back with a skill (provided their skill can be activated), which makes it much more forgiving. Save points are relatively near the boss fights, no need to fight through half the map to get there.The character customisation is impressive, though things like gender, height and body type can't be modified after your character is created. You can only modify the appearance and clothes etc. Edit: Though it seems you can load saved characters, so you can effectively make a new game, load the old character, edit it and then open your old game and then load the appearance up. Combat is smooth and feels polished. The game has a few different types of weapons, blood veils and blood codes to use, which allows for many different combinations and play styles. The combat also feels reminiscent of God Eater (Though I still haven't properly played through that game), where you use special moves and your blood veil to consume ichor from your enemies so you can use your skills and special attacks. It's a neat mechanic which forces players to learn to fight rather than spam skills; one must learn to gain ichor in order to use the skills.The game also has an interesting plot where you slowly piece together what happened in the past via unlocking the memories of other characters. The voice acting (Japanese) is also very good. I would recommend this game to people who like the souls-like genre of games.			"

It's hard as hell and can be frustrating at time, but any soulslike game if you can endure and level up and get the good equips and learn the enemy and boss pattern. The character customization is VERY robust and gives a lot of freedom anime style though, but that's the strength of this game you can create your own anime character to fight. Overall this game is a must have and a must buy for any fan of anime style game, but like said at the beginning this game is hard. Also get the deluxe edition so you'll get all the DLC's.			"
Recommended,43.7,"																To be honest i was actually expecting it to be bad, because at first it was so popular just because it's ""Dark Soul-ish but anime"", but surprise surprise it was really enjoyable both gameplay wise and the story, though not that mind-scattering but is still unique and really entertaining. The gameplay is, like how it was popularized before, really works like Soulsborne in many ways but not completely, you can make it easier with the help of companions who will really help you a great deal (though sometimes their AI are really weird like they wont do anything if they have low health and they're in a corner with an enemy, they'll just keep rolling until the enemy is far away or they roll away from them). The way they make blood codes as a base to set your stats is also kinda unique plus the way mastered skills/blood gifts can be carried to other blood codes making it possible to do many combinations between blood codes, weaponry and blood giftsStory wise though its simple, its really enjoyable and fun to watch every cutscene and every vestiges you restored, making the character's background more deep and profound, though some are either lacks more stories since there's only few vestiges or just too flat.Though with all that said there's still a lot of room for improvement, like there's still some bug like one that spawns the enemy from ""Trial of blood"" in a wall (though they can reappear somewhere if you walk far enough so not really a problem), and the NPCs in home base should've converse with each other to make it more lively rather than awkward silence with some edgy music playing in the background (not that i hate it really). In the end, dont take this review too seriously since i've only played it for 20 hours, might change my mind later idk lmao.			"

Recommended,27.5,"																Will attempt to make it as comprehensive as possible, so you know what you're getting into.Visuals - overall good, plus fairly wide range of character customization options, similar to latest God Eater game. Although, even at high graphics settings there are plenty of low res textures - they shouldn't catch your eye much during gameplay.And how can I not mention the thing people seem to care most about in this game... So hate it or love it - jiggle physics is there, plenty of it.Gameplay, follows approach of Dark Souls, with all the usual consequences, so you'll be exploring vivid areas, looking for good stuff and fighting relatively tough enemies, until you arrive to the boss encounter.Aside for ""Soulsborne series"" gameplay basics, Code Vein actually provides plenty of its own:- Classes - ""Blood Codes"" can be earned throughout the game. They determine skills and equipment you can use as well as  character attributes, like HP, Maximum carry weight, Strength, etc. Additional layer of depths to it - ability to easily swap around Blood codes, and even use skills from one Blood Code in another, basically letting you tailor your own class.- Blood Veils - both your armor and your weapon. They incorporate ""Drain"" ability (similar to the God Eater ""feeding"" mechanics), which let you perform parries and backstabs like in Dark Souls, along with some other moves and restore your ""magic"". Also Blood Veils along with Blood Codes govern the effectiveness of your magic abilities, though if you value style over combat effectiveness - you're not loosing much.- Companions. Those certainly help if you're not keen on the whole Dark Souls game mechanics, making things all so much more manageable.Still, there's some issues that as a new player you must consider: game doesn't allow instantly dodge/block while performing other actions, so if you're performing some sort of attack - you're committing until that attack ends.And currently Multiplayer isn't working well, so it might take a bit of tweaks in settings to get it going.Story and characters - overall something akin to your usual adventure cartoon/anime series, so expect some drama, cheesiness, and nice twists here and there. Storytelling takes a mixed approach having part of the story and exposition being told to you, and other part, similar to Dark Souls item descriptions, hidden behind items you collect during your exploration.Music - overall good, enjoyable even. Ranging from nice instrumental themes to occasional heavy metal.So as final verdict - I'd go with easy solid 7/10. It's fairly good game despite niche appearance and some technical issues. Could be 8/10 if you enjoy anime-ish style of visuals and story... And if Namco gets multiplayer working properly.			"

Recommended,10.4,"																I was having a really great time for most of the game - the best character designer I’ve seen, the difficulty felt challenging while still being fair (except the butterfly of delirium, whoever designed that was a sadist who should never be permitted near a video game again),  exploration was a ton of fun (even the cathedral of the sacred blood was enjoyable),  there was a great sense of progression...and then I hit the combo of the Gilded Knight boss and the Silent White Depths dungeon, both of which absolutely killed any sense of enjoyment. Do you enjoy bosses that move twice as fast as you, can kill you in one hit even after you spend six hours level grinding, stun lock you constantly, and because they move so fast they will interrupt literally every attempt to use a healing item? No? No sane human would? Too bad, because that’s what you’re getting. The Silent White has a pair of frankly absurd enemies that buff themselves, move absurdly fast, hit like a truck, and have tons of health. And the gilded knight is the same except worse, being able to basically teleport to interrupt you should you have the gall to try to heal after he lowered you to 1/20 of your max hp in a single hit. Don’t expect your companions to help - they’ll be too busy being stunlocked themselves, or running in the wrong direction. Or worse, they’ll just stand there as you die and look at your corpse until the screen goes black even when they have enough hp of their own to revive you.

Recommended,6,"																I would NOT describe it as anime dark souls. Yes, it has challenging boss fights, yes it has bonfires. But, if you go in expecting ""anime dark souls"" you might be disappointed.TL;DR: Full price, no. Sale, yes.+ Good Story and the ending I got (1 of 3) was enjoyable + Fun Boss Fights (though there are a several pretty annoying run backs if you encounter a skill issue)+ Good Music- Boss aggro weirdness and bot co-op AI are frustrating at times.- Some of the levels are so annoying to traverse that the thought of having to do it again prevents me from attempting another play through. - Use the sprint key (default right bumper) to slide down ladders or climb up them faster.- If you get kidnapped in a closed elevator and it wont move, just alt-tab out then back in, it should start moving. Plot (no spoilers) + Some darn good waifu material, and no shortage of breasts.+ Its a good story from what I know (see next point for explanation) .- The Interactive cutscenes were grueling. Most of the cutsenes are normal: video plays, you watch, lore is learned. However, a not so insignificant number of 'cutscenes' are 'interactive.' The player gets to walk through a level at a snails pace from vignette to vignette waiting for dialog to finish. I understand why thematically why you're forced to walk (see incredibly mild spoiler below), but it would have been so much more enjoyable to just throw up a powerpoint and not make me hold the left stick for two minutes. Your target audience is anime enjoyers. Looking at pictures and reading subtitles is pretty much our forte. You walk through the cutscenes because you're exploring someone's memories, so sure its a neat idea on paper. + There are three endings. My first (and most likely only) play through got the 'neutral' one, it was enjoyable.Boss Fights:+ All of the bosses are fun and challenging, and most of them I enjoyed so much I asked my friend who had already played ""Do I get to fight them again?""- Attacks aren't telegraphed as well as in souls games. As another reviewer said 'the animations feel stiff.' It's not a big deal if you just dodge every scary movement a boss makes, but its much more fun for me to actually recognize attacks and react to them. - Boss aggro switching between the player and your partner feels entirely random. In a specific fight the boss will just dash across the entire arena to target your ally for seemingly no reason whatsoever. Since the aggro is so erratic, it can be quite challenging to know who attacks are targeted towards, which is mind-boggling since the game seems designed around co-op.- Bosses seem to have predefined HP % where they will stagger, instead of it being based off of doing lots of damage in a short amount of time. That's probably not actually the case, but I didn't find a consistent way of triggering a stagger while using a rather large sword, it just felt like I was given one for free each fight around 60-75% HP, and never again. Exploration- Items are spread around each level really well, and the levels do reward exploration. Unfortunately, you'll be fighting the same enemies over and over throughout the zone (and sometimes unavoidable environmental hazards such as the floor is lava!) so the exploration feels more like a chore.- Do you like doors that don't open from this side? Do you like opening up five different shortcuts just to progress to the next bonfire? Do you like the way forward at some points to be obscured at best and down right hidden at worst? Do you like feeling hopelessly lost? Then you'll enjoy every single zone! Ultimately its the level design of the zones that is going to hold me back from another play through. There are far too many zones that I just do NOT want to have to run though again.- What the ♥♥♥♥ is it with level designers and their burning desire to litter maps with ladders and slow-ass elevators? Give me a grappling hook or something to let me get up and down at predefined areas quickly please, I beg of you.			"

Recommended,129.4,"																Given that I loved Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 with all DLC, I thought that I would also like this game.  The fact that I am going out of my way to post a negative review when I never post any reviews should be telling in itself.This game is simply a crude, inferior version of Dark Souls in terms of level design, itemization, and game play. If you are starved to play a Souls like game I guess play this? But honestly best to skip this game.			"
Recommended,68.2,"																It's not Dark Souls.It looks like Dark Souls, it has all the mechanics of Dark Souls, hell it even should be Dark Souls, but it's not. Somehow?That's actually a positive, though. Code Vein's extremely fun, not just because of the stupid-ass God Eater style anime storyline, but because it actually has pretty good gameplay too. If you're on the fence, definitely give it a try, it's surprisingly been REALLY enjoyable so far.A more complete edit after beating more of the game:This game made me feel like I was going to die, in the best possible wayNot in a masochistic HRRGH SO HARD Dark Souls way, but in the borderline hearbreaking levels of bittersweet tenderness in it's cutscenesA more complete edit after having played through more of the game:It's excellent.It houses an emotional core that is far and away superior to a lot of other games in general, let alone just within the incestuous little misery-porn soulslike subgenre.If you're the kind of person who wants to feel like they're about to die because of the latest beat in a well-executed, emotionally rewarding story, buy it. It's sad, it's heartwarming, it's wonderful.If you're the kind of person who just wants to rush through everything and kill the next boss, maybe don't bother. It's not very difficult and you'll probably just be confused and annoyed for most of it.			"

Recommended,150.8,"																Well don't buy this game expecting something like dark souls or bloodborne, CODE VEIN is kind of it's own thing. Story wise it's a cliched, cheesy, otherwise well executed shounen anime kind of story; thus you can expect lines such as ""fighting to protect..."", ""i will do anything for my friends"", ""it's time to end all the suffering and/or sacrifice"". Yes it's THAT KIND of story. Sometimes it would reach a point of cheesiness that i would burst into laughter at completely inappropriate times. Story telling is done through cutscenes or exploring vestiges which are basically someone's fractured memory in the form of red crystals. Gameplay wise, it's fun as hell. It's a souls-like game but it's more fast paced than dark souls or bloodborne but not as fast paced as sekiro. Where CODE VEIN distinguishes itself is within the blood code system. The blood code system is like RPG classes which came with it's own sets of passive and active skills, ranging from 4-11 skills per code. Once mastered the skills can be used on all classes which you can stack and/or combined. You can master most skills by either grinding or crafting while some are locked to their respective classes. To use skills you need ichors which you mainly get from hitting, parrying, and backstabing enemies though there are some passive skills that give you ichors by doing certain actions such as dodging. You get codes by either talking to certain NPCs after you progressed through certain point of the story or by collecting certain vestiges. These codes will define your play style, you can be a gun mage that does massive damage from afar and only getting up close and personal to gain ichor or......be a buff stacking melee fighter that does like 3 times the damage of a gun mage while having 1/3 times more HP and twice the resistance/defence like everyone else.			"
Not Recommended,61.7,"																So I wasn't going to review this game until I had completed it. However, at the pace at which I am progressing through the game, I feel like I will take forever to complete it because of how much time I am spending in the first area of the game and I have no desire to progress the story yet as I'm having a blast just farming the first area and helping others over multiplayer. First of all, I have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of the souls games. I played Demon's Souls for an insane amount of time, but never really got into the games that followed. So I went into this game not expecting big things or to love it as much as I currently am. The character creation is probably the best create a character I've seen in a very long time. While you can't change that much of your body shape and size, the details that you can change are fantastic. There's a ton of depth to the creator and it took me around an hour to finally decide on what I wanted my character to look like because of how many choices there actually are. Combat feels very free and flows very nicely. I play mostly as a caster type using a gun and sword. The amount of mixing you can do with the weapons is a nice touch. A mix for every situation in the game. Characters are, for me, interesting enough to keep me wanting to find out more about them. I'm sure I've got more characters to meet yet, but I'm excited to see where the story takes them. Some nice development has already happened and being apart of it is a joy.Have had no performance problems as of yet. I run everything on max settings at 1080p on an i5 6600k 1070 with 16gb of ram. All of the time the game sits very comfortably at a constant 100+ fps. I was expecting it to dip below during boss fights, but that's not the case. Very nice optimization.If you're looking for a slightly challenging game with a good story, great character creation and just all around fun, then I highly recommend you give Code Vein a try.			"
Recommended,54.3,"																There's good and bad in this game,and it is focused around two publics that will see it very different ways.I will write this review in three parts to reflect each side of the story and what is the same for everyone.For everyone:The way they chose to tell the character's story is interesting. You have to find remnant's of all character's memories to piece the story togheter. This is also the way you unlock new skills so you get story and skill progression at the same time!The character maker is pretty flexible and will allow a vast array of customisation options.For beginners in the genre:The game is pretty neat. It does a great job teaching you how to play the game,and the companions will do a great job aiding you in battle as well as navigating the rather difficult maps.The skill system also allows to try out a lot of different stuff really fast and without a way to get stuck if you don't build your character properly.For veterans:The gameplay feels really repetitive and unpolished. Very few enemy types are present, enemy placement is basic the the difficulty is a cakewalk. You will find maps hard to navigate without a map because everything looks the exact same in withing each area.To sum it up:If you play for the story,this this game is pretty good. If you want to play a soulslike game but don't feel ready yet for the super difficult ones,this one will feel like a great entry point.If you play for the difficulty and don't care for the story,it's to your own judgement.If you just want the character maker,take it.

Recommended,31.2,"																Out of all souls like games, code vein is one of those types that belong with being apart of the souls games, but instead of having to be invaded by other players and dying to someone higher leveled than you when much lower than them or perhaps have barely any experience, that is all thrown away and we are now only able to have a cooperative aspect which i love to have when it comes to meeting new people or just playing with friends along with having a password set if you just want to have friends to play with you. Overall this is one hell of a great game, 3 unique endings and whole ton of weapons and armor to have along with some character customization but not a whole lot for the body which i think that there should be more of for our unique tastes, I'm also awaiting for any new dlc's that will be coming out in the years to come for this amazing game and to have a great time playing for the endings and to have a great time with it and i hope for those who do give this game a try to also enjoy this masterpiece as well.

Recommended,19.8,"																This is not  A n i m e  D a r k  S o u l s.And that's okay.From all of the marketing of Code Vein, I went in expecting a Dark Souls clone with Anime designs, and for the first hour or so I was honestly quite disappointed. Weapons felt light. Animations felt clunky. I considered refunding and moving on.Then I slept on it.When I awoke, I decided to play the game not as a Dark Souls clone, but for what Code Vein really is: A heavily customizable class based hack n' slash RPG with Dark Souls-esque Stamina Management and Checkpoints. And wow this game does it well. Blood Codes are what this game does in terms of a class system. You inherit these blood codes from different characters and memories, each with their own set of unique abilities matching the character, leaning towards a certain playstyle. If you like being a quick, dodgey dex character? There's a Blood Code. If you like being a support mage? Blood Code. Giant Dad? Blood Code. On top of the Blood Code system, you can ""master"" abilities inside each code by using them frequently, and once you've mastered the ability, it can be used in ANY Blood Code, meaning you can create your own personal Code for your playstyle. I've been playing using a 1 hand sword dex Blood Code called Prometheus, and taking abilities from several others to buff my weapon and stamina usage so I have high burst DPS.Exploration plays a huge part in making Code Vein what it is. There are so many branching paths in each map with secret items and upgrades, such as Vestiges, which provide you with new abilities and insight into the back story of different characters by viewing their memories, and excellent way to include optional story telling and lore.The character creator has already been covered EVERYWHERE, but to summarise: It's anime. It's great. Yes, you can make Megumin.Map design in all the areas I've been to so far (up to around the 6th boss) has been good, not quite excellent, but definitely passable and immersive.I'm running the game with the following;i7-8700k @ 4.9GhzGTX 1080 Ti32GB 3200MHz MemoryRunning on an NVMe SSDI've had no performance issues at all, consistently hitting my 144 FPS Cap, seems fairly well optimised.In conclusion to this rambly review, Code Vein is about half way between Sword Art Online Lost Song, and Dark Souls, in both terms of Play Style, and Quality. I would give it a solid 8/10, definitely worth picking up and playing, even at full price.One final note: ♥♥♥♥ the Cathedral. Seriously.			"
Recommended,29.7,"																So, I have very mixed feelings about this game.  Overall, I think it is a good game.  The higher than normal difficulty is refreshing, but it didn't feel over the top like some games of this genre.  The graphics are very nice looking and the story over all was engaging enough to see me finish the game solely for the sake of the story.  However, I have a few gripes and dislikes about the game that would cause me to not recommend this to a friend, especially not at the AAA game price tag.First off, the combat.  The combat feels fun and engaging at first.  But becomes a lesson in futility.  Special attacks like backstab and parry are completely unreliable to pull off and just hinder you in combat if you try to do them.  The animation locks also make combat extremely frustrating at times, especially if you are fighting more than one enemy at a time.  If you get hit once you are likely to get hit again because you can't do anything while your characters hit animation is going.  If fighting 3 or 4 enemies this can easily mean death if the enemies are attacking near the same time, while you sit there spamming your evade key helplessly watching your character get pummeled and not evade.As for the story, the memory system in this game is agonizing to me.  Forcing you to crawl slowly through voice only cut scenes has zero point to it.  I mean if it's just for the visual art style of them, have the character auto walk so I can just sit back and relax and soak in the story, don't force me to have to navigate at a snails pace with no interactions.  I found myself loathing having to deal with a memory but at the same time wanting to know the back story.In the end, I must've have missed some very important story details because of this loathing for the memories.  Because the ending made nearly zero sense to me.  Things happened and were referenced that I have no idea why or what they were.  Also, the ending was kind of abrupt.  I would have expected much more to have happened.			"

Recommended,105.6,"																I had been eagerly anticipating Code Vein for some time. My time with the Souls franchise had come to an end ever since exhausting each title in the series, racking up hundreds of hours on PS4 and PC alike. However, I was hoping that Code Vein would have sated the desire for more Souls-like gameplay. So a friend and I decided to buy Code Vein day one after hearing Bandai Namco was behind it. Another friend generously gifted this to me for my birthday. The price tag at launch was fairly steep. I usually reserve day one purchases for Souls-like gameplay as I expect to lose hundreds of hours to those. I simply cannot recommended this game if you are seeking an enjoyable online, multiplayer experience. Online multiplayer is not only laggy but severe rubber banding will push you into an enemy attack when you actually went to roll or dodge *out* of the way. I cannot reliably parry or even backstab when I am being rubber banded away from my target constantly. So it trained me to do attacks from a distance (i.e. using magic). That's not how I like to play Souls games. This isn't just my experience. My friend has the exact same experience when joining my world. It means we have to change the way we play if we desire to coop. In addition to this glaring problem, the game suffers from the following:- frequent FPS drops on my computer and my friend notices this as well. Nope, not my rig either. It's just an issue we notice in parts of the world.- if you beat a boss and don't save correctly, you may lose your progress and have to fight said boss again. Jesus. That's annoying. Dark Souls lets you save anywhere in the world from what I recall.- Numerous cut scenes and 'memories' where you must slow walk to multiple points. This is boring and the fact I cannot walk normally is not enjoyable. While you can skip memories, you might miss out on something integral. I was told later that by skipping memories, I might have missed a monument I had to interact with. Really? Whose idea was that.- The game feels balanced around AI coop. I don't care for that kind of balancing. From time to time you come across a boss that you do pitiful damage on despite changing strategy. Should you decide to give the AI a try, they will just mow down enemies like it is nothing. All you need to do is stand back and watch. Snooze. Side note on the AI: the female AI are just cringe-worthy. Can someone tell me why poor Io is just a doped up zombie ;)So, if you aren't concerned with the aforementioned points and you are playing this in single player, you will probably have fun. The character customization is well done. As many have stated before me, you can create the perfect husband or waifu. If that is what floats your boat. For me, however, this was not a draw. I was seeking a Souls-like where I could have a good challenge and engage in coop. Knowing what I know now, I probably would have ignored this at launch and bought it on deep discount. I will finish this title and see what happens to the main characters. But because the initial draw to play this was online coop, it failed on that front, for me. I hope your experience is better.

Recommended,30,"																If you like Soulslike games and Anime then this is definitely for you, if you don't like either then stay away. This is not a perfect game and will convince anyone to be a fan of these genres but it caters to those who already are.The options menu is very good and the port runs very well for me at 100+ FPS, you can rebind all keys including on your controller, i tested it with the PS4 and Xbox One controller and both work perfectly with this game.Character creation is very in depth and a big highlight. You can also edit your character later on if you want to change a few things, overall graphics are decent, i like the Art style a lot but textures are just okay, the animations are nice and fluid but nothing that will leave you in awe.In terms of gameplay it is very much a soulslike, but it is on the easier side and the combat is not as satisfying compared to Bloodborne or Dark Souls.As I said in the beginning this is not a perfect game but if you are like me and love Soulslikes and Anime well...then you probably already bought it, if not certainly give it a try!

Recommended,88.2,"																I'm torn with how to review this game. On one hand, it has good, solid mechanics and the day one patch has removed any and all performance issues (at least for me). On the other hand, this game expects you to read its mind.Imagine the following situation: You are sent out to buy milk. So you go to the store and buy that milk. It was the absolute last carton of milk in the entire world. You come back and are told that you SHOULD HAVE KNOWN to bring chocolate cookies. What else could the milk be for?So you go and buy chocolate cookies. But by the time you get back, that last carton of milk is gone, drunk in frustration about you making a mistake and now you can only have the cookies, but never the milk, even though you were never told to get the cookies. The result? You get the bad ending of the game. You get it because you weren't an oracle and couldn't read the mind of the developers.The devs expected you to know how to play their game without them ever telling you.If you simply want a souls-lite that you can play every now and again and don't care/skip the cutscenes, then get it. It's fun.If you care about the story in the slightest, then play with a guide. Else you get punished for mistakes you were never told you were making. I wish I could refund this mess of a story turned sour.			"
Recommended,67.3,"																If you are a Dark Souls and Anime fan, this game is a dream come true.It has a bit of a slow start because the lack of skills and good weapons at the beginning, but it gradually picks up momentum and it get better as the story and your build options progresses, now I just can't put it down, it's every bit as good as it sounds.It features:-Weighty Dark Souls combat.-Sexy and cute ladies.-Anime style.-A wide variety of skills to modify your build.-One of the best character creators out there.-Coop There are only two problems with the game:-No Breast slider (I guess the game was meant to have more advanced body type customization, but were pressured to remove it by the usual suspects)-No PvP.If you see a low scores in Metacritic, its written by anti-Anime journo-activists who probably didn't even play the game and just can appreciate the style or anything that is atractive.Support good games, support anime, support sexy waifus, do yourself a favor and buy this game.

The environment though, looks really dull, and some areas are just not designed very intuitively. I get it if they tried to follow the souls level design, but some areas completely fail to follow the formula in a smart wat. Mostly stable but there are some performance hiccups here and there. No out of the box support for ultrawide, you need to fix it on your own. I would recommend it to people who enjoyed the soulsborne games. Gameplay is awesome, the rest is just ok. 7/10Edit: Forgot to mention character creation. It rulez, you can get reeealy creative.			"

Recommended,3.4,"																штож.Это, пожалуй, самый никчёмный и безыдейный соулс-лайк который я видел.Сделанный людьми, которые за всю жизнь выпустили полторы игры, и те - кустарные клоны монхана.Бандаи в пресс-релизах говорили, что хотели сделать своего рода микс из аниме и Дарк соулс. На выходе получился микс из гoвна и гoвна (аниме - гoвно).Список плюсов и минусов проще всего начать с плюсов (потому что их аж один):- кастомизация персонажа. к сожалению, этот плюс не работает, если вы не фанат виабупараши или онеме.Средне:- система классов (Blood Code внутри игры). задумка норм, реализация - говно. каждый код - это своего рода класс, со своими скиллами и статами. скиллы бывают двух типов - уникальные для БК (таких скиллов ну штук 6 на все классы), и общие. общие скиллы при получении мастери вы можете использовать при активном другом классе. т.е. по факту, всю игру вы создаёте себе пулл скиллов, которые потом используете для билдов. но это не было бы поделие Бандаи, если бы тут не было какого-нибудь говна. БК вы получаете вплоть до финальных титров, а чем дальше в сюжетный лес, тем дольше нужно мастерить скиллы из кодов. т.е. фактически пройдя игру 1 раз, вы откроете 60% скилловв (условно) если будете задрачивать каждый код по мере открытия. любой вменяемый человек так делать не будет, посколько к мидгейму понятно с какими пушками тебе удобно играть, и смысла свитчиться между мели-кастер-рейнджер просто нет.- данжи. в отличии от Блетборна данжи не процедурные, что гуд. что не гуд - лейауты абсолютно всратые. типичный квадрат по центру, где ты спаунишься. и 3-5 ответвлений в сторону. одно из них обязательно запертая дверь к главной арене с боссом. данжей около 20, нужны для фарма ресурсов, не более того.Минусы:- ТЛДР, вся остальная игра.- хитбоксы - кал говна, что у игррока, что у оружия, что у противников- пэрри/бэкстебы - работают в 7 случаях из 10. боссы не бэкстебятся вообще. в самый ответственный момент бэкстеб не сработает с вероятностью в 95%.- левелдизайн... вспомните все те спидозные локации из соулсборна, которые вам ненавистны. теперь уберите из них открытость и сведите к банальным коридорам. теперь смешайте в кучу и обоссыте - получится левелдизайн в Код Вейн. мало того, что внешний вид просто спизжен (Анор Лондо, привет), так местный уебок-фанбой миядзаки решил добавить своего флёра, поэтому тут в 3/4 локаций есть падение с уступов на другие уступы, перекрытые проходы и бектрекинг.- боссы - унылый импотентный ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. если это не гирчекер, то просто пердула с 2мя трекающими/аое ваншотящими атаками. особого шарма добавляет тот факт, что трекающие атаки бьют на опережение доджа, поэтому лучший способ доджить - вперед (и надеяться, что ты не влупишься в модельку противника и сломаешь себе ебасос об атаку). тут тоже есть свой орнштейн и смог, только хуже в 10 раз. оба противника имеют рейнджевые атаки, которые пробивают даже колонны, которые есть на арене (в первом бою). арена в данже с этим боссом колонн не имеет, но во втором случае дизайнер уже просто охуел и спиздил даже поглощение одного босса вторым (в первом бою этого говна нет).- ИИ напарников... видимо, паттерн поведения брали у продюсера этой говнины, потому что такого тупого ии я не видел нигде. напарники будут 20 секунд доджить вокруг противника просто потому что у них мало хп (опция ""отбежать на спринте"", видимо, программисту ии в голову не пришла). у босса хп на 1 тычку - ии будет просто ходить вокруг него в блоке или опять же - доджроллить вокруг. все компаньоны были добавлены в игру как помощник/суппорт, потому как у них у всех по умолчанию есть скилл поделиться с тобой хп. но опять же, ии скорее натупит/останется в блоке или додже, чем кинет хп. иногда они кидают хп, но игра уже засчитывает тебе смерть по таймеру и ты не ресаешься.- отсутствие отмены анимаций/стаггерлок. внесу в один пункт, потому что это одного уровня проeб. виндап атак, анимация чардж атак, касты - у всего этого нет опции отмены, что в условиях нынешней боевки (у всех противников снепящиеся таргет атаки, если не все в мувсете, то минимум половина) вызывает разрыв аневризмы. местный poise - просто смехотворная хуита. игра пытается навязать тебе агрессивность и тем боя как в блетборне, но не дает тебе отхила ни за пэрри, ни за бэкстебы, ни за атаки. стаггерлок - самая популярная причина смерти на быстрых мобах или на паках. почему ты попадаешь в него? потому что ты решил использовать скилл с анимацией больше 0,003 секунды (именно столько выдерживает в постели главный геймдизайнер игры) - добро пожаловать в каскад ударов в eбаcoc, который ты не можешь сдоджить (ведь кенсела анимаций нет ггг)- сюжет - банальный виабу высер, со слезодавилкам для телочек. в игре есть тру, не тру, и плохая концовки, но нормальному человеку ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ на все. тру получить легче всего, потому что именно плохая концовка требует от тебя понимания как нужно изъебнуться для её анлока.- отсутствие спринта в сюжетных интерлюдиях и в хабе - в процессе игры нужно посмотреть около 40+ сюжетных сцен, которые сделаны не как катсцены, а как микрохуйня, где ты ходишь по кускам сцен и слушаешь спидозные ""сюжетные"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. спринтить или скипнуть этот кал нельзя. и ты как даун просто жмешь ""вперед"" и ждешь, когда же этот цирк закончится- оригинальность - отсутствует. 40% ассетов игры - из God Eater. сюжет прямым текстом указывает, что это спинофф годитера, но кто купит ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ никому ненужный спинофф ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ никому не нужного клона монхана??? поэтому, даем уникальное имя игре, шоб никто не заметил наёбку.глобальный ТЛДР: если перед вами стоит выбор: купить эту игру или заразиться эболой, то выбрав эболу вы получите больше удовольствия и приятнее проведёте время.вердикт: AVOID AT ALL COSTS			"

Recommended,56.9,"																This is the first souls-like game I have ever played so take this with a grain of salt. From this time I've only beaten the game 3 times on 2 characters and consider the game much easier than expected (discluding NG+ with enhanced difficulty). + Character customization is fun to mess around with if you're serious about making a character based off your imagination.+ The concept of the game was very interesting, however with the way the story was executed was not as appealing as I would have liked for it to be. + Being able to experiment with different weapon types and builds make this game enjoyable to different playstyle preferences, and not having to rely on  just one  meta weapon/build. Overbuffing for boss fights is satisfying. +/- The combat is fun but not exactly as fine tuned as I expected. +/- A fair number of builds have been nerfed, for better or worse.- Either I'm a souls noob, or some enemies have unpredictable attack prompts, or just very little time frames to react to. - In some scenarios you get staggered/hitstunned for a time long enough that you can't dodge out of range of other enemies, causing you to literally get pushed around and die to one mistake (unless that is normal).- Hitboxes seem disjointed: Enemies might hit you even if you are behind them. Some weapons seem too short ranged in perspective. Performing some Special Attacks still make you vulnerable to attacks since your hitbox is treated as if your character is standing still; when you use Severing Abyss you can still get cancelled mid animation when you're literally in the air and out of reach. If you made it this far, I'll say again that since this is my first souls-like game I may have some petty complaints that aren't even worth considering. Obviously not every game developer can make a game's mechanics 100% flawless, but I figured I bring up some annoyances that could be considered legit issues or just me being bad.The only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really complain about is the Tower of Trials.

Not Recommended,74.4,"																Code Vein is seriously an amazing action role-playing game that takes the best parts of the ""Soulsborne"" genre and weaves them into a fantastic experience. The combat is just top-notch, it demands skill and tactics, and every fight feels intense and impactful. I love the variety of weapons and Blood Codes available, it adds so much depth to the gameplay.But what really blew me away is the story. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, and you play as a Revenant, trying to uncover the secrets of the Vein. The narrative unfolds gradually, with cutscenes and interactions that keep you hooked until the end. I felt really invested in the characters and the fate of the world.And the character customization? It's a dream come true! You can make your Revenant look exactly the way you want, and the options are so extensive. Plus, the Blood Code system lets you switch up your playstyle, which is really cool. Visually, Code Vein is stunning. The art style blends anime-inspired visuals with a dark and eerie atmosphere. The environments are beautifully designed, from ruined landscapes to creepy dungeons and castles. And the attention to detail is just amazing. The sound design is on point too. The music sets the perfect mood for the game, and the voice acting is so well done, it brings the characters to life in a way that really connects with you emotionally.Now, I won't lie, the game can be pretty challenging, even if you're familiar with the genre. But trust me, it's worth it. Once you get the hang of it, mastering the mechanics feels incredibly rewarding. There are a few minor issues, like the occasional AI quirks, but they didn't detract from the overall experience for me.In a nutshell, Code Vein is a captivating and immersive adventure that manages to blend challenging gameplay, an engrossing story, and deep customization options seamlessly. Whether you're a fan of the ""Soulsborne"" games or just looking for a unique action RPG with a dark and atmospheric world, this game is a must-play!			"

Recommended,69,"																Code Vein is a weeb's wet dream for a souls-like, still getting through the game but it isn't bad. However, out of all the big souls-like games I've played this one is one of the more average titles. Even as a weeb. The story is average, I couldn't get invested into it; it requires a lot of exposition and the mystery isn't subtle. The combat is interesting with the use of passive and active abilities, however the combat with enemies grows to be very bland. Instead of fighting entirely new enemy types per new area, a lot of the enemies are basic reskins of each other with little variation in attacks. I found myself running through just wiping enemies due to the fact you can backstab enemies when they do their Metal Gear Solid Guard Exclamation Mark animation. The bosses are okay so far, some of them felt a little wonky like the Butterfly in the Park area with their charge attacks. Character customization is cool but it feels pretty lacking especially when considering the hype the game had for its customization. Weapons also feel a little bland so far in terms of variety. Level-design is a mix between neat and generic, some areas felt like dark soul levels such as the undercity area, felt more like a restrictive Farron Keep from DS3. Overall, this game is a solid experience but I would only ever recommending buying this game at sub 30 dollars. The coop is fun and I genuinely advise not using an AI companion. They're sort of overpowered and will walk you through the levels, so unless you're new to the souls-like genre and need that assistance to get into the games, I'd say turn it off. The game was definitely ""overhyped"" but that doesn't make it a bad game, just, the game itself is a lot more average and generic than it was made out to be. So if you like being a weeb dressed up as an apocalyptic dracula and just rolling through everything that comes your way, then I recommend this game.			"
Recommended,33.4,"																Pros: Excellent combat, fun and versatile character designer, lots of build variety, oozing with a personality distinct from other souls-likes, a few great bosses including a late game boss which is one of the toughest and most satisfying of any souls-like I've ever played.YMMV: EXTREMELY anime story, shounen dialog aplenty, the visual style of the game is distinctively anime and edgy, the story isn't fantastic but I found it at least engrossing enough to pull me from place to place. A lot of your enjoyment of this game is going to depend on your tolerance for anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, 85% of the game is pretty easy IF you bring a companion for the entire game (I'll bet most of the people saying this game is too easy haven't tried playing it with no AI companion).Cons: repetitive chalice dungeon-like bonus content, lack of enemy variety, and not a lot of particularly inspired level design. One of the levels in the game is mind-bendingly confusing and poorly laid out. There are also a few user experience issues I have with the game (you slow-walk through all the memories and it can get pretty exhausting if you have a bunch you have to go through, to name one) and I also experienced a 3 or 4 weird (but not game-breaking or frustrating) visual bugs. I have discovered that this game has silly dance emotes. All faults are forgiven; this is a perfect video game. BUY IT.Conclusion: If you think you will like this game, it is worth full price. If you aren't sure if it's for you, it will be worth it on sale. For me, it is 100% up my alley; I'm on my second playthrough and I'm probably gonna do more. I'm very excited to see what improvements they make with this series if they make a sequel, and I really hope they do.			"

Recommended,62.9,"																So, yeah, this is basically Dark Souls anime. Instead of environmental subtle storytelling and people in armor, you have anime exposition through lots of cutscenes and 3d slideshow ""memories"", the power of friendship, and huge anime tiddies. And you can actually get a good ending instead of just choosing between burning alive or eternal darkness.The good:The combat is pretty great. The blood code system means you can swap builds at any time without running into the old soulsborne scenario of ""I found a cool new weapon but I spec'd into the wrong stats so it hits like a wet noodle"". You want to swap your big hammer pound town style for a quick agile swordsman or a bayonet wielding spellcaster? You can! Also, upgrade materials are easy to come by after a threshold and new weapons you find are already upgraded for that point of the game, so changing weapons is not a problem. You have a lot of different abilities to use (passive abilities, active buffs, special attacks, spells, etc), the ""mana"" for them is gained by attacking and specially parries/backstabs, so it encourages agressive play and using all of them. The mastery system also encourages you to try different playstyles, but it's optional and can be bypassed with items if you want to stick to one.The neutral:The maps are long twisty separate levels (some of them VERY twisty, like the damn Cathedral), instead of an interconnected world. The mapping system is pretty nice, it allows you to see where you've been by marking your steps with dots, and how much you've completed, and the way it is revealed when you find the mistles gives you a secondary objective when exploring. But, the levels do feel like levels instead of a world.The not so good:The gift unlocking menu is a pain, it shows you several animated popups for EACH one you unlock. And you'll unlock a lot on that menu.Also the secondary mission system is not great, it makes you go back to levels you have no reason to go back to (at least if you complete them before doing the boss like I do) without any hint of it, but it locks some stuff you need for some extra content.Also, the extra levels on ""the depths"" are straight up reused content and feel like filler. But they're optional unless you want to know Davis' story, or want to fight some bosses again.Finally, the difficulty curve is not very stable. Some areas or bosses feel like pushovers, then some others smash your teeth in. And then you have the invasions, that can feel more like a stat check than a skill check. Specially the ones in the cathedral, those are not a difficulty spike, those are a whole difficulty thorn of judgement.Overall, the difficulty is on the point of ""you might die a few times to some bosses"", not on the soulsborne level of ""you're gonna bang your head against this wall we call boss"".It's a good game. Anime af tho.			"

Recommended,27.6,"																Follow Cob Curates for more reviews!Code Vein is, at its core, a super anime Dark Souls. It does have some interesting ideas it brings to the table, and quite a few areas it falls short. After playing through it, I felt like it was decent, but not great. Most of the good points are countered by bad, which I'll explain below.The ability to change your Code (class, sort of) and gear on the fly allows you to instantly respec your character. This encourages experimentation and doesn't lock you in to a single play style, nudging the player to trying new things. Unlike Dark Souls and more akin to something like Fable, your character has access to many different activatable abilities that you can swap out and experiment with. Unfortunately, the game was easy enough that I found the most success in sticking with the same build through the majority of the game. It wasn't uncommon for me to beat a boss on the first try, and I'm no pro. The combat is functional and the gameplay itself is fine.The world design, while clearly influenced by Souls games, isn't nearly as interesting nor cohesive as the giants it lives in the shadow of. There are a few different biomes of varying degrees of interest. There's the broken down city, a frost area, some caves, a fire area, a desert, etc. There is one particular level section that is extremely long and tedious. Every time you thought you were done there, you had to go back. The game also features some extra dungeons called 'depths', but these are mostly reused assets and recycled boss fights, and thus, completely forgettable. The game runs well and the graphics are good, assuming you embrace the ultra anime stylings. Many of the anime character tropes you'd expect make an appearance-- the ultra-buff ex-soldier guy, the grizzled older guy, the bookish leader, and a whole slew of ridiculously sexualized women with mega-anime proportions. Some of the enemy design is interesting, although a lot of the bosses do boil down to 'sexy lady except this time she has ____ animal features'.The story is fine. It has some unique ideas and a few interesting characters, and there are multiple endings available.The online component is easy to use and works great, making summoning a friend to play with you pretty painless.Should you play this? Maybe. This is a pretty soft recommendation. If you're looking for a souls-like game, you can do worse... but you can definitely do better. If the anime thing really appeals to you, maybe you'll find something extra to like here. If not, you should probably just play through Dark Souls again.			"

Recommended,32.1,"																I came in as a Dark Souls series veteran, having beaten the game once before writing a review.From a start to finish experience, it was a mixed - positive experience.The controls were different from Dark Souls, but they work fine. You have an easier access to your abilities than you did in Dark Souls as they're mapped by a button combination instead. Hitting enemies feel good, the abilities feel pretty decent.The character customisation is pretty decent, it feels alright, although I could do without the large amounts of clipping, especially the mask.The levels start well, but begin to drop off into senseless boring mazes the moment they switch from a Fallout looking setting to a Souls' bland looking Cathedral Levels. Expect to search the maze for hours for missing items, sadly. The enemy variety isn't astounding, but they add one or two every few stages. Not like Castlevania or Dark Souls. It doesn't help the Depth all follow a similar or same structure.The levels take a lot from Dark Souls. You'll recognise some places essentially being Anor Londo, or Farron Keep from Dark Souls, down to lighting up 3 torches to open up progressing.You cannot get every Blood Codes in one play through, you have to do multiple.The combat is pretty solid, and the weapons are nice. The highlight of the game, if you care, are the memories. But that requires investment, but they are pretty good.Bugs? Playing with your friends can be a hassle. You actually have to set your download region on your Steam to be the same as your friends to play with them.Another thing is, late game, the more items you have, the more trouble you have connecting with your friends because of your inventory size. You have to remove your Blood Code ability setups, and move your inventory of weapons and items you don't use into the stash, turning off auto-replenish. That way, you have an easier time connecting to the player.This may be fixed, but as the time of writing this review, this is still a bug.Overall, while a few gripes here and there, I don't feel overall it hampers the enjoyment of the game.			"
Recommended,74.6,"																This game is pretty difficult... especially when you start getting into NG+ and NG++ territory,  but this game doesn't want you to feel like it is a difficult game.  The option of an AI partner and even a third cooperative player easily reduces the difficulty of this game drastically and that is really the difficulty selection.  You kind of get to choose how you want to play.  I highly recommend playing this game for it's endings.  Once you get through the game once,  running it another two times for the alternate endings is a breeze.  You come to realize how short the game actually is once you know how the maps are laid out,  and where everything is... but that isn't a bad thing.  Your first playthrough will and should take you the longest.This game is anime souls with abilities in short.  You're limited to 5 different weapon classes,  but not all of them function similarly.  For example you'll find an axe and a hammer under the hammer weapon class and they function very differently.  This game is a little more restrictive with how you get to customize your character,  but not at the same time.  There's a ton of blood codes for you to gather, 34 in fact,  and a ton of gifts to master and form to your own playstyle.  It's a very interesting take on building your character,  but overall-  dark souls is a little better when it comes to variety and equipment builds.I like this game,  and I want to support it-  but it's not exactly worth $60+ i'd say.  NieR: Automata is cheaper and is overall a better experience and package.  I still recommend this game, but if you're willing to wait-  get it at a reduced price.			"

Recommended,56.4,"																I regret buying this game and not refunding it within the 2 hour limit.The game isn't awful, but it's not particularly good either.  Somewhere between ""meh"" and ""It's okay.""  The story is of the typical anime genre of some crazy end of the world event with one person (the player) being the savior and exception to all the rules.  The characters are cliche' and somewhat bland, following all the classic fan service tropes that dialog ad nausea to a mute player character who's only sounds are grunts, groans, and yelps in combat.  I know this type of story-telling appeals to some, but I find it completely annoying and an aggressive waste of time that artificially drags the story well past the point of excitement and into the realm of skipping through 70% of all dialog just to get to the end.The game has a small frame rate issue and will stutter at times, regardless of what your video settings are.  It's not game breaking, but annoying none the less.Character design is excellent, even though the choice of breast size on some of the waifus have triggered a handful of outrage hit pieces from 'woke' gaming journalists.  My only complaint here is that character mouths DO NOT MOVE outside of scripted cutscenes.  This can be overlooked in most cases as the camera is far back enough.  However, there are plenty of times where the game zooms in and it's downright hilarious to watch blinking eyed mannequins holding a conversation.  However funny, it's immersion breaking to say the least.Not a fan of the combat.  It feels sluggish and unresponsive at times.  Hit detection seems like it's broken and is frustrating when you think you've finally learned a particular weapon's reach, but come up short (pun intended).  Dodging can get you killed until you learn how to do it properly.  Large enemy and Boss attacks often have a slow wind-up with a super fast and sweeping attack animation, meaning you have to dodge right before getting hit so your not dodging way too soon or coming out of the i-frame too early.  Parry is the bane of my existence.  I still can't figure it out, as I've tried timing it just before getting hit, right as the enemy swings at me, and all instances between the two, to no avail.  It simply works or it doesn't, and for me it usually doesn't.  Long story short, I starting using Guard 90% of the time.Overall, the game feels somewhat of a lazy design with heaps of fan service and anime tropes dumped on top in an attempt to hide this fact.  Maybe I'm being too critical and this is typical of games in the genre, but outside of a few moments the story actually held my attention, it felt like a chore to play.  Even though I don't recommend buying Code Vein, I would definitely wait until it's on sale before purchasing.  Not worth the full asking price.			"
Recommended,69.3,"																Playing Code Vein (Deluxe Edition) is like pushing hot wax uphill bare handed, while having your ankles kicked! It's a tedious frustrating grind with a repetitive, laggy unresponsive combat system. There are unreasonable difficulty spikes with ridiculous boss fights, and no way to change the settings.As challenging as it can be, it's also a good game with a good story and lots of content			"
Recommended,63.1,"																I'm going to start this off by saying Code Vein is not a good game.However. It is by no means a bad game, or not worth your time if you're willing to put up with its problems. It needs a lot of polish, it needed a lot more time in development to clean up the combat a bit and make things smoother. But when it does work, it is really rather good, and for all of its flaws the story is fairly well written and enjoyable enough. If this game happens to be on sale for... I'd say $25 or so, and you want a souls like with an excellent character creator and a weeby, but decent story, this is probably worth your time. Or at least a try.			"
Recommended,28.1,"																This is not Dark Souls 4. If you came here for that, just leave. All I see is Dark Souls players hating on this cause of the art style and the game not being ""Very Dark Souls like"" That's because, this game isn't Dark Souls, its Code Vein. The art style is different from Bloodborne and Dark Souls, they take some inspiration of God Eater for the graphics in game and for cutscenes. Secondly the combat is reminiscent of Dark Souls yes, but its trying to be its own intuitive thing with Charged specials from  Blood Veils, to combining combo's with some regular attacks and then using some gifts. Thirdly, as I said, its not Dark Souls 4, so don't expect it. This game is a lovechild of Dark Souls, Zelda (fair amount of dungeon crawling/looting in very different ways than Dark Souls, you have a map, etc) , and God Eater. Its not as hard as Dark Souls, you have an AI following you, but that doesn't mean the game is super easy. Sure normal mobs get swamped by you and an AI player, but that does not mean the bosses will be taken down so easily. All in all, this game gives a lot to love in it, but it is its own game. Do not buy this if you don't wanna find some loot, kill some baddies, and learn the combo's/ switch movesets mid combo. Last selling point on this game, it is not Dark Souls 4, it is a Dark Souls clone, so yes, it is going to be a little different, for better and for worse.			"

They just look different and have slightly adjusted numbers but everything plays similarly. It's clear this was supposed to be the bulk of the appeal so everything else was underdeveloped to crowbar this system in. When it feels like your choices don't matter and the system is shallow it ends up being disappointing since there aren't other redeeming qualities in my opinion. Enemies are all kinda the same, they just sprint straight at you and attack and then you can kill by mashing a single button. Bosses are more annoying than fun challenges. AI companions are completely braindead and just go afk a lot. The cutscene to gameplay ratio is atrocious and the story is so boring that it's a real drag having to watch 5 minutes of cutscene for every 5-10 minutes of gameplay. Level designs are annoying in a lot of places. Exploration is a headache. Also I beat  the game and got to the end after the final boss, went back to homebase, but it never gave me the achievements for my ending or beating the final boss and then didn't save so I have to beat the annoying final boss again if I want the achievement. That's another thing, if the game crashes it randomly goes back and deletes previous saves so you lose 20-30 minutes of progress even if the game auto saved before then. Not sure why it does that, seems really weird.			"

The only redeeming quality is the character editor. Bandai Namco, producer of dozens of licensed anime games with varying quality, tried its hands at a new original IP: Code Vein, often described as “anime Dark Souls”. Now, that description is not fitting because of two reasons: First, it does try something new with the formula at times (restoring the memories of others to get new skill sets, giving you an NPC partner). Second, it doesn't do the Souls formular justice, neither reaching the same quality of exploration, combat & boss fights of the original games nor changing the formula enough to be something else/better. One notable exception: the character editor. Because that one is surprisingly deep regarding character appearances (there are no skills to choose, stats to improve or anything like that).If you search for it, you’ll find many videos in which people tried to rebuild their favorite anime characters in Code Vein - and succeeded. This alone should prove the potency of this tool; I have never seen an anime character editor that provides as many customization options. Just a shame that the game immediately forces a mask on your character for plot reasons – with no option to hide it. So even if you have spent a lot of time customizing your face, in every location outside your base, half of that face is going to be hidden. There is an option to disable armor, so why not one for disabling the mask as well?Once your character is created, you are dropped into the world of Code Vein. I will leave the discussion of story & lore to other reviews, personally I found it to be non-engaging. The gameplay itself is structured like every other Souls-like and offers about the same combat options. I settled on a Greatsword build for my playthrough early on & it carried me through the rest of the game. The combat itself is serviceable but does not feel/look impressive, many of the weapons felt similar. Furthermore, the parry timing is odd and the backstabs seem to trigger at random. The game also loves to keep you into animations for too long, in multiple cases I died immediately after being revived without being able to move even an inch. Finally, my player character & her Greatsword also loved to miss enemies standing right beside her, even when using the lock-on feature. Still, overall, the combat works and while it is not great, it is not my main problem with the game.Because that dubious honor belongs to the map design. It is horrible. One location in particular, ripping off Anor Londo, is incredibly painful to navigate. Different height levels, towers, ladders, ledges to drop down from, elevators, levers, locked doors – and everything looks exactly the same. There are no proper landmarks or visual differences to tell your location. There are multiple crossroads which might even lead into more crossroads, where only guesswork can tell you where you might end up. And all the game offers you is a 2D (!) map without indicators for height levels (!!) to traverse the whole thing. Pair all of these troubles with the need to fully explore maps in order to get one of the better endings, as some items are required for that, and you got yourself a game in which you dread every new location. As most of them boil down to ruins, caves or ruins in sand or ruins in ice as well, they are not visually interesting to explore as well.There are many other design decisions I could criticize, for example not being able to quickly assemble vestiges without watching cutscenes, some incredible dull boss fights, limited enemy variety and the recycled, unimaginative, and overall boring “endgame content” known as the “depths”. But to keep this review limited in length, there is one last aspect I want to focus on in particular: technical problems.The game crashed multiple times on me, for example when my coop-partner (warning: please don’t play this game in coop if you like your friends, go for better games instead) wanted to skip a cutscene before the boss fight. Or just because the game wanted to crash – in the middle of a fight. We also experienced multiple instances of infinite loading screens when trying to join each other. All of these problems didn’t happen often enough in my 30 hours of playtime to make the game entirely unplayable but they certainly did their part to diminish the experience that is Code Vein even more.To conclude, Code Vein is just another Souls-like game that does not manage to reach the heights of the formula, as the Souls game explored it, or change it up in a way that it offers something else/better. It is not a completely terrible game but an incredibly dull and at times infuriating experience. There is just no reason to play this when there are better Souls-likes (and of the course the original games) out there. You might have some fun with this if you are really starved for this kind of game or just extremely love the anime aesthetic – but even then, definitely wait until it’s on sale before buying it. And don't even think about the season pass - it offers embarassingly little content, even for half the price, and none of it adds any lore/story.			"

Recommended,58,"																Beautiful ♥♥♥*ed up drama story!I really like the story specially because it is based in God Eater universe. As for the gameplay like my friends say if Spider can play it everybody can play it.The game is pretty much a souls-like game with anime visual style which makes it fun and interesting for people who like anime. The game by far is the easiest compared to Dark Souls 3 so you will not have trouble playing it if you are not used to this type of games, Dying does not punish you like in Dark Souls 2 so you could enjoy running around you will lose currency when you die but that is it. There are somethings similar to classes and skill trees called Blood Codes when you switch them they change your character stats and give you different abilities and you have to choose armor and weapons based on them. To give an enemy a powerful attack you must attack them from the back and it initiates a nice animation but most of the time it does not kill the enemy whatsoever. The world size is small and you feel a little bit overwhelmed thinking you could discover a hidden area or a hidden location but the sad truth there is not much to look for.The game is very smooth runs on Ultra with no problems on GTX 1070 i5-7600k 16gb rams.The character creation is top tier with full accessory customization, face presets with very few body sliders and a couple outfits that goes under your armor. I personally made my character with horns and black eyes :K			"
Recommended,37.1,"																Code Vein is a fantastic game that I wish wouldn't be lumped in with Dark Souls when its so much more than that. Its ability to change classes (blood codes) and the amount of varied skills (gifts) is great for changing how you want to play the game, from being able to block and tank attacks, dodging around the enemy to find opening in their attacks, staying at a distance to shower the enemy in bullets and magic, or a full on support role to keep your partner and yourself alive. The story is straightforward yet I'm finding bits of extra lore through loading screens or descriptions that add on to the world building that make the story more and more interesting. The areas are somewhat samey with its industrial setting but it offsets that with how varied each area is, from a deep water sewer to being up at a snowy mountain covered in destroyed buildings overlooking the crumbling city below you. Each endings gas something to give you that you cannot unlock in the other endings that keeps its replay ability going. The NPC partners in the game have a lot of charm and love put into them and their stories are compelling enough to keep them likable throughout the whole journey with them. With your journey through the world you will encounter special items called Vestiges that work as powering your character up as well as giving you a backstory on whoever's vestige you pick up. When you restore a vestige you will do a short dreamlike walking segment where you see the vestige bearer's thoughts at that time which give you a lot of insight to what they are thinking or feeling. These vestiges will also unlock Blood Code gifts that are locked away until restore a vestige. There are even endings that are locked behind certain vestige unlocks The soundtrack is incredible, however most of the game is full of ambient sound that pumps up into this blood pumping battle theme when enough enemies aggro onto you. Boss themes are exciting and the somber songs while walking through the dreamlike memory sequences are heart tugging. Go Shiina is a great composer and I'm glad his work in this game is of the same high quality he always is able to produce. The combat is very straightforward yet there are little nuances that make them much different from dark souls. Each attack chains into each other fluidly and there are combo button presses (for example, R1+Square/Shift+LeftClick/RB+X to do a quick forward lunge attack or R1+Triangle/Shift+RightClick/RB+Y for a launch attack.) that chain into your normal light or heavy combo. However where the game shines in its combat is the ichor system. A bar at the bottom right of the screen shows up much ichor you have. Ichor is used for buffs, magic attacks, bayonet bullets, and some special heavy attacks. Your weapon has a drain rating to indicate how much ichor you drain from an enemy. You can gain ichor from attacking an enemy but if you hit an enemy with a Drain Attack you can increase the cap on your ichor. For example, holding the drain attack button will charge a special move depending on what Blood Veil you have equipped and if you are able to hit an enemy with that attack you will increase your ichor cap by 2 as well as getting back a big amount of ichor to your stock. There are even combo commands for a special drain attack (R1+X/Ctrl+Shift+LeftClick/RB+Y) to increase your ichor cap by 1 from an enemy. A fast weapon may have a middling amount of drain rating but being able to hit the enemy multiple times in one go can be much more powerful than a slow weapon that has a lot of drain rating, but only may be able to hit the enemy once before they retaliate. Adding onto this is the focus system where if you dodge an attack or take damage from it will fill up a gauge near your health and stamina bars. When the bar is full you enter a focus state where you deal more damage for a limited amount of time. In this state you even get a special drain attack when you do your launcher that increases your ichor cap by 2 while also doing heavy damage. The leveling system is easy and you don't have to worry about allocating stats. Instead stat proficiency is based on what Blood Code you equip (which I will talk about later on) and all leveling does is increase your overall power like health and weapon damage. You level up by getting Haze from enemies, which act as souls (EXP and Money) and you can use that Haze to unlock Blood Code skills or purchase weapons and blood veils. The classes (blood codes) all do different things ranging from focused on pure melee combat but having low a ichor cost or a magic build that does not excel in melee combat but does more damage with gifts and have a higher ichor stock and almost everything in between. Each Blood Code has its own special skills (gifts) you can equip to your character that either passives that increase your character's stats or actives that act as magic attacks. You unlock gifts through using Haze. However you can only use the gifts in that Blood Code unless you master the gift through using the gift until you fill out the gift EXP bar or unlocking the gift by using special items to instantly master them with Haze. You can equip 4 passive gifts at a time and each one can significantly change how your character feels, such as having a bigger health pool, a larger stamina bar, increasing certain stats to be able to equip a weapon, blood veil or gift, increasing your damage based on what weapon you prefer or how fast your character is. You can equip 8 active gifts that act as buffs, healing, or combat spells. The weapons have the right amount of weight behind them and their designs are so unique. Each weapon has its own different kind of scaling, stats, base damage, weight, block defense, and drain rating. Armors (blood veils) look amazing, even if some of them are just recolors of a certain veil, however Armor recolors are not a bad thing, being able to change how your armor color is to match your character motif is great. There are 20 different kinds of blood veils with each kind having 3 different color variations. There are 4 different kinds of blood veils types and each are similar enough to each other to be able to use them all but each of them have different timings to their parries and their special drain attacks that are all different from each other. Each blood veil also has a weight limit to them to show how fast your roll will be. A quick roll will have you dashing very quickly with a very small amount of recovery frames, a medium roll will have you do a quick roll forward with moderate recovery frames, and a slow roll will have you do a short, quick roll with a lot of recovery frames. I have not had any problems with multiplayer so far. I've been able to connect with both random people and my friends easily with a password. Its what you expect from co-op, its very fun and engaging to work with someone to clear out an area and defeat the boss. There is also incentive for co-op with others through medals, where you can unlock special icons and titles to have over your partner name to show how much you've helped others. Overall its an excellent game made with love and care and I look forward with what Yuta Yamamoto, SHIFT, and the God Eater team can cook up through a sequel and the DLC in the season pass.			"

Recommended,56.4,"																You've probably heard people call this game ""Dark Souls, but anime.""I don't think that's necessarily true. While the inspiration and influence are clearly there, they don't necessarily feel similar outside of the general combat/xp structure. The combat mechanics from Souls games are all there, but another big component is missing - proper level design and world building. For me those are some of the best qualities of the Souls franchise and they are lacking here. So to call it ""Dark Souls, but anime"" is a misrepresentation of both games. I won't spend my whole review comparing the two so I'll stop the comparison there.On to Code Vein:It's a good game - I wouldn't say a great one though because it does have a couple issues. Cons:Difficulty - I desired more from it. No boss ever took me more than 5 tries to beat and the areas leading up to the boss were just fodder. I used a Zweihander for reference as I always like playing with slow heavy hitting weapons. I got bored in certain areas because I felt incredibly overleveled despite the fact that I did no grinding Level Design - Some levels are really nice, but most are just rubble, rebar and trash. It also doesn't even feel like you're in a particular place, it just feels like there's roads that go everywhere and they don't create a realistic or immersive world.Characters - Most women are just mindless boob bags with not much else to offer and most dudes are just your standard hero tropes. Not much hereStory - never pulled me in and felt poorly written. Won't say anything else to avoid spoilersPros:Versatility - although I played the majority of the game with the Zweihander and Atlas class, I love the fact that you can swap all abilities and class types on the fly. You don't spend all your points in one class and get stuck like in other RPGs.Combat - the general combat cycle is fun (when the challenge is present). Weapons and abilities have cool effects and the moves are precise and tightOverall I'd give the game a 6.5/10If the level design was better, it could easily be much higher. That was part I felt was the weakest.			"

The customization range is rather charming, especially if the modding community can get really creative. It's beautiful to look at, and the combat takes time to get used to, and even longer to master. It's frustrating during the learning process, but then again, lots of games have that issue. The characters have some level of depth, and the companion system is probably what makes this game easier than other Souls-like games, so if you like a challenge, you have the option. Other than that, it's not bad for an attempt at a 3D anime game. It's better executed than most others, at least.			"

Recommended,167.8,"																After going thoroughly through the game I am confident I can leave a solid review of it. It is an anime souls-like that takes inspiration from other games of the genre, alongside a classical anime story with the expected stereotypes. It really tries to emulate the dark souls games with its own spin to it so some situations can seem stacked against the player until you can figure out what to do and correct any mistakes made.In its normal story mode I found the game very enjoyable, as most boss fights were more forgiving than the ones in the dark souls games and as a consequence, there are many character builds that you can cruise through without feeling you are getting the bad end of the stick.The character customisation system is near perfect and you can control many aspects of how your character looks like, though that extends to clothing and accessories, not necessarily the armors you will be using. Finally, when it comes to the anime feel, it delivers the same way that games like God Eater does (there are many similarities with the two series) and if you enjoy that, it is certain that you will enjoy a playthrough of this game, as it can give you all that anime goodness without being impossible to play through.Performance wise, the game seems very solid. I only experienced 3-4 fps drops in my whole hours of playtime so far, and it was on some extreme close camera chaotic moments.The few things I did not like about the game were the parrying mechanics and its New Game+ mode. Most parries (that are keyed to what armor you wear) are delayed and as such, parrying didn't feel as valuable as learning to dodge or block properly. While there were many defensive in-game abilities to substitute for when one would like to parry, I wish they were a little faster to encourage getting good with them.Finally, once you beat the game and have the option to start a NG+ playthrough, the enemies are WAY more powerful than what you'd expect on a NG+ of dark souls/bloodborne and as such the one-shot factor rises by a million. The AI partner that the game gives you and can easily make your normal playthrough enjoyable and easier just does not have enough numbers to compete and doing certain bosses with this enhanced difficulty and without a friend to cooperate with you can be an absolute nightmare.Despite this endgame complaint, I have to say I really loved the game and even the story for all its stereotypes had some unexpected twists so I would easily recommend it to anyone who thinks they'd enjoy what it offers.			"
Recommended,65.5,"																A very fun souls-like, which differentiates itself by having a story you don't have to search wikis for, and companions who join you in battle.Despite some ""professional"" reviewers panning the game for the inclusion of digitized jiggle physics and viewable skin (which seems ludicrously puritan in our current day and age), this is well worth playing for any fan of the genre.If you enjoy having an excellent character creator system, or are a fan of anime,  you'll likely enjoy it all the more.

Recommended,53.2,"																This game is a souls-like, action JRPG, and a bad one at that.Pros - The character creation is mostly great. There are a ton of options for crafting a character that is unique to you. You are able to change things like hair, makeup, and clothes at anytime during your playthrough, but actual facial structure and body options are locked after you lock in your character. My only complaint is that there are few clothes options, and the ones we get aren't very good in my opinion.Class customization is interesting. The game allows you to switch between several dozen different classes whenever you want, provided you have unlocked them and leveled them up enough to take on your current challenge. There are gun users, giant hammer users, magic users, and everything in between.The game has a pretty good soundtrack. I haven't listened to it on its own enough to pick out anything specific but I liked it well enough.Cons -The combat is very boring. There is very little enemy variety, and the enemies do not have interesting move sets that feel fun to play against. This game definitely has the 'throw more enemies at them to make it challenging' mentality. It is like they watched a 5 minute trailer for a dark souls game then tried to copy it.Level design is underwhelming. Each new location feels only slightly different than the last. A post-apocalyptic  location rarely ends up being a good choice for an overal setting because everything is just saturated with gray tones and char marks. The cathedral is one area that stuck out to me. It is basically a massive, multi-level maze that requires you to explore most of the area to get to the boss. there are secret drops and chests and mini-bosses everywhere. It would've been very fun to explore if the entire location didn't look the same.Weapons don't feel unique enough.I have not played through any of the DLC and do not intend to, but from what I've seen they seem like rip-offs.			"
Recommended,45.5,"																Calling it anime Dark Souls is about half right. It has a very similar base, and a lot of superficial elements are used. However, the core is blood magic. Everyone gets blood magic, even if you are playing as a tank, there is no reason not to use it for buffs, dodges, attacks, or traps. The build philosophy is also closer to Nioh as opposed to Dark Souls where you are encouraged to try out and play all the different styles, and is made even easier than in Nioh, as you can switch builds mid area. I think that is a bit weak, and is part of why stuff like a certain ability is absolutely broken. Make a build around that ability and then switch to it for the boss, and bypass the downside that way. Build variety, however, is quite good, and while early magic is quite unimpressive, late game magic can be both visually impressive and powerful. The real nice thing is the way your spell stock (ichor) works. You get it back by attacking enemies; you can more efficiently get it back using drain attacks, which will also increase the maximum up to a point based on your class (blood code). The benefits are pretty obvious and means that you are less concerned about saving up for the right moment to use it since you can earn it back by fighting. Each weapon and armor (blood veil) has a different drain rating which affects how well you can earn ichor back. Blood veils are also a reason that all builds can and will want to use magic; they are simultaneously your armor, your casting medium and another weapon in the form of drain attacks. Drain attacks are, unfortunately, very lengthy for a full one, but there are also combo drains.There are some issues with some weapons feeling particularly weak until you get the ability from the right blood code. This means that a lot of people will default to two handed swords because they give good feedback, and have good damage. It will also take a bit before the blood code system really gets going; you need to grind out masteries or mastery items before you can start customizing your build. Once you start getting a lot of abilities, the system starts coming together.If I had to say there is one thing I outright disliked, it is the way character backstories are presented. I like the character backstories, but the way they are presented is walking sim tier. Even just a bunch of cutscenes would be preferable to what they did. They even do that a couple of times. It is very frustrating.			"
Recommended,221.3,"																People call this ""darksouls but anime"" but I would rather say it's ""Bloodborn but anime"" as the mechanics and theme is more similar.The difficulty is what you would expect from a game like this, with grinding being a decent way to make things easier, but you WILL need to learn the game in order to get past the halfwaypoint.That being said, the anime atethic does get a bit too much at times. With characters having very... overexaggerate features. (women especially) But if you can get past that and focus on the combat, its a good game. The story itself is nothing prize winning, but its passable.			"

Recommended,85.7,"																An Amazing game in of its own right, and a great contender as a souls-like.8.5/10 will update further as play continues.Gameplay and combat is fantastic. Character creator is one of the best I've seen in a long while.Pre-ordered and purchased 80$ Deluxe and feel like the game is worth every penny I spent.Edit: After putting a substantial amount of time into the game and beating it multiple times on multiple difficulties, I would easily rate it on a personal 10/10. This is by far my favorite game to come out since I played Ds3 on release. However that withstanding, everything I said previously still remains true, and I'd even keep the 8.5 rating overall. The game won't be for everyone. It takes getting used to to feel the flow of combat and how the builds and skills start to compliment one another. However once you reach that stage this game feels amazing and fluid to play. I've played through multiple times on multiple difficulties with multiple build types and every time I did every build I tried to create felt very ""viable"". Meaning it may have seemed at disadvantages at times in comparison to the current area layout or compared to other builds in general but even still every build I used from caster to tank to support healer to fast paced assassin all work if you have the knowledge set. Of course this becomes subjective as a caster is harder to use and power up properly if you play the game with no prior knowledge compared to any build that uses a weapon for their main source of damage. Just as an example.Overall I loved my experience in Code Vein and have found myself slowly 100%ing depths, side quests, and creating multiple builds as I wait for others to join or for new dlc to arrive. An 80$ well spent for me and an 80$ still being well spent as I traverse Vein enjoying my build and the combat of Code Vein all the while the napping angel that is Io lends a positive supportive hand.Edit: Recommend the base game, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT recommend the DLC's. Separate review. No longer worth the 80$ to me based on the DLC alone. Get the game without the dlc's at whatever price you feel comfortable with, but even on sale don't get the DLC's.			"

Recommended,65,"																Okay. Serious Review. Don't listen to any of these other scumbags who say that this game's story is boring or bland. It's just not true in any way. I found the story to pull me in, i loved how every single character had a story, a history and we could see glimpses of that. And I love how the game gives your character a feeling of importance without being like skyrim, where you felt the world revolved around you. There are so many moments in the game where you can learn the backstories of characters and even stories of people that are just vaguely mentioned by someone who might have lost them. To be honest with you, this game made me cry a bit more than I would like to admit. The cutscenes are great, the story is great, the world building is great. THE GAME HAS 3 DIFFERENT ENDINGS. And all 3 of them can get you in the feels pretty good if you let the story pull you in like I did. The music is way more than decent as well. From the very start of the game, it has a main menu theme that kicks the crap out of any other main menu theme, and proceeds to beat them to a bloody pulp and curbstomp their head in. The music really adds to the emotion of the game. Don't get me started on that final track, or the memories of the lost theme. Really helps to convey the emotion set by the game. A certain moment in the game where you hear singing and are walking up a desert path, towards a ruined arena just feels so cinematic and really epic. There's music for every emotion in the game and they are accompany'ing cutscenes that hold these emotions well. It's Go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Shiina. One of the minds behind Nier music. It's that good.The combat is anime Dark Souls with a companion. You also have a bit more in terms of RPG elements, being able to have a ton of abilities and at-will attacks and powers that help solidify your character. You can make crazy min-maxing builds with buffs and attacks and demolish bosses and enemies if played right. You don't need to bring the companion, but personally I enjoy them at my side. They make the experience a bit more immersive and better for me.The character creation.... WOW. One of the best I've ever seen. You can get alot of time in the game just creating your character. I've spent hours upon hours of my time in game just messing with the creator that has alot of options! And I've heard they've added to it, letting you change your height as well as other proportions of your character too.I won't say much more, but if you like games with a Souls-Like feel, this game is for you. It's not a perfect game, it has it's faults. Particularly it can feel kind of easy at times. But also it can feel a bit clunky, the game is similar to Dark Souls 2 in the sense that you feel a bit restricted in movement. I could probably nitpick and find some other reasons to complain, but It's not worth the time. The game is fun, has a great story, and I can't wait for the next one.Also it has COOP and is a very fun coop game to play. So right there is a game changer.

Recommended,93.2,"																Code Vein aka WeebSoulzThis is a soul-like game set in a  post-apocalyptic world. You incarnate a Revenant, an undying being, with more power than the other Revenants : you can absorb memories from the others. This will grant you acces to TONS of skills and special ability. Unlike a classic soul game (let's take DS1) you are not forced into a playstyle, you can just change it in the middle of your playthrough at almost no cost. The story is pleasant but not amazing, the gameplay is more nervous than your classic soul game, if you're in for some challenge I advise you to not get help from a partner, if you want to have a stroll in a park just play with a partner :) .  There's not a huge diversity of ennemies in the game which is a pity, they are all the same once you've completed the first 3 areas.I'd rate it 8/10, if you like souls games and anime go for it  			"

Recommended,55.3,"																If you mix anime and Dark Souls - what you get is Code Vein and it does it fantastically well. The game is every weab's dream featuring questionable attire customisation, even more questionably dressed characters and the good old Japanese voices with the classic anime lines.The game has all the standard Souls-like features such as refreshing your heals also refreshes the map's enemies, if you die you have to retrieve your exp without dying or you lose everything and combat against all enemies where a single mistake can destroy you. Combat is a mix between the classic 'swing-your-weapon+dodge' (where every weapon has their own unique animation) and something the game calls 'Gifts' which are special abilities that are based off your class.Classes in the game is done in a particular unique fashion, where you can play a certain class and earn exp on  the abilities so you can use those abilities in other classes - which all have their own abilities. Each class has their own stat differences which also allow you to customise your characters to how you want to play.The most highest selling point for me in the game was the fact that it had co-op which was done in a semi annoying but functional fashion. One of your friends can join you in the battle, both gaining exp but once you beat a zone - the host will no longer to able to call for help anymore and your co-op partner gets a reward and gets booted. Its annoying but it works.The story is portrayed through dialogue between companions, in-game cinematics and an interesting feature involving memories which was good (and bad at some points). The plot and world slowly reveals itself throughout the game but it has all the classic anime mumbo-jumbo you would every expect.Overall its a great, fun game with a friend and I highly recommend it.8/10			"
Recommended,34.5,"																Vampires that can't replenish health from certain attacks is the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ ever.TLDR: Code Vein is, to some extent, a good and fun game, but as a Souls-like it sucks. The only redeeming factor (for me) is that it's Big Tiddy Anime Vampire Souls-like.============The good============Character creation: it's definitely better than the Souls games but Nioh 2's character creation and transmog mechanic makes customization better. Still, really good looking customization options for anime characters.Build customization: There's a lot of ""classes"" and skills to obtain. You can even borrow skills from other classes, so there is a whide range of play styles possible. This reason, plus character customization, is the reason why I have maybe a dozen characters now.Interesting story: as of this writing I haven't finished it yet, but it has the familiar nuances that comes with anime stories. There was a part of the story that made me cry but I'd rather not post it here. Yes, the game's been out for years but just gonna leave it out for those who haven't been spoiled by the internet.=============The bad=============Dodging is way harder to do than in the Soulsborne games. Heck, I could dodge way better in Nioh 2 and that game is way more fast-paced than this. On the flip-side, the quick dodge animation is awesome, though.The combat is clunky, even one-hand sword attacks feel slow. If you initiate a fight with an attack you will most likely get hit back, so you always have to wait for the enemy to make the first move if you don't want to take damage.The parry mechanic's timing is horrendous. I'm bad at parrying but at least in the Souls games I can see the parries connecting or not and it makes sense visually, and the parry window activates almost as soon as you press the parry button. In Code Vein there's still a second or so before it can actually parry.The backstab mechanic is inconsistent. The chances of you getting a proper backstab is less than 50%. In the Soulsborne games, if you were behind an opponent that can be backstabbed it's almost guaranteed that you will get a successful backstab.Staggering bosses does nothing. Yeah, it gives you a small window to go ham but by the time you get that window you probably already exhausted your stamina and/or ichor, or your attack skills are on cool-down. At least in Elden Ring you can riposte most staggered bosses.The ichor mechanic is ♥♥♥♥, to some extent. If you want to increase your ichor pool you need to connect drain attacks and that's easier said than done. The easiest way would be to connect backstabs but I already mentioned how the backstab mechanic is ♥♥♥♥. The next easiest way is to connect during a combo, but there's a lot of problems here. If the enemy dies you can't connect with the drain attack. If the enemy doesn't get flinched by your attacks, you will get hit and your drain attack will possibly get cancelled. The next way to obtain it is via charged drain attacks, but charging takes forever and if you get hit you get staggered out of the drain attack. And then there's parrying but parrying is ♥♥♥♥ in this game.The targeting mechanic is ♥♥♥♥.My final thoughts================I still think my purchase is worth it and I have no regrets getting the game, but I'll still give it a downvote. I still think it's fun to some extent and will probably put in a couple hundred hours into it, but it just sucks as a Souls-like.If you love big tiddy anime vampire waifus and hunky anime vampire husbandos then get the game, but I would suggest to get it on a sale. The original price is not worth it.If you want a game you think you'll have fun with, that depends on your patience on clunky gameplay mechanics. And still get it on sale.If you want a good Souls-like, don't get it. It's not worth it.			"

Recommended,87.6,"																Me: Japan, can we have Dark Souls?Japan: We have Dark Souls at home.Dark Souls at home…Joking aside, from what I have heard through the grapevine Code Vein cannot be Dark Souls, due to Dark Souls being harder.  I kid… mostly, as someone who has never played a Souls Like game before I enjoyed my time with the game, its characters and story.Does that mean that Code Vein is simply a rung in the ladder to reach Dark Souls difficult?  At a service level yes, one can view Code Vein that way.  I would say, however that Code Vein does put a lot more emphasis on story and characters than what Dark Souls appears to.  While the bosses in Dark Souls do indeed have lore and interest in them the same consideration cannot necessarily be said about the NPC’s or even the player character.“That is not the point of a Souls like game.”The above might be mentioned with regards to criticism of me specifically saying the player characters importance.  While a silent, faceless protagonist can work as a simple mechanism to experience the world, having a semi-interesting character and still having a deep world also still works.If you are looking for a game to tied yourself over between souls like games then Code Vein will indeed work, but even if you are not a souls like fan Code Vein does indeed work and is enjoyable without its obvious comparison.Pros:•	Variety of classes, weapons and abilities make for a variety of gameplay styles.•	DETAILED character creator.•	Very animeCons:•	Gameplay is derivative of other games, which do the individual mechanics better.•	Very anime.

Not Recommended,14.5,"																Souls-like, but it's different enough to stand out in the sea of clones, so it's easy to recommend (assuming you like souls-likes). It's still a clone, though....Visuals (7/10)Anime style is good. The graphics look and feel great (with few blurry textures, and oddly enough blurry object edges).My biggest complain here is player character has a blank facial expression, that only fits with T-pose of unanimated model. Seeing how much character customization there is (i.e. emotional investment into making one) it feels weird to have doll expression.Combat (8/10)I thought I played one souls-like, so I've played them all. I mean it's kinda true, but anime visuals, flashy ""magical"" counterattacks and more schools of magic makes it feel fresh.The one thing I would probably do differently is counters, which are determined by ""armor"" and depending on which one you use, the animation and counter frames are completely different. One is close to instant, while the other one is like 1-1.5 sec delayed. This means switching armors might be hell if you rely on counters.Progression (8/10)This game does 1 thing differently and it flips soul-like progression on its head.Stat distribution is based on equipped ""class"" and actual stats are based on level (which is just automatic HP/Stamina). While seemingly a small change, it means you can try different weapons and change your playstyle after every mission, if you like. This was my big complaint about few of these games I've played as trying and playing different weapons is discouraged and in some cases even impossible( in games where stats get locked in).Class system is an odd one. It is interesting to see and learn. You get access to skills through the classes and you can make most of them available to any class that has enough of specific stat. I feel like the only thing it actually adds to the game is the stat-distribution as an equipable. Most skills are useless and if you do find a useful one, it's annoying having to switch out to a different class to kill 10-20 to unlock it on the class you want to play.World/Story: good as a parody(5/10)It's generic anime story, set in a generic anime fantasy setting and pretty much anything to do with story/lore/world is generic for anime.See if this rings any bells: You appear without any memory (this game has a story reason, but it's really weak). You're special because you don't have a ""type"" and everyone else does. Hallelujah, 2 minutes later you find out your blood can fix one of the most pressing issues in that realm. You're being followed by another girl, who also has no clue who, what or why she is. Everyone you team up with is a do-gooder who can't do any evil. On that team of do-gooders you have a stereotypical anime team.....I initially thought the game made a joke about it by saying something like ""Wow, it's really uncommon for people too loose so much memory"", but nope, it was serious because as it turns out there's a story reason (a weak one).Achievements: Boring time wasterThese are not crazy ""complete everything"" kind of achievements, but they still doesn't respect your time. Beat every boss, get every skill, find everything while exploring (so far so good) Multiple playthroughs are required. I hate when games force you to replay the entire game while barely rewarding you for it. It's a fairly nice game to try, but I wouldn't play it twice, noto mention 3 times (needed for achievements). If you're not going for Remnant From Ashes design, you should probably keep your ""content"" accessible in first playthrough and leave replays for people who replay it because they enjoy the game. Multiplayer is forced....... Why? What value does multiplayer add to me?You can technically grind it in game, but that adds an insane amount of grind, compared to what multiplayer requires.Again, why would you force multiplayer in a single player game. It's a nice feature to have, but It's not one you should be shoving down people's throats, unless your creativity is so dried up you give an achievement for sitting through the first loading screen.			"
Not Recommended,36.3,"																Anime Dark Souls, featuring  Vampires in a post-apocalyptic world.If you find this very short desciption somewhat appealing, you might want to check this game out. The combat system is clearly inspired by the ""SoulsBorne"" games, whereas the story is presented more in a typical JRPG fashion (including cutscenes and conversations with party members in your homebase). It also feels less ""lonely"" than most Soulsborne games, as you can choose to take one of the story AI companions with you at basically all times.And while it does lack some of the polish found in From Software games (for example a certain enemy type seems to have a extremely inconsistent trigger for backstab animations and tends to stun-lock the player if hit in a certain attack sequence), I really enjoyed the broader selection of active and passive abilities to customize your own character, and the possibility to change your abilites and blood code (basically your ""class"") at any point, making it basically impossible to level up ""wrong"" or push the wrong skills (which is very much a possibility for newer players in many SoulsBorne games). However, it is possible to slow the learning of new skills to a crawl by ""overleveling"" for the current area, so try to watchout for that.One additional note: While it is possible to play this game in co-op, only the host player gets story progression, so it is best to see this as a neat little addition, not the main salespoint of the game.			"
Recommended,39.9,"																The character customization alone makes this game worth the price of admission. But, if you don't like souls-likes and the honestly pretty generic story and characters don't entice you, this game is a hard sell. The game is honestly very pretty and the costumes are sick, though. Plus, if you don't like souls-like games because of the difficulty, this one's relatively easy when you have an ai companion with you. But real gamers play without a companion after the first playthrough. Anyway, i recommend this game while its on sale for anything above, say, %25.			"
Recommended,94.8,"																Code Vein is one of my most favourite game. Some people likes (or hate) to compared this game with Dark Soul or something. But Code Vein is not like that, It more like hack n slash combine with souls-like game play. Combat is good and smooth, you can choose many types of build also custom your character appear. It takes you 40-50 hours to complete main game, and you can play NG+ to earn another ending or try another build. Story is good and if you like anime, you will like graphics and characters design a lot. Bosses and enemies are not bad but not good too, i will give average score. Map design is good at beginning, Cathedral of the Sacred Blood maybe the best map i have played, but some map in later game don't make me satisfied. So i will give average score for map design too.Overall Code Vein can not a masterpiece game like Dark Soul so don't waste time to compared 2 games. It maybe average game, likes 7.5/10 but Code Vein had a special place in my heart, I have a lots of fun while played this game. I enjoyed explore a map, fighting enemies with partner (you can choose the partner you like) and work together to defeat boss. It pretty fun because i don't have friends to play co-op with me. So i recommend this game for anyone likes me, a loner weeb who love souls-like and anime game. It worth to buy on sale or not.			"

Recommended,51,"																This game is fun. For a bit. And then it keeps going. And going. And then they expect you to play it through two more times. I don't recommend doing that. The story is asinine, the dialog atrocious (""Mountains are convoluted, aren't they?""), the combat is pretty loose, and there is too much recycled content. I describe the combat as ""loose"" because of the lack of precision. Parrying is... absurd, and mostly useless in my experience. Backstabbing enemies results in a great animation, but it's dependent on your armor set and there are only a couple different varieties, so you'll be tired of it after a couple hours. The class and skill swapping is a great idea, but there doesn't appear to be a way to save your own presets so you will have to manually change all 12 skills every time you want to alter your playstyle. There is an incredibly long level that showcases some of the most intricate design in the game... which is about twice as long as any of the other levels of the game... and then they repeat it again but change the color and layout... They also cut an entire phase out of one of the late game bosses and stuffed it into an optional encounter with the boss in the optional equivalent of the chalice dungeons, which are entirely bankrupt in content and ideas except for this one isolated instance. The DLC is absolutely horrific and should be avoided at all costs as it adds nothing to the story, adds no new enemies, and recycles the same boss 3 times. I've gone on a bit of a tangent but what this game gets wrong, it gets insanely wrong.I enjoyed this game for the first few hours but it is not polished, it recycles too much content, and it honestly just isn't that satisfying to play. I think people get really hung up on the depth of the character creator and forget that there's an actual game attached to that. I like unique games; this game is ideologically bankrupt. As such, maybe I'm being harder on it than most. But I should not have stuck with it as long as I did. If you must play it, pick it up on sale; it doesn't deserve full price.			"

Recommended,17.8,"																I've been debating writing a review for this game for awhile, but finally have enough alcohol in my system to find it a fun idea.The tl;dr of this is:1) Its a good soul-like game, if you enjoy either soul-like games or anime, you'll most likely enjoy this game2) It has fairly tight combat system, with a bit of clunk and jank here and there, but overall very well developed for this type of game3) Rerolling class is trivial, costs nothing, can be done on a dime, allowing for MASSIVE diversity in play style at any given time with no repercussions4) The story is fairly decent, and at least gives the illusion of story driven choice5) Visually and graphically its very appealing, and several maps (discount Anor Londo, final boss area, destroyed city, etc.) excel at presenting a balanced scale of the world around you, making you feel immersed in that location, instead of just being plopped into generic room x, y, then z6) Extensive, yet somehow limited character creation7) Waifu soulsOverall, I'd give it a, 85-90/100 (a range because one's immediate opinion changes from day to day and combat to combat)Ok, time for the nitty-gritty, and details about the above in no particular order:Pros:Character Builds:It is indeed a good souls like game, with pretty fleshed out and intuitive combat, but these games ALWAYS come with some jank. I, personally, love the fact that you can reroll your build on the drop of a dime, as your spells, equipment weight, and bonus to weapon type are all centered around a blood code, and the stats you gain per level are NOT dependent on your blood code. This means the stats you get from leveling to 70, using blood code A for 1-70, are identical to using blood code B for 1-70. The stats you have are based on an F-S scaling, and immediately change when you switch blood codes, making reroll and trying new builds always possible without penalizing the player. Not being able to allocate stat points may throw some people off, but it is done SO well in this game that I see it as a positive. This especially comes true when each blood code has a myriad of spells/buffs/boons/weapon arts. This means ALL classes get some form of magic/weapon arts, and unlike in Dark Souls #*incoherent mumbling*, magic/weapon arts are USEFUL and makes you feel powerful!Combat:On the whole, the combat is fairly tight and responsive, better than most ""Souls-Like"" games. If you enjoyed Dark Souls #*incoherent mumbling* you'll most likely like this. The weapon variety is not bad, but not very large, ranging from short swords, great showers, axes, pole arms, and guns. All weapons are viable with the right blood code. Spells/buffs/weapon art casts are refilled by attacking and killing enemies, so its a nice balance between forced melee and magic.Story/Aesthetic:The aesthetic is fairly pleasing, and the game has a great sense of scale. Personally, I can't stand anime. I never really had a gripe with it, and used to watch it frequently, but for personal reasons I cannot stand it anymore. Regardless, this game has wonderful aesthetics, even if object clipping and ""flappy"" hair/cloths get in the way of every cutscene. It's very awkward when your staring down the sexy legs of massive dog demon (yes that is a boss) and your hair/cloths are flopping about inside your facemask/head. Regardless, the visual assets I would regard as an overall positive for this game, especially since you get to customize your character. While the customization is fairly limited (compared to games like Black Desert or Saints Row which are way over the top) you do get a fair range of customization alongside the ability to add things like ribbons, earring, neckless, glasses, beards, etc. to any location on your character, which add a nice flair for any given character, especially when you have 3 beards that are upside down. I actually become attached to my character as a result. One thing this game does especially well is the scale of the environment. Simply looking around the destroyed city, or in the arena of the final boss, makes you feel small compared to the world, which is the point!Waifu Souls:Waifu SoulsCons:AI intelligence:This game is not meant to be played alone. You can either play it with friends or with an AI companion, and while I would count this as a Pro as I really enjoyed having a companion, the companion AI is inconsistent. Some companions are just straight up useless, while others are straight up broken. I can't tell you how many times I lose all my HP to have Yakumo (the best waifu) decide its time to roll play as sonic and ******* dodge roll 90 times in a row around a single bottom ***** boy mob while I got through my death animation, completing borking up the change to revive me, while other times, the entire games worth of mobs jump his dumb ***, and he becomes a hybrid between Bruce Lee, Sam Fisher, John Wick, Super Saiyan Shaggy, and Jesus utterly destroying everyone and everything by simply willing it. While it can be funny to watch him wig out around a single mob, its insanely infuriating when a boss is low health, targeting your dying body, and your dumb*** friend is out in B.F.E. doing the Macarena because why not?Combat:When it comes to the jank of combat, there are a few grips I have that cause me to lower the score a bit. I noticed that when I spam the forward basic attack, even when locked on to an enemy, I keep my momentum going forward, which makes sense, but is a massive headache when your slashes go from up to down, and miss the target all the time when using a heavy greatsword. This caused much (and honestly well deserved) frustration at the combat system, which was entirely MY fault. Nonetheless, it was irritating. Backstabbing is a bit broken, and for some reason the devs thought it'd be a good idea to let certain bosses get backstabbed, making the entire fight trivial. Either way, backstabbing is broken. Parrying, on the other hand, is very inconsistent, so much so that I pretty much never use it.Level Design:My last major complaint is discount Anor Londo, the worst level design I think I've ever experienced. Now, I'm, an intelligent guy and have been playing video games for over two full decades, experiencing such ""Dark-Souls"" like games as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Dead Space, Stardew Valley, Diablo, Putt-Putt's Fun Pack, and Raid Shadow Legends. But discount Anor Londo is without a doubt, the worst level design I've ever experienced, its layout is utterly confusing, and its definitely one of the nine circles of hell. I was stuck in some of the towers for over 3+ hours due to the poor map design, intersecting pathways, and overall indistinguishable building design plastered over every pixel. If this area was removed, I'd say that all levels are pretty well made.Biggest complaint:Waifu Souls:Waifu SoulsOverall Code Vein is a very good game, and for anyone who is a Souls fan, it is certainly worth picking up.A few things to note:I have 100% of the achievements, so I've spent some real hellholeish grinding time, and am confident about my complaints.I have completed the story 4 times, and made it to max level.I didn't say anything about the DLC, but overall they add little in way of content, and can completely be skipped with no repercussions.Yakumo is best waifu don't @ me.

Not Recommended,0.7,"																Aw this game is so fun! Detailed character customization, fun & silly over-the-top anime storytelling, frenetic and frantic combat, cool bossess...the works. I'm a big fan of ""souls-like"" games, and this quite a bit better than something like The Surge 2 or some other stuff. Definitely recommended!			"
Recommended,73.4,"																If you don't mind the anime-story, it's a decent souls-like game with some interesting build-making mechanics. It also does some neat things which souls-games could really have used; such as a map which when interacted with gives you a small hint about what you should do next. The game is not great at telling you how combos etc. work, though.+Satisfying Combat+Flexible character building+Character customization-Story (Have not finished it at time of writing, but so far it's very cliché)			"
Recommended,21.3,"																Anime dark souls is good.			"
Recommended,36,"																Had a load of fun playing this game, the parry animations are so satisfying and the combat is awesome. The map showing you where you have already been so you know when you have completely explored an area is sooo good to have, and hilarious when you finish a boss fight and see how much you moved around during it.I do have two problems with this game:1) The camera angles in certain areas make it feel like you're fighting both the game (for example ledges or getting annihilated by a heavy attack from behind an enemy you just killed) and the enemies.2) Sometimes when you're using the lifts in certain areas nothing happens until you open the menu despite the sound effects being played in the background.			"
Recommended,12,"																Backstab: The anime 10/10In all seriousness this is the game that has given me the Souls-like bug. Now I want to play Dark Souls.Code Vein puts more of a focus on the story of the game unlike other Souls-likes, it's kind of like playing a JRPG that plays like Dark Souls. The game starts off very hard but as time goes on things get easier, and you become more skilled at playing the game. Even so death is an ever-present threat, the world of Code Vein is a rough place to live. Sound is great, Graphics are consistent and look in line with what I believe an anime style game to be like, gameplay is satisfying but probably not quite as difficult as other Souls-likes. Some of the map design is questionable and isn't one large interconnected map like say Dark Souls 1, instead CV uses a fast travel system to travel between checkpoints on a bunch maps. The checkpoint system works similar enough to the bonfire system, though the consistency of which they're scattered about each map varies leaving the distance between the Mistles (checkpoints) harder or easier depending upon the map. Code Vein is a good game, I recommend it to those who like Souls-like games, and Anime. That's about what it boils down to.			"
Recommended,37.3,"																What initially seemed like a shallow soulslike entry turned out to be a refreshingly distinct soulslike dungeon crawler. Though character designs sometimes left me scratching my head (Io in particular), the majority of the game has a distinct style to characters, and it's a shame that the same style usually was not present in the environments. The gameplay is very well made, reminiscent of a modernized Dark Souls 2 in pacing. The Blood Codes (Classes) are distinct in style of abilities, but since you can use all abilities across classes it's mostly a stat spread choice, which is nice in a game where abilities expand your range of combos in addition to traditional spells. Overall highly recommended, if you like souls games you will like this one. If you're new to the subgenre there are plenty of options for assistance in NPC followers and multiplayer co-op. The game looks at first glance as something it's not, which is unfortunate, as the game certainly stands out in my eyes as its own game.			"
Recommended,19.8,"																As a long time Dark Souls fan i was really looking forward to this game. And when i played through it for the first time i was absolutly blasted away by how amazing the story of this game was, then i played it a second time a few months later without a compagnion and i was blown away by how amazing the combat in this game really is. This game combines the best things from two of the best games i have every played. An intriguing story with high stakes, character death and extremly efficient drama in a postapocalyptic world, a partner system that makes you actually care about the npc that is running around with you because you get confronted with his (most of the time tragic) back story, and all of that supported by one of the best soundtracks i have ever heard, makes the entire game feel alot like Nier:Automata which then on the other hand gets combined with a fast and flashy soulslike combat which feels alot like bloodborne or dark souls 3. It is the only soulslike i know that actually improved on the format in meaningful ways in form of the bloodcode system, the faster gameplay, and simplifying the whole level up and stat system of the soulslike games without losing the complexity. While its not perfect expecially when looking at the dlcs its still in my opinion the best game i played in 2019 and that includes games like Sekiro, Surge 2 and Nioh which all fall into the same niche. It is easier for new players to pick up than a Souls game because of the compagnion but comes with the same thrill when you play without a compagnion while still staying fair. Absolute must buy if you are a fan of either Nier:Automata or Dark Souls, and probably even a good reccomendation if you have never played any game like that before!			"

Recommended,55.9,"																Its a decent Souls-like, albeit very different from the core series. Its closer to Bloodborne in terms of combat--pace of combat specifically--then there are the skills/class combos which is where this game really shines. Never played God Eater, but Code Vein kinda feels like they smashed a Souls-like together with a Monster Hunter-esque game with spells? which I imagine is what God Eater is like.Ignore the story and characters if you didn't like Tokyo Ghoul (cringey emo anime vampires). I came for the mechanics/combat and I'm thoroughly satisfied. Looking forward to the season pass content!			"
Recommended,15,"																If you're into Souls-style difficult games, this is for you or if you're simply into action games, as well - You can create all kinds of builds and styles to play. Story is decent but I feel it's held back by a lot of tropes you'd find in Anime and the dialogue could be better but it's interesting enough where you can look passed most of it.Give it a shot, it's fun and stylish with great aesthetics and music.			"
Recommended,29,"																Comments only on gameplay, since i never read/watch the story, and finished the game at around 95% (left is to get the medals & achievements whatsoever idc). Throughout gameplay is very satisfying, makes me curses a lot (due to intense difficulty), yet still keeps me playing. Then comes to a point where u have got every items maxed, finished all levels, everything u wanted is there, and all that is left is to walk around killing mobs for fun. And that's it for this game.Coop makes me alive for a couple of ten of hours, but coop itself is pretty much dead. i mean, it would be better if can have pvp, just to mess around with others. but in coop, all u can do is help others, and there aint much people needing help (people helping >>>>> people need help. ratio is very bad over there). so coop is again, pretty much dead. need to wait a lot of time before u can reach people asking for help.Overall is good 8/10. make more missions/explorations for extreme equipment and variety of upgrades, i give it 9/10.make coop pvp and i give it 10/10.			"
Recommended,55.2,"																Code vein is a game about anime vampires and saying the word ""blood"" every five seconds, best experienced when blasting 'Crawling' by linkin park.but in all seriousness though, if you can get past the overall edgelord feel of the game, its amazing.I went into this game completely blind. i heard it was good so i decided to get it. that being said, i have learned a few thingsfirst and formost, a lot of people say this is an anime darksouls game and honestly... its not.Dont get me wrong, yes its difficult at times. but where darksouls is completely unforgiving and just overall relentless in its murder of you, this game is a lot more lax. its much less about you dying to completely insane damage then it is just you dying because you either did something stupid and avoidable or because you need to change how you approach something. by that i mean its a lot of trial and error. the game doesnt hold your hand, it doesnt tell you what to do and what not to do. theres no big glowing eyes on these enemies that say ""hit me here) in big neon letters. you have to find out what works and what doesnt. be it knowing what attacks to dodge, what ones to counter, and what ones to evade, or what weapons, skill set, armor etc you should use.you wont get a feeling of ""oh my god this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" when you die like you would darksouls. youre gonna get a feeling of ""okay that didnt work, so lets try this instead and see what happens""Luckily the game is forgiving with your haze (this games version of souls) in that you just run up and grab them again. honestly ive never lost any haze that i havent recovered.All that being said, normally i dont play these kinds of games. but this one was one that really made me reconsider doing so.It really is a must buy if you like touching storytelling, action, and just feeling like you're actually a badass protagonist in an anime.just mind yourself on the edge less you wish to get cut.

Recommended,13.6,"																When I first read other people's review before purchasing, bunch of them were saying that they were stuck in the character creation menu, at the time I thought they were idiots.In fact after starting the game, I realised, I am also an idiot (and a bigger than average one too).After 4 hours (yes I will pump more hours into this) of creating Waifus (Check my screenshots for them), I have finally started the game...Character creation in Dark Souls 1, 3 or Bloodborne felt like creating a meth addict. So this game automatically gets positive rating just for having the most fun character creator ever!This game is Dark Souls + Bloodborne + Nier Automata + Random anime where they learn the power of friendship for 100th time, combined.Edit:  Finally completed. Bosses like Invading executioner, gilded hunter, agent wolf berserker are fantastic bosses however there are some bosses which feel like they are hard for the sake of being hard. The game reuses a lot of textures and things in the game simply exist to lengthen the playtime for the sake of doing so. In my rating scale anything 5 or above is a positive review, I am rating this 6/10.			"
Recommended,39.3,"																I will compare this game to Dark Souls, so if you don't want to hear that then don't read any further.This game is from the Dark Souls genre and out of all these souls like games that came after Dark Souls the best one in my opinion, mostly because it gives the player many choices and extreme freedom to tweak the game to your own liking. It is clearly much easier than Dark Souls if you want it to be but players can through very simple changes to the game make it much harder without compromising the actual gameplay.In my opinion freedom is the best one word description you could give the game, yes that is an over exaggeration, but the game is built on the concept that the player can change the whole feel of the game on the fly.This brings me to the classes, this game has a ton of different classes and you can change them whenever you feel like it and later on when you used your skills enough to max out their proficiency you can even mix and match different skills from different classes in your build.Now I have some comparisons to make.The fighting is pretty janky in my opinion if you compare it to Dark Souls, I think that is because of the much more active abilities that you can use in Code Vein and that the items take ages to be used is also a factor, you can't just pop a stamina enhancer while fighting, you really need to find the moment when you have a few seconds to yourself.Move sets of weapons vary from weapon to weapon even if it's the same weapon type the same way Dark Souls handles it, but in my opnion the move sets in Dark Souls are more elaborate and interesting than in Code Vein, mostly because you can't really combo heavy and light attacks, so you're pretty much stuck comboing different light attacks, I used probably 10 heavy attacks during my entire playthrough because they just take so much time to end and you don't get more damage out of a heavy attack than if you just do 2 light ones. There are a few weapons that have some special magical attack if you charge the heavy attack, but since the enemies are very prone to jumping around it makes these special attacks easily missable.The game differentiates itself from Dark Souls when it comes to story, Code Vein is foremost a story driven game with some exploration added in. The story itself is very japanese and suffers from accute anime fever, I enjoyed it pretty much, especially that your impression of the world changes several times throughout  the playthrough because of new information you unearthed.There are 3 different endings and wich one you will get depends on very few key choices in the game, most small decisions do not matter, like giving this or that answer to some person. I have to make a remark about the ending I got here, it was sadly pretty disappointing, I got the ""good"" ending and it was very unsatisfying at least for me, I don't know the other endings.So overall I would say a very solid souls like game, it's a little weak in the gameplay and exploration aspect but excels in player freedom and story more than I have seen in any other souls like until now.

Not Recommended,16.5,"																A good action jrpg with a light souls-like feel. Wish there were more varied weapon types, and Depths were more interesting, but besides small things like that an otherwise great game.			"
Not Recommended,22.7,"																This is anime Dark Souls. There are many design choices that copies that of Dark Souls, like the white ""wind wall"" during boss fights, the general feel, the heavy use of church music, etc. There's a lot that's unique to this game as well: 1. The characters are pretty. This is a personal fixation: all games I play must have non-ugly characters, and is one of the main reasons why I didn't like Dark Souls that much (all I see is black). I mean it's a fantasy world. If I can spend 60$ to choose a fantasy world to be in, why would I choose one where everyone is ugly? 2. You can customize your character, heavily. Changing up your look once in a while does help me (and I believe a lot of other folks) extend their enjoyment of the game. 3. It's easier than Dark Souls. You get a companion, who can give revive when you die (to a limit), and they really help in combat. The gameplay is just easier in general as well. TL'DR, the game is recommended for: 1. People who likes Dark Souls. 2. People who don't like Dark Souls, but want something similar. 3. People who is daunted by Dark Souls'd difficulty, and want a ""gateway"" to Souls-like games. 4. People who likes anime, character creation, or pretty characters. 5. People who likes exploration, hidden objects, Metroid-vania. The game is NOT recommended for; 1. People with anime-phobia. (But really, if you look past the anime surface, it's a really good game)2. People who really enjoy Dark Souls' difficulty, and views all other peasants as filthy casuals. In conclusion, good characters, good combat, good music, not enough ""git gud"", 10/10.			"

Not Recommended,130,"																As a long time fans of souls like games I though I might as well leave an evaluation here.Difficulty: This is by far the easiest souls like Ive played Nioh comming on top as the hardest (Yes Midir you are a wimp in comparison to Sanada Yukimura at Max NG+) This said the game becomes harder depending on the build you run. I can tell that as a pure caster character the game did come up to my challange standards in expectations. However the npc system should by all means have stayed optionnal, while I do appreciate for the backup character to save my life quite often the game should have been built around playing solo first then increased in difficulty with a partner. It doesn't have the balls to the walls level of difficulty Nioh NG+ 6 way of the Nioh has but I suspect NG+ content to be very challanging if my indicator are right so far.Builds: The build variety is impressive. While it is locked behind hidden Blood Codes throughout the game this game offers me limitless build possibility. I have played tank pure mage and ranger so far I want to try assassin out sometimes. I can even rebuild on the fly at no costs.Story: The critics either all skipped the memories or didn't care a single for the narative. Probably just another bunch of social justice warrior hating on the oversexualisation of npc and player armor but the truth is this is anime style and that haters gunna hate. Ive played to all 3 dark souls and Nioh and for a game of wich the story is delivered to you through the minds of its characters rather then items this is a welcome change. I wont have to go on some obscure website to understand what the hell is going on here heck I even cried by bits.Character customisation: Between the ass face of dark souls and bloodborn to the no custom of Nioh 1 this character customisation is by far the best one.Extra content: Perhaps my only downside here I'm a little disapointed by the depths but truth be told this product is on a season pass so I'm actualy anticipating an expension pack.Graphics: This is an anime. I expect it to look and play like one. People expecting stunning realistic graphics should hold their expectation back a little.Combat flow: As with anything it depends on your preference. Monsters in code vein tend to take a stupid amount of punishment before they stagger thus making you at risk of getting interupted when using skill. Use that poise ERR balance to keep them from flinching while and youl get to enjoy those combos to the fullest.			"

Pleasantly surprised, thank u devs.Edit:After finally giving multiplayer a shot last night to get the extra skill, I can honestly say that its not in a good state. Out of around 20-30 matches nearly half of them were disconnects before even getting to their world and over half of the games I played when I did go in were incredibly laggy, not to mention they don't even give you a millisecond after killing a boss to say goodbye to the new friend you just made and instantly throw you back in your world. What I can say is that when the connection was good, it was really fun... but I wouldn't recommend it as it is.			"
Recommended,50.5,"																Bandai Namco really played this one smart. They copied the controls, combat and gameplay straight out of Dark Souls 3 (Bonfires, equipment, souls that you lose on death, etc), took the fast paced combat from Bloodborne, and threw a bucket of anime paint at it. The result is a surprisingly fun take on the souls style game.If you enjoyed Dark Souls 3 and like Anime, this is a no brainer. You will have a great time with this game.Other notable points:1. The character customization is very in depth, although I'd like to see more clothes and the ability to change your character's proportions (chest size, height, etc).2. Every piece of armor you equip has its own unique drain attack. This can range from something that looks like the demon parasite from The Darkness to a succubus tail that stabs people. Its a fun twist.3. The game runs like a dream, no performance dips and feels as responsive as Dark Souls 3. The only odd thing is the character sometimes continues moving after you let off the analog stick, like the floor is slippery. Research indicates this is a bug at 144 fps, so setting to 60 fps may fix the issue.Overall, highly recommend.			"
Recommended,100.8,"																The mix of God Eater and Dark Souls. I have been following its news since AX 2018 when it was announced to release last September but postponed. I have to say the one year extra is worth the wait. Sure this won't be like how Sekiro does to the genre which introduces a whole lot of the new stuff. But Bandai Namco at least know how to copy homework, and they know how to do it well unlike the usual ""failed soul-like copycat that can't discern bad design from challenging design"". As far as my few hours of experience goes, it makes me remember the good old times of playing Dark Souls and Dark Souls II. If ""prepare to die"" is not what you like, fear not as the game also lets you bring a companion to greatly reduce the suffering for casuals.Moreover, it has plenty of anime waifus and that is awesome.

This is much quicker game play with an interesting stat system via blood codes.I guess its Nioh mixed with Devil May Cry, especially if you play with AI tagging along. Gets harder when playing solo.Still waiting to see how much loot is in the game or if theres just various versions of the same gear.

It was already controversial enough that they run Dunovo a well known performance impacting tool that often punishes paying customers and has alleged concerns of being flagged as spyware by popular AV tools. Would have loved to enjoy this game but I can't justify recommending to people a game that simply has zero support service and also look beyond Dunovo which is likely what is causing my inability to play as a normal paying customer.

Recommended,87.1,"																Yeah I'm sorry but this is the one case I have no clue what the main line reviewers are on about. This game has been great so far and for someone like me who doesn't really care for character creation this time around the character creator made me sit there for the first 2 hours, it's that good.I personally stayed away from souls like games and never got into them but this may be the game to peak my interest. I can already feel so far it's a tad bit easier than the first hours of dark souls 3 and with the companions I see this being a great beginners game to play before trying out the real souls games.Overall so far I'd say this is a 8/10 with the combat, artstyle and character creation alone. I don't expect much from the story but if I end up enjoying it this could easily be a 8.5 or 9.			"
Recommended,24,"																I really wanted to like this game, but it falls short in too many ways. Buy it if it's $5 on sale, but otherwise don't waste your money.The only enjoyable part of the game were the short stories of the supporting characters, but the main overall story was severely lacking in depth and any explanation. If you think the game play mechanics would make up for the story, you'd be disappointed (like me). Sure, it's a difficult game and you'll die lots of times learning the enemies and boss's moves, but once you do it's the same thing for the rest of the game, enemies are literally just re-textured very early on.Other Annoying Things to Note:- You pick your character's voice, and they say maybe two lines the entire game. The rest is just an awkward silent camera pan.- The amount of classes/blood codes is overwhelming, and you'll be grinding forever to unlock everything. - The secret ending is a black screen and one word.

Recommended,40.2,"																Very cool soulslike game. It has a good and exciting story and offers a unique playstyle for everyone. I've read many reviews that this game is ""way to easy"" yes it actually is, if you play it with one of the partners. If you want a challenge beat it without one and it will be twice as hard. The levels are awesome, some of them are a bit short but they look amazing. I loved the uniqe talents, the characters, how they develop in the story and of course the bosses. Never had so much fun in a single player game since a long time. THE CHARACTER CREATION IS AWESOME, I played as Nico Robin lol.There is nothing I can really hate about this. At first the controls where very scuffed for me but after some time it became acceptable. Idk if it is just me but the loading screens are waaaaaaaaaay too long, but the memory fragment scenes where cool. But it took some time. If you want to take a look, play the demo.Well I definitely recommend this for every DarkSouls and Anime Fan and I'm looking forward for another sequel of this series. The game offers to replay the whole story, will definitely do that. Have fun with the game guys.			"

Recommended,7.3,"																Probably my favorite souls-like that's not by FromSoftware. Its a theorycrafter's dream, most skills from classes are transferable, so you are incentivized to train other classes for new skills. You can change your skills at any time, at no cost.Multiplayer matching is well done, though the process is not explained much in-game. I typically play solo, which allows you to play with an AI companion.Art and music are fantastic.			"

Recommended,23.2,"																This fun and charming entry in the ""souls like"" genre brings great ideas and characters.Vampire like beings team up together to save the world.The gothic anime art style sets this game apart and gives a unique feel.The combat feels both familiar and fresh.You have your heavy and quick attacks, parry, dodge and block.Each weapon has a different style special move, think Monster Hunter. You also have a drain ability, which also has its own set of variant moves.Code veins does a great job of creating a flexible class system.Classes are called Blood Codes and can be swapped in the inventory.You can play all of the game as a tank and switch to cast for the final boss without issues.Now that statement is not really 100% true.As each class has different abilities and passives you can unlock.Once an ability is unlocked you master it by playing that class.Mastered abilities can be used with others classes, allowing you to mix and match.This system lets you create your own play style and helps make your character your own.The world is fun to explore and well crafted, with powerful enemies stalking the maze like areas.Unlike the game it was inspired by, the worlds story is told in a more coherent way.You will have an NPC partner to help you along the adventure.This NPC will comment of the world and enemies you fight.Explaining the lore and giving you advice.When it comes to story, expect your standard anime cliches and melodrama.Amnesia, deep life and death theories, etc.This is by no means a bad thing as the story is still great.Maybe I'm just a softy, but by the end of the first boss battle I had a tear rolling down my cheek.Not from frustration by the way, but I wont spoil any of the story.This game deserves the praise for being a great addition to the genre.Give this game a chance and try out the demo.

Both are technically optional, so, just putting that out there for consideration.My only issue is there's a bug with the mouse pointer that still hasn't been fixed.			"
Recommended,78.5,"																Every story thread has a mystery of some kind.While the main plot relies on cutscenes, many of the individual characters' stories play out through blood echoes, slow-moving story sequences where you walk (very slowly) through corridors with still images that sync up to audio logs. I don’t have a problem with this kind of secondary storytelling, but I wish that more of these more interesting stories could have been better integrated into the main plot, rather than bringing the pace to a crawl to develop its characters and deliver important details about the world.For all its twists and turns, most of the story in Code Vein feels very separate from what you actually do. You spend hours and hours exploring the labyrinthine caverns and city ruins of the revenant world, cutting through enemies (referred to as the Lost) in typical Soulslike fashion. If you’ve played any of these games – Dark Souls, Bloodborne, The Surge (or The Surge 2, which also came out this week) – you know the drill. There are save points called Mistle that recharge your healing item; Each twisty, turny level has shortcuts that allow you to bypass certain sections when you have to work your way back to where you died; combat demands precision, requiring you to play cautiously, dodge often, and choose your moments.That said, your options extend far beyond the average stick-and-move tactics I’ve cultivated from years of playing similar games. Your character has an effectively unlimited capacity to invent and reinvent him or herself by changing their class, called a “Blood Code,” at any time. Each one has its own profile with stats that scale to your level in different ways, proficiencies for different weapons, including old standbys like heavy-hitting giant swords and polearms, as well as some unique options like the Bayonet, which has a magic-powered gunshot as its heavy attack. Each class also offers a set of special abilities called Gifts that, when paired with a certain set of specs, create a relatively distinct spin on your character.I found it essential to change Blood Codes and strategies to beat certain tough enemies.While the 25 classes I found don’t feel all feel unique – truly, they boil down to magic-users, rogues, and tank archetypes – by mastering their gifts you can mix and match skills and stat variations, turning each Blood Code into a unique loadout. Active Gifts run the gamut of typical RPG abilities, from buffs like Iron Will (which enhances your defense), situational skills like Venom Trap (which poisons enemies), and attack spells like Draconic Stake (which launches a spike made of blood at your enemy): As your repertoire of Blood Codes grows, you build a sizable array of options.Though you can often get by with focusing on just one or two, I found it essential to change Blood Codes and strategies to beat certain tough enemies. After going toe-to-toe with an early boss in a heavy armor class and getting crushed consistently, I was able to quickly dispatch it simply by switching to long-range class with support skills and a gun to keep me away from its poison-laced attacks. Switching tactics, especially when you’re figuring out how to apply said tactics to the attack patterns of a powerful boss, can be really tough to wrap your head around, but it's often a puzzle worth solving. Above all, I found it freeing that Code Vein gives you permission to try lots of different options with no penalty.It also helps that you have a partner to take the edge off. Code Vein’s other primary innovation is its reliance on playing with an AI-controlled partner, one of the other revenants from your team with their own Blood Codes and fighting styles. Since you can’t control them, I found it better to think of each one as a complement to your own loadout. When using a heavy class, for example, I preferred bringing along the team’s leader, Louis, who uses quick attacks and magic. But when I switched to a long-range class, I liked fighting alongside Yakumo, the resident brawler. In combat, each fighter’s unique skills feel more or less compatible, which makes me feel more or less connected to them. It’s on you to figure out how best to take advantage of their skills, though often it's okay to simply let them keep some of the enemies off your back while you fight.Having a partner changes the flow of combat, usually for better but sometimes for much, much worse. The good part is that because you’ll often fight groups of enemies – three or four at a time is pretty common – having a second character on your side makes each battle feel more epic as fighting goes on around you too. At the same time, once you get the hang of the controls, most fights are less stressful because you have a bit of a safety net.Your capacity to defeat many of Code Vein's harder bosses comes down to how your inconsistent AI partner happens to perform.When the going gets really tough, though, things fall apart. Most of the AI partners are relentlessly aggressive and can’t really read enemy attack patterns, which means that in boss battles they will inevitably die if you don’t protect or heal them. And once they die, more often than not you'll end up dying as well without their help, even if you were just using them to get a little breathing room. That means your capacity to defeat many of Code Vein's harder bosses comes down to how your inconsistent partner happens to perform in a given attempt, which adds a frustrating amount of randomness to a game where combat otherwise emphasizes skill by asking you to time your attacks and dodges perfectly.You can take the AI ally out of the equation entirely if you want, but that makes things so much more difficult that I think the tradeoff is ultimately worth keeping them around. Technically you can play through the whole 30-hour campaign solo, though I wouldn’t recommend it. Given the number of enemies and the speed  of some of the bosses, I found playing alone far harder than dealing with the AI's issues. Companions are also part of what makes Code Vein interesting, and if you care deeply about the story, your partners will keep you up to date on what’s going on even after long stretches without a major event or cutscene.There’s also a limited, Dark Souls-style co-op option where you can summon another player for short-term support. That said, without any real matchmaking or even the ability to sync up with friends, I wouldn’t expect to play the whole game that way.Source: IGN			"
Recommended,36,"																After completing this I'd recommend the game but I'll have to give it a solid 7. Visuals were pretty good, story was bland, gameplay could have been more polished. It was not the game I hoped it would be and that's my opinion. people can assume I'm hating but I've played all types of souls-likes including the souls series in full. This missed the mark in my opinion and I'm glad I got it for 40 bucks elsewhere. Most of the game I was just frustrated and a lot of the time when completing something that was ""challenging"" I wasn't even satisfied and had lingering frustration/anger even after moving forward. Nothing better than the way it feels after beating a boss or a challenging situation when it's done right and not seemingly trying it's hardest to make you lose with artificial difficulty. Too bad I guess. On to the next game.			"
Recommended,76.3,"																Fully enjoyed the game. Its suitably difficult without being full on Hate-Boner with its relentless efforts to kill you. Badies can and will kill you easily if you dont learn their patterns, bosses are no different. The big thing that stands apart from the other Souls-Like games is that the moves the badies throw at you arnt next to impossible to judge. In Dark Souls, the timings and animations are not synced up in a way that makes sense, so you have to learn its terrible sync timings. Not so in Code Vein. Badie swinging at you? Move. Badie misses you 100%. Bosses also rarely have sweeping attacks that obliterate all the HP you have, and cover 270 degree arcs. Unlike Dark Souls, this game plays fair, and that can mean its ""easier"" then others. Started NG+ to see how things increase with difficulty, and I gotta say its a bit more on par with the mind crushing, HP bar deleting attacks that Souls-Like games are known for. Getting two shot (at lvl 150) by the most basic badie in the game is a fair bit more punishing then first time though. Partners also are a good bit less effective. Some of them are just as tanky, but they dont seem to scale as well as the rest of the game, leaving their damage output much lower. Equipment is still maxed at +10 (so far, I dont see that changing), and regeneration is at it limit even though you can still find the items that increase it (if you missed some the first time though). The big thing I do like is that the map is fully explored to the limit you revealed first time though. This is a nice thing have kept in, as it limits the aimless wandering that happened initially. Shortcuts are all closed and the Mistls you can ""rest"" at need to be activated.Solid 8/10			"

Recommended,17.2,"																Aside from the character creator this game is mediocre. Combat is jank due to either no animation cancel or input lag and very poor enemy attack telegraphing.For it's year of release it is graphically inferior to many other games released, looks literally like a God Eater 3 reskin. The bullets you shoot look like a block line of pixels, the weapons are not visually unique or striking, and the environments are lifeless. Level design is unnecessarily convoluted sometimes and other times mind numbingly linear.The absolute worst aspect is the story telling gimmick where you walk down a hallway while statues tell you a story about the character youre interested in and it happens for every character. You just press W to continue for each of these sections that take like 5mins, it is incredibly lazy. If youre looking for a an anime reskin of game concepts done better else where, with clunky gameplay but an awesome character creator this is for you, but reign in your expectations for just about everything else, because everything else is just serviceable. Personally ""serviceable"" doesn't get a recommendation from me, because at base things you buy should serve the purpose you buy them for.			"

Recommended,22.2,"																I've played a TON of souls-likes and while this game is polished, it's still without a doubt the worst of the lot. Balancing is a disaster and that becomes more apparent than ever during boss fights. This game was designed to have the player use the AI Co-Op partner supporting you at all times so deciding to play Solo is a death sentence as you will be enormously punished for this.

Recommended,57.6,"																Amazing game. If you like Dark Souls, and anime, this game will be for you. It it souls-like, but it handles mechanics/controls differently than souls, enough to make it stand on its own. Instead of distributing stats, you simply only need to level up, and stats come from different ""Blood Codes"" that you can obtain and equip whenever you like. Each one grants new abilities for your character, and you can master most of these abilities to throw on another Blood Code. Story seems a bit cheesy at first, but I got pretty invested in it as I progressed further.			"
Recommended,43.1,"																Wasn't too difficult the get a hang of the mechanics and learn the systems in the game. Combat is fun if you know what you're doing and can be somewhat of a challenge at times. Even if you're meeting the same enemy while you're slogging about the map, killing them never gets tiring. I love the parry system the most, and always aim to punish an attack, makes me feel like a boss at times, and the different blood veils can convey that feeling quite well. The class system is quite extensive and I like how once you've mastered a skill it's universally available no matter what blood code you adopt. This provides ample opportunity to mix and match passive and active skills into a build, which leaves a lot of room for experimentation. Depending on blood code, blood veil, weapon selection, and skill choice, you end up with a unique approach to how you play the game.The companion system is also nice, pretty decent and intelligent as far as AI go. Will always be quick to provide healing should your health hit zero and the damage they can do to enemies also makes them very useful team mates in fights.Character creation is pretty good, though I would have liked to have character height and more body modification available. There are definitely a lot of options in other areas though that allow the player to create a unique avatar. One minor criticism though is that I wish we could toggle masks visuals on/off outside home base. I mean yes, for story purposes you know why they need to wear masks, but sometimes I just don't want to see it being worn; the same goes for blood veils as well. As for graphics and sound, they do their respective jobs well. Environments are nice, and sound effects are decent. Texture pop-in still happens in some occurrences even on max. Music can get a tad repetitive especially during those memory sequences with Io, but it's done well nonetheless. I think it was a good purchase all and all.			"
Recommended,66.4,"																Another proof that anime tiddies indeed make everything better. Just make sure to watch some ""Tips and trick"" videos, some things like the non-charged drain attack are not explained very well in the tutorial.Especially make sure to collect all the vestiges when you get to the successors, doing so will ... (minor spoiler) ... unlock the ability to inheirt their blood code by speking to them after they stonify in the memory, orherwise you will get a part of the queens blood code if you exit the memory throught the gate.Other than that it is a very engaging game to play, Finished it after 50h and I will probably replay it at least once.

Not Recommended,25.9,"																Anime Dark Souls is a fitting description but it's so much more imo. After 100%ing the game, I feel this game exceeds Dark Souls. This coming from someone that has 100% Dark Souls 1+2 and stopped at 75%ish for Dark Souls 3 because I got bored.Combat-wise, this rolls all over Dark Souls. So many abilities and builds to use. It's not just spam light and heavy attack for melee. Magic? Far more spells to use. It's just more fun.Story? It's not cryptic/hidden away. There are actual cut scenes. Characters that you could connect with and hate. Moments that could evoke some kind of emotion out of you if you're not a heartless sob. The different endings are a nice touch as well, though there's only one true ending that sets up a sequel because of course there would be one. Graphics? Decent. It's not going to wow you but it doesn't have to. These kinds of games were never about being the prettiest on the market. This has positive effects on performance as I am able to hit my capped fps of 141 consistently @ 1440p maxed on a 1080 ti. One last thing - there is no pvp but there is coop similar to how it works in Dark Souls. Whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on each person. Overall this is a great game. If you're a fan of the Souls and similar games, I highly recommend it!EDIT: I nominated this for GOTY in the 2019 Steam Awards :)			"
Not Recommended,6.6,"																 SUMMARY Embark on a journey of blood and destruction to uncover most memories and escape a true nightmare. A story-driven anime action-RPG game where you can play alone or with a friend. An interesting combo of God Eater and Dark Souls in anime disguise that you may be interested to play. It felt a bit too expensive for what it has to offer, so maybe better wait for a sales event. INFO - This review is a personal opinion. Try the game for yourself.- Game was played on max graphics setting and ultrawide resolution.- Depending on your gaming experience background, the game can be either entertaining or boring. PROS - An acceptable story with decent graphics.- Interesting anime art-style and nice exploration features.- Good soundtrack and good cinematics.- Enough classes to choose from with a large variety of builds.- Interesting drain mechanic.- Decent leveling system (albeit not really required to complete to max in order to finish the game or kill the Crypt Spire boss).- Co-op (two player) available (or play with an AI companion).- Plenty of collectibles and secret paths. CONS - Partial ultrawide support (cutscenes have side black bars).- At times, the story becomes a little cheesy and uninteresting.- Voice acting is not a strong point.- Combat can be fun for a while, but it is rather stationary, unsatisfying and does not feel fluid and dynamic, it's somehow like hitting sponges, you don't feel like hitting the target, not really what you would expect from an action-RPG.- After a while, exploration and missions become borring. At least for me.- Not the best optimization, you can feel that even on high-end PCs.- Some levels are trully a maze, difficult to understand and travel through.- Map directions can be very confusing, some of them have a bad design.- Season pass and 3 payed DLCs that should have been part of the base package.- Could not join anyone in multiplayer.- Suitable for anime fans.

Recommended,16.9,"																What do I love about this game and why am I recommending it? Here's a few reasons:- incredible character customization. I have never played a game with so many customizable physical characteristics, clothing and accessories. and the option to save multiple core physical traits and multiple clothing/accessory loadouts, separately. But it doesn't stop there. Nexus mods has great clothing and character mods. If you like character customizatoin, making every detail exactly how you want it, especially making super hot bombshell female characters, that other games think aren't appropriate, you've found the mother ship for this.-Next, graphics. WoW! incredible art design coupled with incredible graphical quality. I'm not an anime fan, but other than some of the NPCs looking fairly anime, your own character doesn't have to (your choice) and the monsters and the world certainly DOES NOT!! This game is so visually appealing. Recommend a couple Nexus mods to enhance shaders and there is another one that amplifies graphics with max Draw Distance, sharper, higher resolution, more shadows, max quality textures and boosted TAA, plus more.-Fighting is super fun, especially if you experiment with all the different builds and abilities. This game has a complex attribute system with many possible build/gear combinations. It also has the ability to upgrade and change stats on weapons and gear, which allows you to dial in builds, if you want to geek out.-It's challenging at times, but not over the top like Dark Souls are Sekiro. Save points come often enough that if you die, it's not the end of the world, but enough of an inconvenience to try super hard not too! Also you can go grab your dropped cash upon death so you don't lose anything.-The story is actually really good! I'm enjoying the story and feeling some emotional connection to some of the main characters. However, one downside is that your own character doesn't talk, just nods , shakes head, etc. which results is zero emotional connection to my own character. It's strange because there are so many conversational and other amazing cutscenes, like HUNDREDS, and if only my character spoke, it might have made it to one of my favorite games ever!

I don't know why Code Vein does this kind of save system when deleting them in the game doesn't actually get rid of them. It's like the only game I have that does this...

Recommended,199.1,"																Code Vein is a game I wish I enjoyed more. With tight gameplay and incredible build variety, the game hooked me in quickly. I loved most of the bosses, and the world is an interesting one. However, the story and characters are quite honestly laughable, and I was appalled to see the AAA voice cast for this game after experiencing such amateurish performances from them. Co-op made the experience much better, as me and a friend were able to point and laugh at all the contrivances and soapy delivery of lines. I will say I liked it a lot, but the game tries too hard to be like Dark Souls and fails at every attempt, to the point where I just can't overlook it. However, in those brief moments I was able to ignore the comparison to Dark Souls, the game was an absolute blast, and the story would probably be less laughable if I used the Japanese voices. 7.5/10.			"
Recommended,24.2,"																I heard this game was difficult, but I didn't realize my first boss would be figuring out the little nuances to get multiplayer to actually work.

Recommended,10.1,"																I've tried 3 times to enjoy Code Vein but I just can't. Maybe I'm just too critical of souls-likes but it's got way too much jank that no amount of positive points could ever make up for it.Pros:- The absolute best character creation I've ever seen in my entire life- Story and themes are super intriguing but I didn't make it far enough to actually rate it properly- The Blood Code system is amazing and I would LOVE to see more of that in other games. Having the option to pretty much change your class at any point in the game to encourage versatility and build exploration is such a cool mechanic.Cons:- Janky as hell. A 2019 game shouldn't be this clunky. Inconsistent backstab, lots of inputs not registering properly resulting in various frustrating situations, inconsistent dodges, etc- A LOT of enemy attacks have ZERO wind up which makes it virtually impossible to react to some attacks- Mob density = artificial difficulty and this game has loads of it. Enemies, group composition and bosses don't feel thought of at all. It just feels like they crammed the same enemies everywhere as much as they possibly could and call it a day.- Controller mapping. As of 2019 there are TONS of soulslike with virtually all the same controls but they somehow decided to just attribute random actions to random numbers with some controller buttons not being remmapable properly so you can't get the usual ""Light attacks on R1 and heavies on R2"" for some reason			"

"
Recommended,10.7,"																I've put in an embarrassingly amount of time into a game I thought I was going to ultimately dislike. I'm not super big into Souls games, just didn't catch onto the hype of them at the time.. and Elden Ring looked interesting-ish.. but again, burned out on open-world lazy-writing games. SOOO I saw this on a discount and just went with it.. I haven't really gotten into anime games in a loooong time. Last good one was Vindictus, but I despise p2w and I only really liked the combat... so here's to me hoping this game could give me that combat!This has all the usual tropes.. young girl + big boobs + skimpy clothing to start you off. *SHRUGS* BUT, the game was actually alright. I wanted to scratch the itch of a fast-pace fighting. It actually does that a bit, yeah. Bosses are friggin' brutal in this game and damn satisfying to finally take down on my totally-first-try *coughs usually 6+ tries...*. I could make a cute vampire guy to slay all the things with and totally just stare at all the men to spite the game and its insistence of boobas in my face. Decent anime-character creator, though very limited in outfits. Made me a bit sad. The character creator felt one of the most hyped things about the game and it was just fine? Like it wasn't the most amazing thing ever they made it out to be. Music/Sound was pretty good, well cept all the opera vocal stuff.. get really tired of anime and their light-hearted music with sadlyrics being classified as 'dark and moody'. Japan really needs to understand 'dark and moody' more. The environments were pretty nice, simple corridor action but I liked it. The sounds were nice and crunchy, especially the finisher moves. Those were a lot of fun visually too! Pulling them off on the other hand will take a lot.. A LOT of practice.. and even then you'll still fail too much. Parry system was just, it was harsh.. doable, but definitely hard. And if you pull it off at the right time on some bosses? Holy hell that was satisfying indeed! ...most of the time you'll probably just get smacked.. but its worth it when it works! Overall, I think this guilty-pleasure game is pretty good for the combat alone and if you like to make cute anime boys.. okay and girls too, we know we know.. you guys aren't exactly NOT pandered to. :P Still, it gave me options and I enjoyed that for what it was worth. I admittedly didn't beat the game yet, I got to the last zone and honestly.. I got burnt out after attempting the opera-singer boss lady. She was TOUGH as hell. Guess I shouldn't of insulted the opera lyrics so much.. lol. Still, then I got distracted. I'm sure I'll come back around to this game though to finish it proper like. I did have a lot of fun.In the end, grab it on a discount and enjoy some pretty anime characters turned evil and biting everything with strange armor-blood powers.. or something. ITS FUN! Crunchy fast-paced combat is fun!			"

Recommended,30.2,"																The world of code vein is truly amazing!Hard souls-like game combined with anime like style is perfect for any anime lovers and gamers searching for challange. Beautifull wiews, emotional storyteling and good game mechanics. Just completed it fully and im gonna say, the story will make you cry.StoryPost apocaliptic world facing with lost onslaught, revenants trying to survive in brutal world, and you trying to beat this one annoying boss. the game's lore have a lot of story to offer and is mostly focused on revealing the truth about the vein. The choices you make have a meaning, and the actuallydefine ending you will get, out of 3 possible, your actions will make a difference.MusicThe music in this game is the most marvelous thing you will hear, from the choir welcoming you to the game, to the best ending songs in game industry! The game developers realy did their best making music that gives you thrilling feeling while fighting lost or gets very emotional while experiencing a  revenant's memory.GameThe game itself may prove to be hard, like... very hard. You need to be cautious even while fighting normal enemies on the map. There may be times where you WILL rage quit, but trust, everyone was at this point. Forcing you to learn the pattern of the attacks if you really want to defeat enemies you approach, while still trying not to die from sisyphus-like healing. You have wariety of weapons to choose and fair amound of blood codes that are basically classes that you can freely change. So, read the pattern, die, improve your strategy with different class, repeat until it dies.CharactersCharacters in vein world have their own little charm, a responsible leader trying his best, kind defender making sure you are safe, or your own character that you spent multiple hours customizating. Code vein offers rather big amound of customization for your character so creating character you desire is indeed a posibility here. Characters emotions together with their ambiotions and determination to resolve their past selfs creates a feeling where all of them are needed for game's lore.Finishing it up, the game is a very good choice if you search for challenging games with good story natural enviroment will make you want to stay in the game for a long time. 9/10			"

Recommended,12.4,"																the graphics in this are really satisfying. he maps can be really frustrating. the customization gives so many options especially the accessories. the story was so-so to me, but regardless it was still good, although towards the end, i kind of lost interest just a bit.however, ill be honest, there are few things that stopped from enjoying this to the fullest, seeing 4 male companions and the ability to play as a female gave me a a bit of a different impression i guess, but the game really seems like it was made with male player in mind in most ways.All the Relic holders that need saving are female except for a little boy, now that's not a problem of course, except it gives me very much saving ""damsels in distress"", and i didnt like that at all, but thats just me.  Also the Devs really didnt hold back with making most of the female characters ""features"" very big, that also isnt a problem i guess, except that the male characters didn't get the same attention with their features. i wont say exactly what but im sure its fairly obvious.""Io"" the relics attendant was just one example and was just too much, but i liked her character though. anyways the game is still recommended because it wasn't bad.

Recommended,62.3,"																Pretty good game, love the character customization and interesting story telling concept of going through the memories of the characters. Combat feels good too and the gameplay doesn't feel too grindy or hard, its just right i guess. However, the map exploration is pretty simple and not too challenging, would be nice to have like puzzles mechanics and more hidden secrets in certain areas. I'm gonna try to get the other endings from now on.			"
Recommended,41.9,"																I really like the coop expect despite the janky coop design, only the loading screen create inconvenience. Otherwise another banger made by Bandai Namco, I really like how me and my bro overcome many dangers and tribulation together though like Elden Ring, he is the better player around.This game is hard, but fair. Checkpoint isn't a going to be a guess work, but it really make you work for it. Weapon scaling is unbalance as heck, causing certain weapon to be more meta build like the blade polearm that use sweep attack. Making aggressive inchor attack more flashy and utility than just using weak and strong attack, a lot of enemies can teleport, which is pain to deal with, luckily the coop aspect make the journey is pleasant difficult rather than just horrendous.The in game story is what i really enjoy, it tells a cohesive and intrigue story despite pack with anime action, this is also the very first game where Shift make your choice of gameplay having consequences to the overall plot, lore and ending, which to me really a big shift of how I view Japanese anime games. where you can actually get the bad ending. It felt like you are part of a anime where you are a person in that world with others. The cutscene replay really makes the experience great despite you barely spoke anything in the entire game, you are still relevant in the in game plot. I enjoyed the English dub as they are overall a pleasant experience, I will probably play it again in the original Japanese audio.Bandai Namco made a really good anime souls like here, i am no big fan of Souls like but the fact Swift made God Eater 1,2 and then greatly expand their anime game design expertise in this, they came a long way. Above that they really made a very good PC Online Coop game where the limitation is just the loading screen and the fact your coop partner cannot re-explore areas after the boss is beaten, otherwise it is another real banger made by Swift under Bandai Namco, I clearly underestimated they are a force to be reckon with in the gaming world.

Recommended,200.3,"																See here's the problem with Dark Souls. There were hardly any anime tropes or those endowed with comically large chests(except Gwynevere).

Recommended,37.8,"																The Gameplay: It's a flashy but somewhat clunky Souls like that gets the job done. The systems border on being fun to tedious depending on when and where you are with them. It's honestly a tossup that you will probably either hate or love depending on where on the spectrum of gaming you are on. In my experience this game is a lot more fulfilling as coop game, which is a huge plus. It is however a solid experience all things considered and gets the job done.The Story:The setting is much more interesting than the actual story in this case.Want to be a cool anime vampire character that fights monsters? Cool! But it is also laden with many of the tropes that come with your more basic anime stories revolving around friendship and screaming out the important persons name to highlight that said person is very important. I feel like a jerk for this, but I think that the worst/sad ending path seems to be the most interesting and have the most emotional impact overall.The Visuals:This is the part where they more or less knock it out of the park. The characters are beautiful. Your customization options are so in depth that you could spend countless hours just making characters and be totally content. My only visual gripe is that the weapons look like toys and seem to lose any impact if they are big or point looking since every weapon looks extreme.The Sound:The musical score is a very very nice touch and accentuates the Gothic horror vibe this game wants to have. The voice acting is also done well enough to be pleasant to listen through. The only thing ruining that is how flat some of the characters are written. All in all very solid.The Experience:The game as a whole is a good experience that I could recommend for a good time. It is not super high on my list of recommendations though, but there nonetheless. As one of the few story games that has coop it does have a place in my library and it was used to great effect for that purpose, It had some cringe moments but it also had plenty that made up for it. I imagine for some this can go either way due to the game-play aspect, but I don't think the game is bad by any means.. it just also isn't something that will take my breath away.			"

Recommended,152.8,"																On my second run, i can say something about the game.First off: the game is so great it's addictive, the combat system is flashy and complete, with many possible situations, somewhat tight timings, and plenty of room for building your own strat, thanks to gifts (this game's equivalent to skills). Speaking of strategy, i noticed how every single boss plays about the same, with only some (sometimes minor, sometimes major) differences in the moveset, but all around it's all a roll-make whiff-punish loop over and over, granted you have to adjust it with your specific build and choice of skills. The amount of possibility regarding making your own build is outstanding. with stats for just about anything you would want to touch, such as mobility, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of defense parameters, and TWO different stats for basic attacks, among other things. Never i have felt ""forced"" to play in a specific way for lack of customization in my build, granted i had achieved all the required components, which is a pleasurable form of grind. The maps are i believe the weakest point in the game, each one of them being very, very anonymous and plain, except for some spectacular exceptions, particularly maze-like maps, which can be annoying but have genius level design where you are in fact able to tackle on enemies, and yet never once you feel like you're truly in control. This is the kind of vibe i wish the entire game had. The soundtracks and japanese voice acting are all amazing, albeit i can't speak for the english dub. The choice of weaponry is somewhat lacklustre, but i feel like 5 main weapon classes with each one of them having wildly different weapons in the same class can be ok. All in all, this game should deserve way more love than it gets, and if you're a fan of anime action rpgs, this might have you occupied for a while.			"

Recommended,40.4,"																Multiplayer keeps kicking out friend when we need to heal or die and waiting on a 5 min loading screen to get them back into the game with me each time something happens the game doesn't like is a real kill joy of the game. I'm not terrible impressed and it was more frustrating then anything.....I thought Genshin Multiplayer was bad .....til now LOL			"
Recommended,109,"																After beating the game I can confidently say that ""Blade Bearer"" is a terrible designed boss, completely overturned and compared to any other boss the most unbalanced one in the game.The rest of the game, in particular story, characters and level design (Cathedral!) is absolutely amazing. It is however very easy to get lost, and not knowing where to go next to progress the story. Just the ending felt very unsatisfying.Top tier character customization.			"
Recommended,4.1,"																Ultimately wanted to play for the co-op experience, what I read online was that you had a full co-op experience in CODE VEIN but what I got was the complete oppossite.First off, joining each other was easy enough but we soon enough realised that the person who joins cannot interact with anything in the world. You can't level up in the co-op session and can't rest at checkpoints. Whenever the person joining dies they get set back to their own world and has to join back again. When the host dies you also get disconnected but the host has to open up the lobby again.This essentially means you have to play through the game twice, on your own and with a friend. 3 hours was enough to come to the realisation that this wasn't worth my time.

Recommended,12.7,"																Honestly, I started off hating this game, and it still sucks in many way, but there is something about it that kept me coming back. It was the anime aesthetic and best girl Mia.Bad parts: The combat is a good bit worse than dark souls as animations are a bit more stiff, and enemy variety is really limited.The level design is pretty bland except a couple of the end game areas, best bet is to just traverse the level by always turning left at an intersection.The story is very anime which might be a turn off for some people but not to me, figured I would mention it here too.Dialogue proceeds rather slowly and there is a lot of ""dead air"" between voiced lines.The game does not respect your time due to above, slow ""walking cutscenes"" (which are optional) and the terrible time wasting achievements.There is too much blatant boobage for my tastes.The Good:Character customization is really good if anime edge is what you want.The story is surprisingly heartfelt and engaging, its take on (essentially) vampires feels reasonably unique.Characters are funI personally really like the AI partner system, both in the help they give in battle and the small quips they make during exploration (though you can play without companions, and turn off the exploration quips). Creating builds is incredibly easy as there is a ton to choose from, and respecing can be done at literally any time.Active and passive skills and buffs feel incredibly useful and are a ton of fun (and are flashy and cool, which makes up for the fact that normal attack animations are less interesting).Overall a solid 7.5/10			"
Recommended,8.8,"																i find it very hard to say bad things about this game, even though i have mixed feelings about it.the atmosphere and overall level design is really cool, despite being somewhat confusing at times. the story is great, and even better is the way it's delivered; the whole memory collecting thing is awesome. i usually hate ""protagonists without voice lines"" (not to be confused with purposefully silent protagonists), but code vein weirdly nails it somehow, probably because the voice acting of the other characters hard carries the cut scenes. the character creation is fantastic, and that's saying something for a bandai game, which also helps keep the interactions interesting.gameplay-wise it's... complicated. the blood code mechanic is very unique and creative. the problem is that it's supposed to be a soulslike game. why is that a problem exactly? because it's too easy. i hate having to type that out but it's true. the difficulty really hinders the use of the many unique and fun mechanics it presents. the combat really doesn't do a good job at stimulating the player to explore different builds or even learn the core mechanics at all, which for me is a big problem personally. to me the most fun part of soulslike games is being challenged and forced to learn, something that unfortunately doesn't quite happen in code vein. to give it some credit, it's not like the bosses don't have fun mechanics and learning curves, but somehow nothing seems to really deal much damage or pose a significant threat.in conclusion, it's a good game. you'll have fun playing it, and you'll definitely be engaged in the story. but don't expect the typical soulslike experience as i think most will have a strangely easy time playing, specially for more experienced players.

Recommended,126.7,"																I strongly suggest waiting for a sale to buy it.There is fun to be had in this game! But the combat, specially for the melee focused builds, feels a bit janky.I'd say that the less you play of Code Vein, the more fondly you'll think of your experience with it. So I don't recommend going for a 100% completion play-through, just enjoy exploring the map and the corny anime story.			"
Not Recommended,19.9,"																Quick summary, Anime plot + Souls game-playPlaying through the game and  piecing the lore together was a enjoyable experience.Levels in this game just give stat increases that you cant choose, instead the build variety is by utilizing different blood codes and gifts. A fun system that gives this game its own charm.If you want to 100% this game, do check out how the presents system work and get ready to do the tower of trials(endgame) a fair amount of times. Using the gift that increases item drops speeds up the process and this is really the only ""grinding"" achievment. Using fire/ice weapon and getting in the flow off it makes it go by faster than it at first would seem.			"

Recommended,31.9,"																Code Vein is a good souls-like to start with in fact, and while defintely not easy for one not used to souls-like games (Like me. I don't usually play Souls-likes at all), it's easier to pick up and play.Strategy wise, it really is all about experimentation and finding out how you want to play. Code Vein really is a cut above most games in it's niche because unlike say Dark Souls, you can change and mix and match classes and abilities as much as you want, and the game encourages doing so.Also for a new player it is recommended to play with a AI partner, as they often will comment on things you might miss, and the AI isn't bad at all in fighting along side you. Some say doing so makes the game too easy, but for others it helps a great deal.			"
Recommended,141.1,"																I'll start off by saying that this game is worth no more than $30, although no more than $20 is more realistic. With that being said, Code Vein is not a bad game. It certainly has its flaws, which I'll go over, but it's a solid game with a solid foundation, even if that foundation is just Dark Souls but anime edition.I'll start off with the good. The combat is decent enough and not really clunky, so you at least have enjoyable fights, although the move list is quite scarce, so combat does get very repetitive after a while. But nonetheless, combat is pretty solid in terms of how it's built, just not very innovative and a bit lacking in variation.Even if you don't like anime, like myself, the game is still enjoyable because you can just skip through the cutscenes. Although if you do like anime, there's plenty of cutscenes for you.The game length, not including DLCs or any of the depths, is pretty close to perfect I'd say. I went through with a friend on both of our worlds, so I went through the game twice back to back with each level, but even still, I felt like it was a good length since once you figure out where to go, it's pretty quick top traverse through.Unfortunately that's the extent of the good things I have to say about this game, so I'll touch back to what I last said about figuring out where to go, and that's where one of my biggest problems with this game comes in. Starting off with the worst place in the game: The Castle. Dead end staircases leading to a solid wall, seemingly put there just to make you walk all the way down there just to see if there's an item, which there may or may not be, and if there is an item there, it's probably just a few daggers. This game has an enormous problem with backtrack padding. If I knew exactly where to go right off the bat, and there weren't pointless filler items stuffed in faraway corners, this game's completion time would at least be cut into 1/3. The Castle is the worst place in the game with backtracking and horrendous map design, but it definitely exists in much of the rest of the game.Still speaking of The Castle (I can't remember the exact name of the location, but just think of knockoff Anor Lando), the amount of re-used assets in this game is very frequent, especially in the later game. At the latter-half of the game, you'' find yourself fighting a lot of the same enemies. And re-using assets goes for more than just enemies too. Although it's especially apparent in The Dark Castle. It's literally The Castle but underground and the wall and ceiling patterns (Which are identical) are just a darker shade.The depths, especially the DLC ones, are not good, but the DLC ones are horrendous. But there are plenty of reviews as to why in the review section of the DLC itself.Boss design is also pretty lackluster. You're either fighting a big monster, or you're fighting some busty anime women and/ore creature. And the aggro attention of the copycat Ornstein and Smough boss fight is terrible. Prepare to lose the aggro you just gained 10 seconds after you attacked and continue to attack the enemy.Despite all these negatives, it's a fun $20 adventure with a friend. Don't go in expecting Dark Souls 3 quality for the game overall just because it's Bandai.			"

Recommended,7.5,"																Some might say this game is like Dark Souls but Anime. Well kind of, I never played dark souls my self so i can't really compare the two too much. Code vein's story is great in my opinion it has 3 different ending and 2 of them are great i haven't seen the 3rd one yet. The combat system in this game's quite easy BUT when you get to ng+ ( new game+ ) the enemies pretty much 1 or 2 hit you. So you better be good at parrying or dodging.You also have a compainion that helps you in your fights and can also revive you even tho they seem to sometimes forget to do that.There are also quite a few bosses in the game, some of them are easy and some are quite difficult.I bought the game when it was on discount, it's on discount quite often actually so don't worry about the 50$ just wait for a discount if you don't want to spend that much money.

Allows you to try different gameplay styles.The only annoying thing for me was how clunky the combat sometimes felt. It seemed that animations lacked frames or something like it. Hitboxes and hit register were also sometimes weird.			"

Recommended,60.5,"																The best way to summarize this game, is yes, anime dark souls. However, they do make it a bit more accessible to a wide audience by implementing the ai companion feature. However, if you're looking for a challenge, you can opt out of the companion. Although I would not recommend it until you feel extremely confident. The combat is really in depth, fast paced, and the customization you can on the fly is insane. Yes, the cathedral is annoying, but there are several guides you can look up to get through it. I promise the games pace picks up very quickly after that. The story is decent, especially if you're into anime. The different endings do keep it fresh for each play through and conveniently, you can opt to either enhance or not enhance the difficulty on the new game plus modes. The DLC, while adding a bit more content, is rather disappointing for a souls game. But if you're wanting end game content with extra loot, and some challenging bosses then by all means, purchase the dlc. All in all, if you like souls games, like anime, and like endless build paths, then get this game, you will get a lot out of it.			"

Recommended,61.7,"																amazing game, it's enjoyable enough to stand by itself more than a dark souls clone, and the story is the best part, along with the music. And for the people that are struggling with the cathedral of sacred blood: look down all the time, check for broken environment, complete everything before the boss, and most importantly. Enjoy, because from that boss onward starts the amazing story that this game offers. Super recommended.			"
Recommended,34,"																First up: I like Souls like Games but am really bad or too bad to play them. I bought it already before on PS4 and didn't even get to the first boss - Now I saw the sale and thought to myself, I really like the style and want to know the story, so I looked tipps up for Builds for an ""easy mode"" because srly I'm bad at dodging, Blocking, timing etc. I found a tank build online and started the game, got some times from friends who play the game and love to challenge themselfs even more in such games - Now I'm enjoying this game really much - much more then before.I may die sometimes but I clear maps, have fun doing the bosses, mobs etc and enjoy the good story - I even think about switching or testing other builds and experiment soemthing i would never had thought about before. Even If you're not good in this kind of games, if you find and use a build you're comfortable with - and there are alot of builds you can make and even more the more you progress - then this will be a good and enjoyable exp. Coop Mode is fun too :) To be honest I never thought I play such a game and have fun without frustration and just stay with my ""farm simulation"", JRPGs and slow pace games xD but it's really fun.The Musik, Anime-Style and Story are really good, the combat is now fun too after a bit of research on builds and tips - it's challanging or no depending on your build, practice and if you choose to use NPC Partners or and Co-op friends or do it solo.The only negative thing I can say is, that I would love to have the option to dye blood veils (your Armor) so you could costumazie it to fit your outift/colors.

Recommended,37.8,"																Anime Souls is a soulslike in the worst way possible and anime in the worst way possible.At first glance, it has the appearance of a soulslike but none of the substance. There is no mystery or intrigue. Levels are boring, dull, a chore to navigate and use the same few textures repeatedly. Despite the severe lack of environmental storytelling, cutscenes go on forever. During these obnoxiously melodramatic and long cutscenes with no self-awareness, either nothing is happening or characters explaining the things that are happening right in front of them. Until this game, I have never wanted to stop playing something because of its story. You can unlock new classes and skills by repairing the memories of the NPCs who all have amnesia and sit through more of the awful plot, but new skills and classes are mostly useless anyway. The game also severely lacks enemy variety and original soundtracks.  However, you can adjust your character’s breast size and give her heart shaped pupils.  10/10 BEST GAME 			"
Recommended,26.7,"																Anime Dark Souls as they call it.  And they're not wrong.  Game isn't nearly as difficult compared to Dark Souls, but you'll get your money's worth.  There are some difficult boss fights that even had me raging!Pros:  Good Story TellingAI Partner is overall pretty good and one you can rely on.FANTASTIC soundtrack, esp the boss battles.Overall tight control, but it can be easy to hit the D pad incorrectly and change items when you don't want to.Map tells you where you've recently walked to handy to have (see con below)Lots of weapons and armors leaving you with lots of builds you can play with.Cons:  Bad map design.  The map is very 2D, this is not helpful on some levels such as the Cathderal or the Town of Fire since they have several levels and map over laps it.  No control over the map such as zooming, or moving.Healing and gifts animations are too slow leaving you wide open to attack.Healing could have been a slight more potent (There are items and skills that improves this but would have been nice it was a tad more potent due to the slow animation).Overall:  7.5/10			"

Recommended,50.1,"																Definitivamente si te gusta Dark Souls y el anime tienes que jugarlo.En cuanto historia principal es bastante agradable y entendible a la primera.En gameplay destaca por la gran variedad de estilos de juego para jugar se basa en llevar como un núcleo de estadísticas llamado códigos de sangre y en ellos puedes desbloquear habilidades, una vez desbloqueadas puedes utilizarlas con otros códigos de sangre siempre y cuando cumplan las estadísticas.En armas hay 5 tipos de armas dentro del juego y en cada tipo hay una gran variedad de armas a elegir, los tipos de armas son espadas a una mano, espadas a dos manos, martillo a dos manos, rifles bayonetta y lanzas/alabardas/astas.Donde mas destaca el juego sin ninguna duda es en la personalización de tu personaje, contiene una gran libertad de posibilidades (hay gente en YT que recrea personajes del anime), sin duda alguna es de los juegos tipo anime con mejor personalización de personaje.El diseño de niveles es bastante regular, aquí creo que es uno de los puntos más débiles del juego pero hay algunos niveles que destacan del resto pero la gran mayoría son... malos por no decir terribles y hay 1 nivel que es terrible, si les soy sincero esta parte baja mucho la calidad del juego para mi, pero creo que lo contrarresta con el gameplay que tiene y la variedad de builds por lo que termina siendo un juego regular tirando a bueno.DLC: El juego contiene tres DLC que te desbloquean tres mapas y mediante retos desbloqueas cosméticos, armas y códigos de sangre, los 3 DLC son exactamente iguales en cuanto a contenido cada uno es un mapa donde cada uno tiene un jefe final. Recomendación JUEGO BASE: Cómpralo en oferta definitivamente o en precio regular.Recomendación DLC: Sinceramente solo los compraría si estuvieran a 5 o menos dólares por los 3 DLC mas de 5 dolares ni en broma.PD. Si buscas jugar con algun amigo lamento decirte que el cooperativo es malo y funciona por zonas como en el Dark Souls.			"

Recommended,42.2,"																The Spectacular ""Anime Souls"" I Ever HadIf people are talking about Dark Souls with Anime version, this is what you're looking for. Surprisingly the combat is similiar to Dark Souls and the progression in this game is amazing. But what makes Code Vein different and if I said, ""Unique"" from Souls game? 1. StoryStory is satisfying and with ""Vestiges"", it determines your progression and way to build lore/story that can affect what ending you could get in this game.2. Combat""Blood Code"" is the way to determine your play style in this game. I'm very happy with ""Inherit"" systems, where you can inherit your Blood Code Skill, or ""Gifts"" that can be accessed from different Blood Code. Attack mechanics are unique too where ""Blood Veins"" has different drain attack and parry which may have benefit or fatal influence.3. GameplayI would say this game encourages you to explore more places, as it is will reward you with Blood Veins, Weapons, Items and Vestiges and they done well with the map design. Multiplayer in this game also has benefit and I'm very happy with it, the down side is you can't play with your friends or other player when some of the area already ""Explored"", but it's still acceptable. AI Partner is also a helpful feature to help your progression.4. MusicJust to be short, the instrument and the tone is fantastic.5. Character CreationProbably the best game with character design I ever had, as it's offer you variety option to create character as you want. Can't describe it each one, but trust me when I said you won't regret it.6. Summary""Code Vein offers similarity to Souls game, but with different game mechanics that can offer pleasant play experience and with it, it creates fantastic pleasant play experience."" 10 / 10			"

Recommended,104.9,"																Code Vein is really, really, really, really good. It's a fantastic, well-written story with amazing characters, designs, and settings. It'll hook you within the first few maps, and its challenging yet rewarding gameplay will keep you coming back to see where the story progresses. It was my first soulslike, and I found it the perfect blend of challenging and fun. There's something for everyone here. Please play it. For the love of god. Code Vein sweep.			"
Recommended,110,"																Fun souls-like, love the graphics and feel of the game. Story is pretty good, enough to keep me wanting more. Multiplayer could be better, though, mainly due to not being able to rest at mistles (bonfires) while playing with others. Level scaling requires you to grind a bit early game, which isnt all that bad. I still have yet to play through a lot of it so I cant really say much else.			"

Recommended,28.1,"																It's a decently good game. As you'd expect it's anime dark souls but somehow more janky (Combat Wise) than a traditional souls game. Story is pretty good but bosses can be a bit of a chore especially as of late game. I'd recommend this one to fans who are looking for more souls like games to add to your library. (Side note whoever made that cathedral level. You deserve to be kicked right in the ♥♥♥♥ for that design)			"
Recommended,6,"																Quite a fun soul-like with quite a decent story. I found the combat very satisfying as a dark gift caster. I did get lost a lot and had to back track a lot, but that is normal for me in any game. I would highly recommend the game to anyone, even if you are not that into ""anime"" games. 10/10 will use Io as a companion again :)			"
Recommended,87.1,"																CODE: VEIN a different reality of God Eater. I really don't like Souls like in general, but it's okay. The characters are a bit wooden when it comes to vertical control.When it comes to character creation, I played there for a couple of dozen.I created my character, not only me, my friend also .. On the pros of this game there is also a multiplayer (infinite) unlocked after defeating the first Boss..The biggest problem for almost everyone is the fact that in the character editor we choose the voice,but this character will not say anything in any cut scenes, but this is the norm in such games..Another pleasant surprise is the price, actually I recommend buying this game at a discount, then the game with all DLCs is slightly less than the normal price of the game without those DLCs. The cons for me is the inability to calculate Steam achievements in Offline mode included in the game.			"
Recommended,87.7,"																8/10A great game. - The story is not complicated yet you can find some of it a little surprising.- Personally, this game is hard (I'm not used to this type of game) and requires you to experiment the equipment to find the right one for you (or you can just search recommendation on internet).- Characters are fine as hell, especially Io and Coco. Also, each characters that you interact with (mostly the one you're partnering and NPCs that have relation with your partner) have background stories.- The equipments look are diverse and awesome, it also goes for the stats but some of them can be a real trash so choose based on what you need.- I bought the DELUXE EDITION, but for now I only experienced additional customization on my own character, different version of Mia (partner NPC), and additional depth maps. I will update for more.I recommend you, who types and clicks hard unintentionally, to have spare keyboard and mouse because I broke mine when I completed the main story (exc. side missions). It's a bit lonely because online co-op only playable for max 2 people (including ourselves) and I only have few friends to play with :( SO PLS, LET'S PLAY TOGETHER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED HEHE			"
Recommended,40.4,"																Code Vein tries very hard to be a dark soul clone, hence the tag ""souls-like"". For DS veterans, here my observation:- CV copies mechanics of DS, like stamina bar, weight load, confusing stats, bonfire, estus etc- CV copies frustrating features of DS, like annoying & unfair enemies, tedious side quest, crappy camera etc- CV character creation is far superior than DS. The game comes with a dress up simulator- CV has switchable classes, which allows players to adopt different playstyle in different situations- CV combat is more interesting as compared to DS. Unpopular opinion:- DS is a rolling simulator   - CV map design is far inferior compared to DS. Every map is designed to punish players- CV isn't an open world game. It's more like a dungeon crawler with infuriating mazes- CV story/lore is straightforward. Treat it like an anime, not a dark fantasySpoiler free review:Pro:- Character creation and clothing customization are surprisingly fantastic. Anime haters will yell cringe- Control and mechanics are straightforward. There is a bit of learning curve but nothing overwhelming- A variety of classes, weapon, skills which are switchable throughout the game. Allows room for customization, either for player's preference or adopting certain situations. - Decent English voice acting and script. No cringey anime main character yelling power of friendship.- Graphic are decent, probably better than most try hard games out there - Companion system. People that does not have friends in real life (like me) can finally experience friendship- NG+ promotes replayability. However the difficulty spike is so intense it feels like SL1 or NG+7 runs in DS. Most enemies can and will one shot you. Cons:- Incredibly horrible map design. Everything is: lazy copy and paste; confusing mazes; routes that are easily missed; ledges you can easily fall off; enemy ambushes/invasion etc. People who designed the maps as well as people who enjoys playing should be locked up in the deepest part of an asylum and have the keys thrown away.- Ugly weapon design. Most of them are too long and huge they look unnatural, not proportional and unrealistic to the extend of cringe worthy (even for people that binge watches anime)- Boss fights has significant RNG element and hence luck dependent at times. The final boss is an amalgamation of the worst elements of DS bosses. HP and skill set like Midir, camera like Nameless King, unpredictable like Soul of Cinder. Put them together and speed up the fight by 2x times, make the enemy attack hitboxes 10x wider, halve the enemy charge time and recovery time, and give the attacks insane tracking. There you go, ""souls-like""! - With the exception of a few great soundtrack, 99% of the time there's this low humming, ringing sound on loop. No area specific BGM. Boss fight music isn't epic or memorable either. - Lags, every time when you enter a different area. On rare occasions I have encountered stutter, FPS drop, screen freeze, delays etc. No game breaking bugs or crashes so far. Summary:- By being a DS clone, this game carries over lots of flaws from DS (which toxic fans of DS refuse to admit). There are some areas which CV improves, at the same time some areas CV mess up so bad you want to punch the developers in their face. Worth a try on sales, but do not set your expectation too high. This game is fun and entertaining but please don't expect it to be revolutionary or change your life. I did not bother with the DLC, as the overwhelmingly negative reviews turned me off.			"

Recommended,84,"																I got this game off speculation in which my friend told me to grab it (on the summer sale for an astounding good price of like 12$. and I will say even at 40$ this game is definitively worth its value in re-playability.). i'm over 300 hours in (idk why steam isn't reflecting playtime. I have a male and female character at max level with full completions. This game is a good play the first round, and honestly. I have gone through the story for the 4 different endings. and then began learning skips for speed running. easy to pick up. a lot of customization on your OC. the most AMAZING part of this game, is in fact character creation. i'm sure i've spent 40 hours in Character Creation alone. there are player made mods that take it above and beyond. honestly.... just buy it, enjoy a pretty decent story line. and then hope for Code Vein 2 to be released(people are STILL waiting)EDIT: there seems to be some issues with the game updating achievements (it missed me killing literally the second boss in the entire game 3 runs through. and i'm doing the Heirs ending for the 5th time hoping I get it (UPDATE: I got it). for some reason the blood code achievement doesn't update which locked you out of the Platinum Trophy (Complete every other achievement) so if your a completionist. i suggest making multiple saves each time you get to a new boss and fight them a few times over if the game doesn't update the achievement. though this might be because i play in steam offline mode a lot, and offline mode in game, idk if that effects the updating.)

Recommended,75.8,"																The RPG where you're the companion. Very little of the story revolves around you or your decisions, and in combat your companions can pretty much solo everything while you hide in a corner. If you do try to enter combat, they will often throw so many enemies at you, that you have to play defensively while your companions do all of the work anyway, so even if you wanted to join in the sluggish, unresponsive (missed KBM inputs, and insanely long swings with no dodge cancel) melee combat, and you'll just wind up regretting it. None of the gearing / stat decisions you make seem to matter as they're just minor or incidental bonuses and your companions will do most of the work anyway.Its just a slow slog through very repetitive dungeons and minimal purpose.

"
Recommended,133.3,"																Pretty funky			"
Recommended,24.3,"																Love every thing about this game except one area (Cathedral).			"
Recommended,59.6,"																Honestly this was my first soulslike game, and holy crap was it a great introduction. Anime + Dark Souls + Vampires n' ♥♥♥♥ = Fun as hell. As the game progresses and you become increasingly badass, it becomes really rewarding collecting vestige fragments and opening up more more lore and blood codes. Each code has a fun and unique playstyle, and with the ability to cross-tree abilities, you really can build however you want basically. The combat in this game feels really responsive (Use a controller if you can, I find that much more intuitive to play with)Plan to spend like an hour on character creation because there are a TON of options if you really wanna get detailed with it. Make your badass vampire waifu/husbando and go to town.The learning curve is challenging, but not painfully so, because then the only real kerfuffle comes from new enemy types who grind you into paste until you learn how they behave, bosses included. Maybe you bang your face against it a few times, adjust your build, and boom, dopamine when you clear the room. Although, I will admit, the dual-boss fight near the end of the game (folks who've done it know exactly the pain I'm talking about), messed me up good until I figured it out. I had no friends and I was determined to play by myself and beat it, and after many grueling tries pulled it off.The characters are fun and interesting, and unraveling the lore and mysteries throughout the plot is easy to digest, but has a lot of depth if you're an emotional person like me. The song that plays inside the Vestiges is friggin gorgeous, and it alone has made me cry. The story is fleshed out, and a lot of questions are answered as you play through the different endings.So, if you like anime, and enjoy a bit of a challenge, this is a great intro to soulslike games. (I tried to hop into Elden Ring and found it almost needlessly difficult and sluggish in comparison, (Basically why bother having a health bar if you're just gonna die instantly most of the time. But I'm a filthy casual so xD) If the things I've said above resonate with you, grab the game, you'll enjoy it. Also, there's a demo, so feel free to try that before jumping in if you're not sure.

Recommended,28.3,"																I've never played any game like this before, but I fell in love with it's dorky kitschy plot and characters. It definitely isn't as challenging as souls (The mob AI is much less aggressive), but it was a nice entry to combat with ""souls-bourne"" game. All that being said, I think the current asking price in 2022 for a game they decided to do nothing else with of $80 CAD, is quite steep for a title released in 2019. Definitely wait for this one to go on sale. And I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did!			"
Recommended,39.1,"																I’m just going to list some negatives since everything positive that could be said has already be said.1. iframes do not begin on dodge. Easily the worst thing in this game. I used to believe I was rolling too late since I have bad reaction time, but I noticed I would lose stamina even if I got hit and wasn’t blocking. This is particularly bad in some levels because some enemies attack very fast.2. Movement feels bad to mediocre. This is something you’ll get used to quick, but running feels like skating and I can hardly feel a difference when sprinting.3. You will probably be with an AI companion. The AI is reasonably smart but gets stuck in the terrain sometimes. They occasionally position themselves in such a way that they can block your camera. In combat, it can sometimes get annoying since they’ll use attacks that create flashy effects that make it hard for you to see properly. 80% of the time enemies only aggro you though so you have to focus on tanking while your partner does damage.4. Some of the character designs are skimpy (mostly female). I don’t really mind much, though I would strongly prefer more practical clothes & armour choices and perhaps on all characters (except Yakumo, Mia, and Io, they’re hot lol).5. Stat distribution is determined by preset builds you can swap between at any time. You cannot choose which ability/attribute you want to level up.6. Really weird or just bad bosses. Some examples (Spoilers) a boss whose gimmick is that his animations speed up. he also does a lot of damage. it’s dumb as it sounds.  pole dancer. has a charge attack with little windup and quite a few attacks are just her pole dancing. 7. A lot of the weapon movesets are just bad. You don’t step forward much when attacking, most bayonets have a dumb backstep attack, and most sprinting attacks just make you stop in place instead of doing a well… sprinting attack.			"

Recommended,22.1,"																You can make your character a hot anime girl.Who is This for?But in all seriousness, this game is a great game. It's definitely a good entry point into the souls-like genre with a pseudo easy/easier mode by providing companions. That being said, companions don't make the game all that much easier.How Long is the Game?For a playthrough where you just beat the game, you're looking at around 20 hours of playtime, but unlocking all the different skills and finding all the items would definitely clock more hours.What's Great About the Game?The variety of skills and weapon types allows for a variety of unique builds, which definitely helps with freshening up the game on a new play through. And speaking of playthroughs, definitely finish the game more than once, because the story is filled with so much, that it all can't be explored in one playthrough.			"
Recommended,26.2,"																I'm not going to rant about the minutia of the game because I only played it at a surface level, but I just wanted to leave a review for others who like the Soulslike lore but don't like the frustration of it.After dropping Bloodborne and Nioh due to aggravation with the stress of it, Code Vein caught my eye due to the partner mechanic. Your AI friend will truly be your best buddy as they pick you back up from a random mistake here and there.If you want a more authentic git gud experience, you can go solo, but this was the first game where I felt like I was actually able to enjoy the game instead of sweating over it.If you want to try a souls like and the difficulty is a main deterrent, give this a whirl.

Recommended,54.4,"																Don't go into this game expecting dark souls.  Both have their own feel to their respective games. It has similar mechanics like stamina, exp currency, and passives that you can equip to enhance your playstyle. It however skips the stat allocation and uses blood codes for stat setups you can swap on the fly. Nice for the fact you can swap your playstyle art any time, given you grind out the materials that allow you to inherit skills. Game balance is kind of all over the place. You can play this game with and without an AI partner, which can make fights much easier, though the aggro system is weird at times. I think overall the game was fair, except for a single boss fight where you face two bosses at once. That fight is really up to the individual to decide whether it was a unfair fight or not. You can use 5 catagories of weapons, one-handed and two-handed swords, axes/ hammers, pole-arms and bayonets. You can also learn skills that can buff. cast spells, or enhance your partners. Mana in this game is restored by attacking or consuming items, or using your special drain attack. Story is typical anime flair, our world is now inhabited by vampires called Revenants. Our protag works with other revenants to find a better alternative to human's being used as slaves to feed on by revenants. The main enemy are the Lost, who are revenant that have lost their mind from lack of blood being consumed.I do like the character customizing but the lack of outfits is quite saddening and would have made this game stand out vs other souls-like games in terms of fashion had they only added more. Overall, i can reccomend this game if you like anime games and souls-likes.			"

Recommended,35.2,"																I really loved this game. Probably far more than it objectively deserves but, I found myself enjoying every aspect of this game far more than I ever expected. There are plenty of issues in terms of things like level design, Janky combat and inconsistent difficulty, and lack of enemy variety. However, I still really enjoyed this game despite all of those things. My biggest complaint has to do with the final boss of the true ending that is basically a giant middle finger to anyone who was doing a magic build. The boss is immune to all status effects and 70% resistant to all magic. So, if you were doing a gun/magic build like I was, you basically have to upgrade an entire new set of weapons and armor, as well as learn an entire new set of skills from different blood codes, if you want a chance at beating it.

Recommended,27.5,"																 100% Code Vein Review Anyone who enjoys Dark Souls, or Dark Soul like will greatly enjoy this. Compared to Dark souls this is a much easier game in terms of diffaculty, it also lacks a lot of fighting styles compaired to dark souls, but despite it only having a limited amount of fighitng styles, it makes them all very good and well done. The main game and the story was more enjoyable then I expected, and to get every ending you need to play it 4 times (3 times if you follow a guide). The only hard part for any achievement hunting people out there is grinding the Mark's of Honor for playing in multiplayer. With a friend it will shorten your grind time by a lot, but it still possible to get solo, just expect to grind the final tower for marks, as your only way of obtaining them outside of online help.Overall very enjoyable and anyone who enjoys dark souls play and fighting style, but dont want it as punishing will enjoy this, or those who want a break from the punishing gameplay may find enjoyment also.			"
Recommended,19.1,"																A great game where you basically play Dark Souls in an Anime setting, there some flaws here and there but overall, I adore the concept of this game and its mechanics, it's absolutely worth the time and money I invested into this playing it. Would highly recommend for those who just got into Soulslike games similar to Remnant, Hollow Knight, and the like.			"
Recommended,43.3,"																(Potential minor spoilers btw) Honestly, I enjoyed this when I played it, For the first full playthrough of this game, I decided to go for the immediate True Good ending of the game where you collect all of the vestiges related to the attendants, and where you saved all successors you came across. Eventually I'll do the other two on other characters tho for the other endings. Simply to see them and what happens.I do recommend this game however to those who are okay with the anime factor of this game, and to those who also like dark souls style gameplay. Also I'd suggest modding only if you know what your doing, and if you either don't care to play vanilla thru campaign the first time, or if you decide to only do it after playing campaign at least once.Also just a shame that for someone like me, Finding people who also have the game and are willing to play, is problematic, so I'd suggest not playing online unless you really wanna try. (and definitely no to online if you mod the game, just incase if the game has anything that prevents people from using mods in multiplayer.)			"

Recommended,75.2,"																The game is a Souls-like with decent mechanical depth, variety of builds, replayability combined with a JRPG inspired storyline and much more focus on storytelling and cinematics as compared to most other souls-like titles. Graphics are a bit dated when it comes to textures but the aesthetics are good enough overall and get the job done. Gameplay has a few bugs especially during online co-op gameplay but nothing game-breaking.Overall, worth a playthrough or two if you like this genre of game.			"
Recommended,223.6,"																This is a mediocre souls-like with decent but weightless combat, poor visual design, and poor boss design, but most notably exceptionally bad level design. Genuinely the cathedral is the worst area I've ever experienced; I'm not exaggerating when I say it would take nearly half an hour to run through if you already knew the route and there were no enemies and multiple hours on your first playthrough (the scale of it is beyond absurd), and combined with absolutely atrocious architecture and repetitive visuals it's a mind-numbing slog to get through. Well-constructed areas are one of the most important aspects of the souls games, and this one is so far off from that standard that its best areas couldn't even be compared to the worst levels in the Soulsborne line. It's also extremely easy, with little challenge at any point except for unfair gank bosses that don't move at different speeds and are therefore impossible to separate unless you use a partner. Virtually every boss is either a total pushover or an annoying multi-enemy fight, and not a single one of them is memorable. Most enemies have extremely low poise and getting one hit with a heavy weapon ends 95% of 1v1 encounters with an infinite stunlock, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility to clear an area entirely your first time through without even taking a single hit. The difficulty also means you don't have to engage with any of the game's systems; you could never use a single gift, never transform a weapon, never exchange valuables, never use your blood veil, and you'd still cruise through the game. Some of these are actually good ideas that never become meaningful because the game is too easy.Back to the visual design for a moment, the animations and background scenery are underwhelming at the best of times, and stretch all the way to downright awful. Combat animations for some weapons aren't terrible, but they completely lack weight and feel robotic. As a whole bosses are animated very poorly, with telegraphs being difficult to distinguish and with very unintuitive movesets on even the best bosses. Like I already mentioned, the Cathedral is a hideous level, but it doesn't get a ton better than that at any point. The scenery is boring and largely incoherent, none of these places feel like a real world. There are no pretty areas at all: the setting is as generic of a post-apocalypse as you've ever seen, and it's all a drab greyish-brown. I had to take multiple breaks per session to avoid eye strain.I don't really have much else to say; if it goes on sale for $10 or less I could possibly recommend it with a caveat: just quit playing once you see ""Cathedral of the Sacred Blood"" appear on your screen and you'll get a good 7-8 hours of gameplay out of it if you're a souls veteran. This is a terrible way to spend $60 on steam; if you still really want to get it after reading this far into a scathing review, buy an activation code from a third party if you can't wait for a sale.

Recommended,50.1,"																Code Vein by far has one of the best character customization i have ever seen in Gaming. They outdid themselves with the Customization to the point you can make your characters look Anime like and Unique in their own Experience. The gameplay being very similar to the Souls Series making it that you will require skill to complete the game and continue forward. The game allows your avatar to be the one with he ""Null"" bloodtype which makes you different from everyone else in the game and allows you later on to see the memories of all revenants that have left memories shards of themselves. If you want a game with a deep story and good gameplay this is the game for you.			"
Recommended,38,"																I love Dark Souls, I really do, however there's just one thing preventing it from being the best game of all time. It lacks hot springs.After killing a boss, it's scientifically proven that relaxing in hot water surrounded by very attractive people can help with mental health and to relieve stress. Code Vein is an anime game, and it has hot springs. More importantly, Archer from Fate/Stay Night can visit the hot springs.WOW.Very nice character creator, saves looking like a corpse bride MF all the time, even if it's somewhat lacking in the equipment department.

Recommended,42.1,"																Code Vein is a solid game and a good souls-like. I found myself enjoying it quite a bit and took the time to even 100% the game’s achievements. As a Dark Souls purist (and let’s be real cultist) I do see issues with this game, but overall they are minor enough that I did not feel they tainted the experience.So the story was my least favorite part. I found the melodramatic anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to not be my thing, this is especially disappointing because I would say that a major portion of this game is the story. I think if you are a huge fan of anime and the tropes it has you will enjoy this story. As for me, I found it annoying. What was THE WORST was all of the memory interactive cut scenes there is an incredible amount of them and they play the same music (almost) every time. What is kind of contradictory to that is that I did enjoy the characters, yeah their stories and backgrounds were not my favorites but I found them all interesting and liked their personalities quite a bit. Overall it is serviceable, but was not my cup of tea.The gameplay on the other hand is a completely different story. I am a sucker for the souls-like gameplay and this game has a different enough twist that it created a unique experience. First the bad, the leveling does not feel good because you just straight level you don’t get to choose your stats so building your character is less intuitive and fun, the max level is 300 which is disappointing and I reached that limit in a surprisingly reasonable time (55 hours or so) In Dark Souls 3, for example, I am 323 and I have roughly 160 hours, there is limited equipment and very few slots, enemies needed more variety, the maps needed more variety/soul and lacked the interconnectedness and smart map design of the Dark Souls series (like seriously there are paths and elevators that are clearly for loading areas and you can never see another area from another and they do not fit together well), and the Cathedral of Sacred Blood is the most confusing and terrible looking area I have ever seen in a souls-like perhaps any game. On the good side, the Ability system is a clear highlight, I believe they skimped heavily on gear and instead put a ton of skills in, and honestly, they were a blast to play with. I trained pretty much every one of the base game blood codes/abilities and got to try a lot of stuff I think there is a lot of build potential and fun to be had here. Speaking of the blood codes they determine your stats and what abilities you can use, they are fine but I would have liked the stat-based leveling instead. Combat is fast and smooth but there is a lot of potential for being stun-locked which could have been solved by having a system like poise in Dark Souls. Combat generally feels fair and punishes you when you mess up, but some of the bosses have some unfair abilities and it will induce rage. Speaking of bosses they feel distinct from Dark Souls and were pretty fun to fight, but they do feel spongy. You also have constant companions in this game and they are generally helpful dealing solid damage, drawing aggro, and reviving you (though I found that to be a bit spotty at times); but they constantly notify you of stuff, so make sure to turn that off it will bother you, but they will occasionally point out important things, which is nice. What was perhaps the best part of the gameplay was playing with my friend it is extremely intuitive to connect to your friend and was obviously a focus in the game design and it feels like the bosses were designed around having you, your companion, and a friend. It was a shame that they gave up midway through, yeah this game has its problems but it was fun to laugh at the story and I always enjoy boss fighting with them. Shame that I am willing to play ♥♥♥♥ I don’t care for just to spend time with them, but they are resistant to doing the same for me. The controls were fine. They are mapped very different from Dark Souls, but it works and just took some practice.Graphically this game is very good, there is a lack of variety in some mapping elements, but that is minor. The characters have that signature anime style and I found that very appealing. Although this could be noted in gameplay the character creator is this game is my favorite one I have used to date. There is just so much to do, my character looked great, and because the armor is minimalistic I got to see them all the time and that gave me a positive outlook on the graphics of this game because with a character creator it is not uncommon for your character to look weird and this game nailed it which was great. The animations were overall very good. I would say this game looks good and the stylization will keep it looking good for years.Without a doubt the best part of this game is the music, they went so hard and they did not have to. The only bad song is the one they play with every memory and that is better attributed to how often it is repeated in the game. I promise you when you are sitting in the start menu adjusting the graphics you will know what I mean.Glitches were minimal the only one I can directly recall is that in Crypt Spire I had to ALT-TAB in and out to get the elevators to work.Overall this is a good game. I do think the 87% positive (at the time of review) is a little too high, but I am glad many others enjoyed this game like me. I would like to note that you need to get this game on sale, I got 66 hours in this game, but pre-ordered the deluxe edition back in the day because I liked the concept and knew as a souls-like I would get a lot of playtime out of it. Generally, I try to get an hour of gameplay for every dollar I spend, and I did not meet that here, and I got 100% of the achievements, most of you won’t do that. One normal play through which is what most of you can do can be done in as little as 15-20 hours depending on how invested you are in the story and how good you are at souls-likes. Online it says 30-40 hours, but that seems leisurely to me, but perhaps I have just played too many souls-likes at this point. Hell, when I was achievement hunting I beat one run by rushing the bosses in less than 2 hours it was pretty crazy. Pick up this game and give it a play I think you will have fun with it.			"

I just finished the main story, played all the depths maps which are some lite equivalent of the Chalices in Bloodborne (except one i guess) and even beat the first of the 3 DLC's called Hellfire Knight ( i was/am level 159 and it was still F'ing hard).Apart from the difficulty of the DLC the rest of the game was not really as hard as i expected it to be based on what i read about this game, but very pleasant and fun to play anyway. Pretty similar to Nioh when it comes to enemy placement/ambushes. Story is meh, a bit too much talking and drama for me but i was interested in going until the end anyway. Seems there's multiple endings too.Character customization is good even if anime is not really my thing...fun to play around and you can change appearance anytime you want to from the hub.Combat and skills feel good, very good. The strong side of Code Vein. A lot of possibilities and builds to play with. And you can change them on the fly.I got one that was really strong (Dex and Dark gifts) and it carried me through the whole playthrough with ease. I even killed the 4 last bosses on my first tries ! I'll try the NG+ and see how it goes, gonna try completely solo this time (spent a big part of my first playthrough with Io as she asks to come with at some point)Really enjoyed this game and looking forward to play some more soon			"

Recommended,31.7,"																8.5/10This is a souls like JRPG.To compare it with games I've played in the past, it's like Xenoblade but with battles resembling DARK SOULS 3.The difficulty is much easier than the Souls series, as you have an AI partner all the time helping you. My most retires was about 7 times, definitely less than 10. The class system is nothing like DARK SOULS tho, and should be looked at like a JRPG. Once you get the hang of it, it's actually very interesting with a variety of styles you can use to fight and many skills to master.Story seems a bit short. The base game excluding DLC only took me about 30 hours, and I went to every part of the maps to find items. Haven't played the DLC yet, but I had fun so despite the mixed reviews I plan on buying them.			"

And think it's easier than Dark Souls since you can always have a follower helping you (if you want), but it's not a walk in the park either. Or I'm just to used to this kind of game...The story, character creation and weapons and armors designs are rly cool.Actually a special shout out for the character creation, you can see several videos of people recreating famous anime characters without mods because of how freely you can set the accessories. Also you can change your character appearance later any time you want. Which is a great Quality Of Life feature in my opinion.Soundtrack reminds me a little of nier and kimetsu no yaiba.(I never played nier so bear with me here)This game is not a AAA polished experience but it's rly entertaining (event though most AAA are not polished nowadays anyway). During minor quests the characters talk without moving the lips, armor clips with the hair a lot, some physics are not thaat good etc.. minor details but overall a good experience.I'm not diminishing the game just telling you what to expect. It works really well with mouse+keyboard, although since I can I use a controller.I must say this game is a rly rly good anime game, specially since most anime games looks like ps2 hd edition.I just wished that the main character could talk during the dialogs since I think it's pretty dumb when everyone is talk and we are just looking and nodding. It's not this game fault, but a thing game devs use to make you dive better into your character or something. Which I hate, but it is personal preference.(cause its dumb)			"

The areas as in game design are kinda boring but i did like that cathedral of blood area but it looked so bland. Apart from that nothing stuck out to me apart from wanna be blightown. Game play completely rips off dark souls apart from the ichor magic ♥♥♥♥ and the minor changes. Most enemies are reskins or reused with more health making for little variety. The game is worth playing excluding the DLC. Also the writing, story and dialogue is so awful. Just anime motivation speeches, boring/annoying characters. The partners never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. I will kill Louis. Story is built on the sort of okay world but not much is extremely interesting to be honest. The mid game bosses are probably this games strongest element, a lot of their attacks are a bit ♥♥♥♥ and the fact that half of them are just tall women with big boobs kind of puts me off any element that they are interesting boss designs. But some of the fights can be pretty fun. I would put an example but none of them are particularly memorable let a lone the facts that their names are just bad so I don't really remember any of their names. So yeah game is worth it just don't play DLC and skip the cutscenes unless you want some understanding of the story, just keep in mind your gonna hear the most annoying characters ever.			"

And they should have an option to allow the host/player to rejoin the same game after the boss fight ends.			"
Recommended,8.7,"																This game fails in so many ways to live up to the name ""anime souls"". It's more like Nier mixed with some souls ideas. I don't mean this in a good way. The combat is a joke and none of the bosses have a part 2 or part 3 like in the souls games. If the boss did have a ""second"" component, it was saved as a checkpoint so that I never had to work to get there. The side characters never shut up, which would be a nice touch to add in updates. Overall 3/10			"
Not Recommended,7.1,"																If you like Final Fantasy and Dark Souls and Anime this is the game for you. It's pleasantly challenging and really fun to play. The character customization is top tier. The story is intriguing. All in all, a great game. My only complaint is the overly sexualized female enemies but, that's easily overlooked when stacked against all the other qualities of the game. 11/10 would recommend.			"
Recommended,2.1,"																This game is an exercise in empathy. Each character you meet (and some you don't meet) is fleshed out in a way so that you truly understand their motivations for living in this world. Some as simple as protecting someone or trying to survive, to trying to ease the suffering of others by taking that suffering upon yourself.Frankly, I love all the characters. From their looks, which I find to be elegant and stylish, to their voice acting, to their motivations, to their gameplay, to their individual storylines and character arcs. Some of their specific moments even made me tear up, something that I was not expecting from a game people dismissively call ""Dark Souls but anime"".This game is not without it's faults however. I would've liked to see more enemy diversity, perhaps better level design in some cases, and simply more moments with the characters, be they playful or somber. Also, discount Anor Londo is not the best...That being said, it's an interesting premise and I'm looking forward to a more refined, bigger budget sequel to this game that can expand on it's best features and trim the fat from it's worst.Overall, an 8/10.

Recommended,18.6,"																Multiplayer is pretty dead, shortening the overall life of the game. It has a slow start which is pretty painful to sit through but once you get enough blood codes (classes) and skills the game really opens up. The story also picks up half way through and by the end i actually bonded with my companions which is nice. Also i have to mention the music. Big fan. 8/10			"

Recommended,62.2,"																What You Should Know Before Buying: Positives and NegativesPros:+Generous number of checkpoints (which you can teleport to and heal you all the way)+Wide variety of weapons and skills+In-game currency to level up, upgrade weapons/armor, and learn skills is fairly easy to come by, making farming not really necessary+Excellent character creation program; I decided the anime character I wanted to play as before glancing at the generator to know if it was possible, and yet I was able to create an avatar that looks just like her+Few loading screens+Multiplayer hardly ever had streaming issues; just some lag during a boss fight with two enemies at once+OP by Ufotable with a song that sounds like it came straight out of Metal Gear Rising, amazingCons:-If you want to play this game co-op, you need to do every level twice. Once on one file, once on the other-Little variety for the music. The OP and ED songs are great, but for 70% of the game you'll hear nothing, 20% the same irritating battle music, and 10% the same boss music-Some levels have needlessly irritating gimmicks, like sand that drains MP. Other levels are straight up mazes with few to no landmarks to make areas feel distinct-The last three levels or so reuse the same enemies over and over again-Since the whole game takes place in the same city, many levels appear samey, especially towards the end-Characters are uncompelling; feel like the same sort of stereotypes you see in every post-apocalyptic setting (but I'm biased since I'm generally not a fan of the genre)-Side story cut scenes (of which you have to watch to learn skills) progress by making you walk past stone statues through grayed out environments at the slowest in-game speed possible while you listen to people talk. It's dull, cheap, and tedious. Fortunately, you can skip them, but watching cut scenes shouldn't be such a pain that you'd want to skip them			"

Recommended,182.6,"																Great introduction to a souls like game,  you are greeted with big anime titties 1 minute after character creation. If you are a veteran at souls game i recommend playing it without a companion. Sometimes the movement in this game feels like it has no weight in it, the graphic is fine but its definitely over saturated, The game focus more on the story than in any other souls game, the characters here is your stereotypical anime gang, the boss fight is pretty easy if you are with a companion, it gets very hard if you are playing solo ( im lookin at you blade bearer and canoneer).

Recommended,131.8,"																My wife used to like watching me play games. She hated playing them herself (she claimed they made her nervous), but she loved getting absorbed by the plot of whatever game I happened to be playing. I noticed a change in her after I started playing Code Vein. It started slowly but it was undeniably there, like a growth developing just under her skin. We both knew it but neither acknowledged it. We stopped becoming intimate and began to grow distant. It wasn't until a few days after I had first booted this game that the source of this change was revealed. We were sitting on the couch when my wife gently placed her hand on my shoulder. The look on her face... it was a look I will never forget. It was then that she revealed that Io's generous assets and scantily clad attire finally allowed her to embrace that she was a  homosexual. I understood and was so proud of her immense courage.We are now divorced and I have lost custody of my children.Highly recommend.			"

Recommended,47.7,"																I'm super glad that when I got bored with Nier: Automata and Animal Crossing: New Horizon, I picked up this game.I absolutely love the character customization here, it's so innovative and fresh to me (awesome hair options and accessories).Graphics are very consistent and pretty between zones and during cutscenes.Music and audio are fine, not super impressive to me but they do fit the environment.I've played with both English voices and Japanese voices, and I think both of them are great.I personally didn't play with photo mode a lot but I'm sure there are a lot of things you can do with it (lots of filters and poses).I'm obsessed with it for the past few days and would definitely recommend grabbing it when it's on sale!			"
Recommended,7.4,"																Ultimately, this game was fine, but the story was just terrible in my eyes.  Much of the narrative is told via these flashback scenes with the same background track, and still models with voice acing overlaid.  It'd be neat if used once or twice, but the game heavily relies on it and ultimately I lost interest in the story outside of its most basic aspects.  The gameplay is the only reason I continued until I beat the game.  I've never been able to get into a Souls-like game, but this is the first one I actually liked.  Perhaps it was because the game felt more forgiving and easier than the ones I tried, but the gameplay was actually kind of fun.  There are a lot of classes and abilities you can earn over time and equip (I didn't really bother with that and stuck with 2-3 classes over the course of the game), so I'd imagine if you like building character kits like that, you might enjoy it even more.Some of the level designs were frustrating, too.  There's a handful of levels that prolong playtime by needlessly making them into weird labyrinths with long stretches of nothing but walking.  There was one or two gimmick levels too that I wasn't a huge fan of, but they didn't bother me as much as the maze-like levels.  They were themed well though, I will say.  The character creator was pretty neat, though!  I was able to make my favorite vtuber in it, which  was neat.  It's strangely limited in some places like outfits and hairstyles, but makes up for it with its accessory and eye customizations.  The character creator is good, but it has some flaws that keep it from being one of the better ones out there.Overall, this a very middling game.  If you like edgy anime fantasy stories, you may end up liking the story after all.  If you like solving mazes, the level design may not bother you.  I don't think the game itself is bad!  There is a lot of stuff to like here, but I think ultimately, this game was not made with my tastes in mind, which is why I hate the story especially.  But I am glad I got to play this overall, even if I didn't love it.			"
Recommended,35.9,"																The game at its core is a Dark Souls like game. Fight challenging enemies, upgrade weapons and unravel the lore behind the games. The game contains different  classes in which the player can choose. From these classes, Skills, called gifts can be unlocked which can aid to turn the tide of battle through offensive attacks or buffs. Through these gifts and classes, the player can come up with different combinations and builds to fit their playstyle be it an offensive melee fighter or a caster.The graphics and animation style veer towards the anime side, with many different customisations and looks to choose from. What i personally liked best were the parry and riposte animations which looked pretty cool.The Game can be played alongside an AI controlled partner which are fairly competent. The first playthrough is not too challenging and will provide an enjoyable experience to uncover the story. For those who seek a challenge, you will have to finish the game once first to unlock the new game+ enhance version. In this mode, the game is significantly tougher and will require quick reflexes with enemies chunking down huge portions of the health bar in a single hit.			"
Not Recommended,16.2,"																It'll take some getting used to at first, especially with sudden spikes in difficulty (take the first actual boss for example.. still got PTSD from that), but overall its still great funThe character creator is also downright insane with the amount of customization options, which at times can also include up to 3 different colour choices, as well as the size and positioning of the added item.The DLCs may have mostly negative comments, but honestly if you can get the Deluxe edition on a discount its definitely worth it. It provides some good replayability and decent challenges in the new 3 dungeons it adds (along with additional customization for yourself and even your companions)Not as difficult as Dark Souls, but also far from being a walk in the park.

Recommended,32.3,"																Soulslike maintained in the anime convention with more advanced fighting mechanics than in the DS series and a very good storyline, just so briefly you can describe Code Vein. Moving on to the pros of this game.+  The soundtrack of this game is on a divine level. From the very entrance to the game menu you can feel the tingling in your back, and then it's even better. The Soundtrack is great although sometimes repetitive.+  The character creator is brilliant, you can practically create any character you want.+  The optimization of this game is at a very high level, I did not experience too much of any animation cuts and as soon as they appear it is only when loading the terrain or when using the elevator.+ The way the story is told, with each passing moment we want to know how it will go on.+  NPC each npc has its own different character and charisma, the deeper with the plot the more we learn the stories of a particular character.+ the mechanics of combat is very extensive, we have to choose a wide range of weapons, from ordinary swords to rifles. Very interesting are also blood veil depending on the dressed blood veil that is just armor we have a unique special attack, this also applies to weapons. As for skills, there are plenty of them, each class has its own unique attacks.+ + Bosses in this game are difficult.- Unfortunately I was disappointed on Dlcs for this game they add relatively little to the plot and the content itself, and they cost quite a lot.- No PvP, you can supposedly download a mod that allows PvP mode but I think that this mode should already be in the game from the beginning.So if you're looking for a Soulslike game, I don't think there's a better title right now. I highly recommend to check this title because it is worth it			"

If u have already played DS3, it makes you feel it at the moment you step in the swamp map. The swamp map and the monsters so much like Farron Keep in DS3.

Recommended,18.4,"																One day the Dark Souls devs were helping the God Eaters devs rearrange some office furniture, and one of the guys slipped on a banana peel and spilled a whole bucket of Fenrir waifus all over some Souls vampire zombie maps. A big bucket too. Not just one of those gallon buckets with a handle on it, an industrial size garbage can bucket of extra waifus. It would have taken years to clean all the waifus up, so they were just like ""What if we just take these maps and make the Waifuest Waifu Souls that ever Souls-liked? I mean, all those Waifus were just sitting around 'cause we couldn't fit them in to the little God Eater maps, so..."" and CodeWaifu was born.			"

Recommended,15,"																From what I’ve gathered so far from the game, the cons outweigh the pros by a long shot. The game seemed to look decent, but my expectations for the game were pretty low when seeing the trailer and gameplay before it was finally released. Despite this, I was able to play the game immediately, and I did enjoy it in the beginning. After getting halfway through the game, I just stopped. The game wasn’t captivating enough to keep me playing for hours on end, the game felt repetitive and with many parts of the game to be lacking added to my already low expectations. (If you haven’t played this game, there are no spoilers to the story, but I will review areas, enemies and bosses.) Here is my full in depth review: Maps / AreasThere is one key word to describe 99% of the areas: Linear. The game basically handholds you the whole time, there is no real exploration, with the exceptions of some areas. The best example of linear gameplay is the area: City of Falling Flame. You would expect this area to be a big open world, yet it’s by far the most annoying and boring area to be in. Instead of being able to explore this desolate city and being able to go into ruined buildings and towers, you instead wander the street, being confined by flames that specifically blocks you from entering those buildings. The game has no room for exploration, even when it shows a different path it ends up leading to a dead end with maybe an item. Every area just feels the same, you go from Point A to Point B to Point C and then you reach the boss. These areas feel even more boring with the same types of enemies and mediocre combat.The PvE ExperienceSince there is no PvP, the PvE experience almost has to be perfect in order for this game to feel refreshing, especially when you have 14 different areas. After introducing the archetype of enemies and some events, nothing really changes. It just gets “harder” as you level up, just more enemy health and damage.Enemies and AISadly, there isn’t much from the usual. You have the fodder enemies, ones that are pretty weak, hold the normal sword or bayonet. Then you have larger enemies, usually holding greatswords or great hammers. Some enemies are a little more unique since they aren’t humanoid, so they use some type of unique attack. With that in mind, every area you go to has this layout. The attacks “can” vary, but they end up reusing the same enemies for most areas, with maybe changes in color. It’s extremely lazy and boring.Weapon VarietyThe only unique thing was  the bayonet. Sadly, this new weapon is so boring, but it’s at least somewhat unique with gifts (abilities that you can unlock). Other than that, all weapons have the same moves within their archetype of Dex or Strength. Weapons look the same, have slightly different stats, and maybe with some different name, but it all just falls flat.BossesMy biggest problem is the bosses. One thing that is very important is to deliver some huge and important enemy at the end of the level. It’s the world building, and to make them look grand and threatening. Sadly, this game just has a bunch of most Humanoid-Beasts for bosses, where they have unique moves, but they always end up pretty easy to beat. The other big problem is balancing bosses. Bosses shouldn’t just do absurd damage just because, especially with some moves almost being non react-able, but you can make it so that even bosses have high risk high reward moves. The bosses don’t feel challenged when they just do a lot of damage, it just comes off as fake difficulty, it just feels shallow.Story / LoreAlong with bosses, the Story/Lore is really boring. Well, not to say that it’s bad, it’s just very bland, especially the way that they put it into a pretty boring mode where you go on your own to discover the character's pasts. It’s a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PvE story driven game, why is it not incorporated more? Along with that, bosses just have no hype to them. No stories, they just feel like enemies you just fight. None of them are memorable and it’s honestly sad because the story doesn’t do it justice. To cap it all off, one of the most important things about making a game is to leave the fan-base to theory-craft the outcome of the story. Sometimes it’s better to leave loose ends in the story and to not just spoon feed all the information. It’s what makes the game live longer, and feels refreshing to discover new things about the story.All in all, the game just feels repetitive. Everything feels flat, linear, and boring.			"
Recommended,30.9,"																okay 3.9 hours into the game and all i can say is wowthe games story is a little bit more original then most games that take inspiration from the dark souls franchiseand when i say inspiration i mean they cloned the whole crystal save and level up and if you die you get ""souls"" taken from you which you need to collect or you lose them all.but the items are cool,the different combat styles are great so far and the weapons just tickle that little kidin you wishing to live like a bad ass in the apocalypse.now ill recommend this game to anyone who enjoys dark souls and anime with a fully voiced Eng dub voice cast which surprisingly tasteful and well executed and most importantly doesn't suck...lets be honest most of the Eng dubs game company's have done for rogue like RPGs have been really really bad.any way enough ranting rating timeArt style  8/10Combat   7/10   lots of extras but still feels like im playing dark souls/but to be fair, a lot easier if you have a AI partner with you so...for you hardcore darksoulers  play solo if you want the challenge.character development  8/10story line     8/10Music and sound 10/10   im must say some really really masterful tracks			"
Recommended,53.9,"																A lot of people consider this game to be Anime Souls, which is only really half a truth. The game takes homage from Dark Souls in a way it does its combat and progression both in the game world and your character but that's where the comparison can end, it plays more like a JRPG with an emphasis on the story which you can find out through the cut scenes, dialogue and memory sequences. The game is """"easier"""" than a DS game as its made to be more accessible to the Code Vein/God Eater universe, with a companion who can follow you to provide support through combat or revives during battles. There is a wide variety of magic and combat skills you can use throughout the game as well as different weapon and armour combinations to make plenty of different builds with.If you go into this game expecting a brutal Dark Souls clone, you might be put off. If you go into it wanting a story based JRPG game with soulslike combat, you will like it. The game features some anime tropes, which can put some people off but its not enough to write the whole game off. The story in itself is interesting and there is some more hidden lore to find out about the world.			"
Recommended,39.3,"																I dunno, Anime Souls-Like? As advertised? ""Decent"" would be my word for it.CONS:-I didn't find the overall story all that compelling.-The ending that I got felt very Makoto Yuki in ""The Answer"", if you know what I'm talking about. I know there are other endings but I wouldn't consider that a reason for me to revisit this game.-HURRHURR BIG BOOBIE LADIES. Or a Pro if you're into that.PROS:-Decent playtime.-PLENTY of side-story to experience. -Coming up with your build was neat pretty open ended, it would likely be one reason I'd consider revisiting the game in the future.			"
Not Recommended,10.4,"																The game is very good and extensive in terms of content. If I had to mention what I liked:First: In Lore of the world, you don't have to go online or like in other souls-like games by reading literally everything. From the description of items to the history of individual heroes (which I also recommend if you want to make up for something in the story)The second is an extensive character creator. This is simply great, although I miss typical school outfits or customizing my own outfit, not from ready-made patterns where you can subtract or add individual elements from the outfit.The third is history. Two words: too addictive. Personally, the story drew me for hours and gave me new light to the world after the apocalypse.The last one is graphics. An anime line and bright colors in most of the locations, and dark in the main places and the old ... that's just heavenly aesthetically.In conclusion, I recommend the game for virtually all its elements.

Recommended,68.1,"																Feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Monster hunter. Controls are fine, but combat is god awful, rolls provide inconsistent invincibility frames, attack hitboxes sometimes dont connect even when they clearly do, or enemy hitboxes DO connect when they really shouldnt have.(If you ever fought Plesioth from MH, you know exactly what im talking bout.) It is insanely sluggish. I am a hammer main in monster hunter, so I know slowish fighting; but holy cow this is so much worse. Even the when I minimized weight to improve speed, even the damn 1 handed sword feels so ehhhh. Enemies are not particularly interesting either. The majority of combat puts you next to the ledge so expect to get cheap shotted alot to death. Bosses arent much better.  Bosses amount to more or less beating up thematic half naked waifus, with an occasional animal.The issues go doubley so for maps, which are predominantly one color (think ALL white or all black, all brown) to mask random holes thrown around for more insta kills. (off topic, who the hell puts something that big next to a damn parking garage?) Speaking of, the maps basically amount to large hallways in a giant maze.The story is kinda interesting? But its so hard to ignore some of the more stupid obvious fails. Like the main characters couldnt find a way to a specific plot element, searched everywhere, didnt see the ladder apparently? I guess thats foreshadowing for the gameplay itself. Its a shame, the game looks amazing, and I really wanted to like this game; but its just not a good game. About 10 hours in, after killing 100+ gender bent skeletors I finally asked myself why I was still playing this crap, and turned it off. I dont recommend=/ At least the girls are cute?			"
Recommended,30.4,"																It's not on the level of a Souls Game. It's a comfy weeb-ass Souls Clone with no real difficulty, aside from maybe dismissing your companion. You can break the game easily with overpowered builds and that is kind of fun. The story is hot garbage. Just skip it, and you get 20 hours of light-hearted fun out of it.			"

Although it was kinda hard at the beginning, but once you get used to it, seems pretty easy tho. a great anime game with attractive character customization, fresh and challenging enemies and bosses, plenty of bloodcode and gifts (which is really good to build your own game style), and it has a really great story. All of those vestiges things that lead us to the lore of every character in this game was reallyyy interesting. i suggest u guys to buy the deluxe edition and the DLCs for more content.			"

Recommended,136.8,"																 As a souls-like fan i enjoyed playing through this game a lot.Played without a companion and would recommend doing so as this game is incredibly easy otherwise.7.5/10 - Its great, but not perfect.Slight gameplay spoilers of things i think could've been done better:Lost invasions in the current state are stupid, in some areas you can trigger special just by passing by event that spawns ~ 20 mobs in the packs of 3 to kill you. This is incredibly difficult to clear solo and a joke with a companion. After defeating this you get a very little reward that is not worth it at all.There is a mini-boss in the certain area that is basically a two tanky enemies with lots of health, extremely fast and unpredictable moveset that deals half of your hp bar per hit. Its near impossible to do solo at the expected character lvl and a joke with a companion.No pause - game doesn't have pvp, only coop so i dont see why i cant pause the game in offline modeNo auto saving every couple of seconds like in dark souls - game saves only at ""mistles"" (checkpoints) meaning if you need to quit the game in the middle of exploring new area you have to go back to the mistle to save (or teleport) but in this case enemies will respawn.Bugs - they are extremely rare, but impactful. As an example there is a boss that sometimes becomes full invisible (or only the body, so weapons are still there)for most of the fight making it really hard to beat (its definitely a bug that appeared a bit after release date, watched a couple of day 1 walkthroughs, no one had this issue)Also there is an shortcut elevator that takes like 30 second to start moving, while every single other elevator starts going immediately.

Recommended,90.2,"																Too many reviews don't go into detail about the game's mechanics but it's fun despite the ridiculous learning curb.The character creator is great but there are way too few slots for accessories given how many there are which makes it impossible to create detailed looks. 1 earring takes 1 of the 7 slots you get and highlighting a single part of your hair also takes 1 slot and 1 single glove or bag takes 1 slot like seriously wtf. Combine that with not being able to mix and match clothing pieces from outfits and it's actually more limited then it looks and no being able to remove pieces of clothing doesn't count. It just cheap fanservice. There are a lot of accessories though for many different styles out there.The gameplay is a mixed bag. It's impossible to have a medium roll and be able to tank hits due to how heavy most of the weapons are and the fact that a medium roll requires you to be under 50% and a fast roll requires you to be under 25%. This is the case for most of the blood codes (the game's class system). The blood codes have a weight capacity and a default speed. All of the higher weight classes have a default speed of slow which means you don't need to be under 50% for a medium roll but you will never have a fast roll with large weapons. It's like the developers wanted to prevent certain builds. There is however a buff that increases the speed of your roll by 1 stage but it has a limited duration and a noticeable cooldown and cooldowns don't start until the duration of the buff is over. For spells and weapon abilities 10 ichor is not enough for regular ability usage without sacrificing damage or healing. The ability to switch blood codes is neat and being able to use their abilities on other blood codes gives the impression of deep customization but it's actually rather limited as blood codes that have a lot of ichor (the stuff that spells, weapon abilities and buffs cost) tend to do poorly in other areas or not have enough weight capacity to use a big weapon and still have a medium roll. This means that to use weapon abilities and buffs regularly on large weapons generally means fat rolling. There might 1 or 2 blood codes that can do it if you enchant the weapon with reduced weight at the cost of damage and block reduction. All blocking is done with weapons as there are no shields and the ranged weapons are rifles with a bayonet on the end of it for melee. The builds are based around specializing into 1 or 2 things like damage and speed or block and defense. It's the same if you want high ichor to use abilities and buffs.Being a hybrid means sacrificing a lot.The combat is based around you being carried by an ai partner who will do 75% of the work for you or trying to do it solo which is brutal because of how the hit boxes and backstabs work. The ai is very weak in the early game but becomes very powerful in the end game. It's like putting the game on low difficulty or extremely hard which results in a serious imbalance of difficulty which does not reward the player for skill and timing like the souls series. Instead you get buggy backstabs which only work half the time no matter how many times you practice it and failing a backstab results in a regular swing in which case you get hit by the enemy next to you where you would have had iframes during the backstab. This makes deep, fast paced skillful combat tricky as enemies have incredibly fast swings with little downtime in between them and always have ds1 heavy armor poise. Feel free to welcome the giant dad enemies who will stunlock you into oblivion and aggroing even 1 enemy almost always draws 5-10 more who will immediately bum rush you into a corner. The level design will also have you running in circles trying to uncover 100% of the map or collecting all the fragments in each area to unlock the blood codes in the first place and the dlc is just a cash grab with ng+ bosses in your first run of ng and restricting you to using specific builds for the challenges. The dlc bosses have great rewards such as new weapons and blood codes if you can complete the special challenges but are brutal in difficulty and the alternate outfits are a nice addition although they don't display in cutscenes.In the end the game is fun with lots of cool spells and weapon abilities to use with a story based on vampire anime lolitas and teenage boys who have bad voice acting, stale animations and boring, forgettable backstories of which there are a LOT of cutscenes for. Thankfully they can be skipped. The soundtrack is seriously amazing though.			"

Recommended,38.4,"																I don't usually review stuff, but since this game got so much unnecessary heat, I feel like I should do it.This is more an RPG than the souls franchise... Your progression, your adventures feel much more as an action RPG than it looks like once you get the hang of it, the progression and the way the story is told are pretty well paced, with difficulty spikes during boss fights.You can take your time and enjoy things as much as you want and it won't get boring.Combat is very dynamic given you have basically unlimited classes to fiddle with...

It took me 3 hours.Cons:-Can someone explain me the storyline??-The DLC's of the game is horrible. Don't get me wrong the game is good, just the DLC's are bad.			"
Recommended,124.2,"																PROS:Dark souls but anime. Definitely easier than dark souls when you have a companion but the gameplay is good. Did i mention the character creation? It is amazing and you can create basically any character you could want to. I'm halfway through the game and while the story pacing is a bit weird, I really, really like it. Also, one thing I really liked(considering I am doing this playthrough with a friend and how difficult it used to be to connect to each other in dark souls) the multiplayer system as it is SUPER SUPER EASY TO CONNECT to each other. The blood code(this game's classes) system allows you to change your build on a fly which is something i really love as i can go from the two handed sword wielding tank to a status afflicting death-by-a-thousand-cuts swordsman to a burst mage on the flyCONS:Unfortunately this game does have a lot of visual bugs that turn me off such as, especially clipping issues such as being halfway through the ground after back stabbing, hair phasing through faces and items(even in cutscenes.), my character floating off the ground. There's also weird gameplay bugs like if you light attack after a backstab, you end up starting the backstabbing animation but not going through with it. this game has been out for over a year so finding other multiplayer sessions can be hard, but there is a code vein discord ( https://discord.gg/npJ2VjM ) which is filled with helpful peopleOverall: Get it on sale, but i dont think i would give up 60 for it. Good fun game with a good story and i'm definitely going to NG+ this. The DLC isn't related to the main game at all and I wish it was, but you do get a new boss for each one, blood codes and some new weapons. if you do get it, join the discord: https://discord.gg/npJ2VjM .PS.

Recommended,118.1,"																ungabunga cool game			"
Recommended,26.8,"																Having finished this game, I can say 100% that is worth the purchase... That is if you buy it on sale. I dont think I would have paid full price for it and there is a reason of this which i'll explain later down the review.Coming from playing Dark Souls and Bloodborne I expected a similar experience to these games and while there are some similarities between Code Vein and these two, I found it to be quite different.First off, when you level up, the game allocates the stats for you, so in reality, level up as much as you can (there's something negative about this though). I'd say level up as much as you can so you get more health between each level, but be careful if you level up too much: Your Gifts (which are your abilities in this game) will get harder to master the more you level up. Consider this when you are about to go up in levels. But as I said before, leveling up is necessary mostly because of the health, since regeneration in this games are bad and having more health is always good. Also this, if you find that mastering gifts is getting too hard, then don't worry, the game gives you a way to farm every material you need for every possible upgrade, so don't worry yourself much.Let's continue. The game is clearly made to have a companion with you, otherwise it gets tediously hard, and annoying in some parts. Also the fact that having a companion features exclusive dialogues to the area you are in, so even if you don't like having a partner, I suggest carrying one anyways, because it adds to the plot and you get to like them more.Art wise the game is dull in some areas, colors lack in most of them, and the areas I find visually pleasing are mostly towards the end. Level design is alright in this game, nothing amazing but nothing bad either, it's enough for what it is.The combat in this game is in a weird spot for me. Most melee weapons you don't really feel the weight on them, especially the heavy weapons (hammers, greatswords, axes). The character moves in a strange way with them, and when you hit enemies you don't feel that explosive strength of massive weapons (and lord, some are indeed big). For regular weapons the combat is fluid and fast, it's more of a Bloodborne type of combat than Dark Souls. I recommend getting quick mobility with one handed swords since that's pretty much Bloodborne type of combat, and in my opinion the one that suits this game the most, going for builds that negate damage or makes you tanky I found it to be worthless, and it's better to dodge and not get hit at all (enemies do a lot of damage, they are complicated to stagger at times and regeneration is just overall bad).There's also parries, backstabs and drain attacks. Parries are sometimes hard and unpredictable to do them, as you have 4 different type of parries (depends on your Blood Veil) so you have to get used to whichever Blood Veil you have equipped. Backstabs aren't really backstabs, you don't have to be in the back of an enemy, but more in the sides of the back, and then you can do them. Drain attacks depend on the Blood Veil, and they are pretty cool animation wise. These three give you Ichor everytime you do them, so keep in mind to do this often. In my opinion, combat is good as it is, it has its problems for sure, and it could had more polishing to it. Casters are going to have fun with this game, since getting Ichor is easy and spells are super flashy and fun as hell to use, so if anyone likes to be a mage in these type of games have no doubt and play as one, it's worth it.One of the best parts about this game (and I'm sure everyone agrees with me here) is the character creation. It is very detailed and you can spend hours making your ultimate waifu or husbando, you have tons of options to choose from, and it is definitely one of the best parts about this game.Another important area of the game which I enjoy tremendously is the music. The soundtrack of this game is absolutely beautiful to listen, I would usually chill and listen to it using Spotify at night, it's just that good. The character interactions are also good, having them on your hub is nice, and being able to talk with them is nice too. Checking memories of the characters (which is known as Vestiges) is also probably one of the best parts of the game. Please, do them, you get so much plot details and lore I'm not even joking.Difficulty wise, I don't think it's a hard game. It's more of the problems you may encounter during your playtime, examples: Enemies hitting you through walls, getting stuck on places, getting staggered constantly for no reason, hit detection being horrible at times, enemies hitting way too much in some places.And one of the last aspects I would like to cover are the Depths, traditionally speaking: Dungeons.These are can be entered by maps, which you get by progressing through the game or NPC quests. In these dungeons you get materials to upgrade your weapons, gear and gifts, special vestiges, special equipment and so on. You can also redo them everytime you want.The only problem I find is that there aren't that many. I think the game would have been better if it had a system like Bloodborne, but it's okay as it is. Just wanted a bit more content there.Plot wise.... Well, it's nothing incredible, though I really enjoyed it. I like the lore and the implications of the past, it was definitely enjoyable from beginning to end, and at times it was what kept me playing in some days. Overall I find the game worthwile buying, that's my final verdict. I don't give ratings to game, so this is it: You find it interesting? Is it calling to you? Try the demo and see if you actually like it. Enjoyed the demo? Then buy the game. Edit: I forgot to add, with one character you can have multiple builds, you can swap blood codes as you go and abilities as you go, as long as you have them unlocked :)			"

Recommended,64.8,"																The mechanics are a bit clunky, the story is slow paced, the cut scenes are incredibly slow dialogue, that often force you to walk along at a crawl instead of just watch, and the combat to frequently seems to rely on ambushes and other cheap tactics. For a game that puts a focus on having a partner (Which I promptly turned off cus I am a soulslike diehard / masochist) it completely lacks pvp, and uses only a slightly improved system of the original clunky dark souls co-op mechanics.Now that I have all the bad stuff out of the way on to why I did give it a positive rating. While slow paced and a touch generic the Story is pretty interesting, and the way it unfolds through a mechanically important feature is also neat. The combat its self is quite solid, while not quite as streamlined as the like of the Dark Souls series or Nioh which have spoiled me, it carves out a decent niche for itself with a large host of character abilities and options, as well as weapon types. It uses many of the same formulas as darksouls, just repackaged and sold a little differently. And most of the bosses are pretty fun, challenging, and unique. While starting out is a struggle, as can be the later difficulties of the game, you can pull off some incredibly powerful character builds, some of which can borderline cheat you out of the gameplay experience, but they take some work to put together, and there are plenty of fair options as well. Having up to 8 active abilities at a time, and 4 passives, is a very nice touch that really gives each character a lot of options and a unique feel.All in all another solid game for the genere, while far from my favorite, it has been enjoyable.

Imagine being stuck in a non moving elevator for 2 minutes, then it finally moves and goes up two feet. The worst part is that if you die you have to call it back down and it  repeats the timer. Just kidding, the worst part is that there are actually two of these elevators in the area, and while you are waiting your partner gets locked out and dies.			"
Recommended,32.9,"																Anime dark souls, with waifus too. So just like dark souls, youre gonna have an absolute ♥♥♥♥ time dying and losing your items. You can die by simply getting overwhelmed by 13 swordsmen, each doing a third of your health bar. Or you can die by falling off a cliff while fighting 13 swordsmen cuz they surrounded you and you spammed the dodge button. You can also get pushed of a cliff by 13 swordsman. And when youre on your way to retrieve the items you lost, how about falling into a hole that you didnt see, cuz the game textures make everything look same, and losing 200,000 haze. My favourite part was when they threw 2 of the toughest bosses together at me and I had to play the level 50 times for 3 hours to level up. And even after that, it took me 1 hour more to defeat them cuz wtf is that AOE man. Story is anime(its good). Visiting memories of other characters was a nice addition. Added so much weight to even the side side characters whom you'll never even meet. While the memories of the main characters made me so sad. But what pushed my sadness further was the final boss who was so big that he occupied a quarter of the space available and his attacks covered half of the map. So I had to grind again to beat himGAME IZ GOOD BUY IT			"
Recommended,2.9,"																easily one of the best souls likes in a long time. its story is fantastic, and for being an anime game, its definitely top notch. it deals with story overtones of nihilism, and the futility and hope life brings. its core concept is that our memories and experiences are what make a person human, not the state of their body. its a whole hell of a lot deeper than people give it credit for. i fully expect a code vein 2.the game features a massive selection of classes, all of which ultimately contribute to your overall strength as you can mix and match 99% of the abilities from classes into other classes. its one downfall is the lack of weapon class selections. you have six choices - Bayonet, Sword, Spear, Axe, Hammer, greatsword. Axe hammer and greatsword are all VERY similar in that they are a clunky two handed fighter style that really boils down to personal preference. Spear is 2handed as well but departs from the hammer/gs/axe model. bayonets are difficult to master, but are useful mid-range fighter weapons once you do. Each weapon class has subclasses of weapons, which all feature variations on their attack paterns and general properties - they generally have fast  and heavy versions of each weapon type, with an inbetween that balances power defense and speed. The fast types generally favor speed, dodging, and staminause, while slow types favor damage, stagger, and defense. 1. Swords- Cleaver/Katana/Broadsword 2. Bayonets - Snipers/Shotguns/Spellshot (made this one up, because it lacks a name, but is a caster focused rifle)3. Greatswords - Zweihander/Greatcleaver/GreatKatana4. axes - no subtypes5. Hammer - Crush/Batter (no named types on this again, making them up to indicate what they do)6. Spears - Thrusting/Cleaving/HalberdMost importantly of all - NG+ Actually serves a purpose, as all classes are not able to be achieved in one playthrough. five hidden classes exist through fulfilling specific requirements in a playthrough, while four hidden classes exist by failing those specific requirements in a playthroughThe only two complaints i have with the game1. you cant pick the appearance of a bloodveil - so depending on your build, you might have to use armor that doesnt fit your style.2. theres not specifically a caster line of weaponry, to benefit casters. all casters are melee casters unfortunately. they have to rely on a special blood veil attack from thorn or spike type blood veils in order to build up their 'mana' from a distance.

Not Recommended,18.9,"																Code: TearsCode Vein is a Dark Souls-like open world RPG, pitting you against the scientifically undead Lost and the many political factions in your neighborhood. With a healthy range of weapons, a shining feature of its design is its incredibly open-ended class system. By mixing and matching any and all class abilities together in a set package, you can custom build to a ridiculous number of playstyles. Also you don't get invaded 24/7 by trolls so have no fear on that front.You are the Revenant, revived from death alongside a mysterious woman. With little memory of what happened, you are accosted by ruffians and forced into doing their bidding. Once the expected happens, you are set upon by the main story quest and the mysterious world around you in proper.I was quite impressed with Code Vein's combat gameplay for the most part. It suffers a little in direct comparison to Dark Souls 3 specifically, but stands up almost shoulder-to-shoulder. Some may regard it as even better in some ways. In that vein, the heavy-hitting combat and purpose-needed movement gave playing serious weight. Even lightly-equipped classes carry their own weight and feel, so you have a certain rhythm no matter what you're doing. Combined with its open ended class design, you can honestly switch up on the fly and try a new approach with little pain.The music has some definite highlights, and has high-roller theme to it with orchestra and choir-like arrangements. With the filler pieces being quite welcome, the big ones for bosses and important story moments really do drive the experience much farther forward. If I had to complain it is the shortness of the OST itself and perhaps the room for more music variance that could've been there, but wasn't.Code Vein's anime-esque art design is, well, a bit divisive. On the one hand, the world around you, the weapons, combat, graphical effects, and the such are great. If not beautiful, they work well and don't do any harm to the game. It is unashamedly an anime style, but thankfully a grounded one. The soul exception to this is the, bluntly, terrible female character design. The amount of degrading horniness surrounding them rapidly ruins a lot of otherwise well-designed female character storylines. One of your main companions is quite literally in torn rags, full on near-naked throughout the whole game, and it only gets worse from there. Predictably, none of the men have this issue. It's obvious whoever was in charge of this decision had zero pushback from the team.I rather enjoyed Code Vein's meta story, and the many subplots intertwining with it. A definite theme emerges, but rather than succumb to depressive repetition, it has an undercurrent of optimism. I hate Grim Dark as a rule, so I was quite pleased with this. The world IS dark, but it is not hopeless, if you do the work to make it that way. What unravels ended up being a very human story, in spite of everything surrounding it, and it brought an appropriate amount of feels along the way.ConclusionQuite happy in the Souls family of RPG games, Code Vein doesn't re-invent the wheel and delivers a certain quality of purpose. While it has its own design concessions, they serve to not only differ it from competitors, but offer a taste others don't readily work toward. I would say it's a great game to pick up, especially if one wants a different pace in the Souls family from the heavily western-styled approaches of others. The OST alone is quite great.			"

"
Recommended,20.1,"																Code Vein is a game I stumbled upon by chance, and was quite an impulsive buy when it was on sale this winter. Clearly one of the best 30 euros i spent.It's a very well made action-RPG in the likes of the Dark Souls series. It's actually my first encounter with such a game of this genre. It is set in a world were biologically engineered immortal humans, known as “Revenants” (basically vampires) struggle in an apocalyptical world were they fight against their thirst for blood, and battle against those who fell to their thirst, the Lost. I really liked the whole plot which I will let you discover. It’s something in the line of classic anime tragic plot yet is quite innovative and really fits this kind of game.The gameplay fits a lot the cannon world, as when you are defeated, you don’t actually die and respawn on a nearby save point know as Mistle, and your mates will call it a Tuesday. You will quickly come across friends who will fight by your side and they’re really helpful. They can save you when your HP falls below 0. I used them on my first run. They make the game be significantly easier for someone new to this genre, yet let it be quite challenging. The game is not actually that difficult per se. Early bosses will be quite daunting at first, while later bosses will take you less tries if you managed your equipment well, which was a bit disappointing to be fair. However, even though the game lets you unlock “Blood codes” (classes) and “Blood Gifts” (active and passive powers) you could really go through the whole game without grinding all the codes and trying new powers. I stuck with pretty basic powers through my whole first run and still finished it without many problems. Blood code is unique to each revenant, except you the MC, who has the power, central in the story, to get and use as many blood codes as there are. And in the end it felt quite gimmicky.I still find some monsters and bosses having particularly unfair moves but that’s probably my noob ass speaking instead of gitting gud.Musically the game is well done. Its got the OST it deserve. Nothing exactly transcendent like Skyrim’s or Dark Souls’ soundtrack, but a very fitting OST nonetheless.The game is a real treat to explorers like me, who have a compulsive need to search every bit of every level in the search of secrets. And I was not let down. You can find very valuable secrets, materials and such in hidden or well protected parts of each level. There apparently a special ending for people who have collected as many of these secrets as possible but I didn’t get it cause I’m a dumbass who looked over one of these xD ;_;Overall, this game is really nice! If you’re into Souls-like, vampire games, or anime, and are a gamer looking for a little challenge, you should give this game a try, it’ll be worth the try! This games deserves a good 7.5-8/10. It will give you a good 30 hours play time if you play like me, and at least 20 hours if you're good and fast.I hope my review help you well.			"

Recommended,235.8,"																Having finally played the game a year after release (was waiting for a sale), I think this game is fantastically fun! I've always been intimidated by souls-like games, as I'm usually a far more casual gamer. However, this game might just be my new gateway drug into the souls-like genre. Mostly because I am really enjoying the combat, and some of the grinding. Hell, I'm also enjoying the difficulty. Maybe Code Vein is just easy for a souls-like game, but I'm not finding it to be nearly as difficult as I had gone in expecting it to be. Don't get me wrong, I am routinely getting my ass handed to me. But, once I've figured an enemy encounter out, it becomes significantly easier.Either way, I'm tempted to pickup a Dark Souls game after I'm finished with Code Vein. Especially with how often they tend to go on sale on Steam these days.As far as the anime styling goes, it's a whatever thing for me. I'm not huge into anime, but I don't hate it either. If it's good, I'll enjoy it all the same.And an FYI for all my Linux peeps: Yes, this game will run perfectly fine using Proton.			"
Recommended,40.4,"																This game is underrated.			"
Recommended,87.9,"																Very fun game I've beaten it roughly four times.			"
Recommended,85.1,"																With Dark Souls being essentially the game of the last decade (Whether you like it or not), it is safe to say a host of inspirations have been made. Code Vein is one, even nicknamed “Anime Dark Souls.” But is it really just that, or is there something missing?Code Vein is alright. I think in many ways it will scratch the itch of Souls veterans but the “chuuni”Designs (Basically childishly edgy or excessively trying to be badass or cool, like a 10 year old having a WOW character named Ragnarok the Bloodspiller or something) of the characters will put some people off, but there is a…”decent” game underneath. Code Vein takes place in a post apocalyptic world (That somehow has everyone dressing like they wear exclusively Luis Vitton) in which most of humanity has been wiped out by a calamity known as the Great Collapse. With it brought terrible beast. In order to fight off these beast, humanity created revenants, humans who ingested a parasitic organism within their heart that require blood to not survive, but to stay sane. When they don’t get regular doses they risk becoming Lost, psychotic mutated beast that slaughters friend or foe (So much for saving humanity I guess?) You play as an anime, and not just any anime, you have a special power that allows you to blah blah blah.Story is a bit melodramatic, with many of the backstory of the characters being relegated to “Sad Music Corridors” that kind of become a punchline as you get further and further through the game. It would have been better suited to weave the characters backstories either into the plot, or through sidequest.One unique gameplay mechanic that the game brings to the table is the blood code system. Blood codes are kind of like classes that you can switch between on the fly, giving you access to loads of abilities and playstyles. Want to play a rolling brute? Then better get your hand on Yakumo’s blood code. Is a speedster mage more your speed? Maybe try out one of the Succesor blood codes. I found this system to be a nice change of pace, but in the end I found many of the abiltieis to be too situational to be that useful, and the ones that aren’t end up breaking the game wide open. The game also lets you have a companion for the entirety of the gameplay, so Code Vein does have steps to mitigate the difficulty.The game also has a problem with lack of enemy variety, and generally after playing to the halfway point, outside of bosses, you won’t really be seeing anything new. They also have a tendency to really throw too many at you at once, and during the early game it can be a bit obnoxious to have conga lines of enemies chasing you to hell and back. (A problem I had with Dark SOuls 2. Why take notes from the worst one, though?)Being a Souls veteran ( and yes, I do like the smell of my own farts), I found the bosses to be subpar with some cheap tactics but a few standouts like the Gilded Hunter, The Skull King, and Stripper Miku were nice fights. Everything else was pretty generic, such as the Berserker Wolf, and the Queen’s Knight (Which they make you fight twice)! I did try to beat all the bosses solo, but I found the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer fight to be completely unfair, so I used a companion and didn’t feel bad about it at all. I didn’t beat the Final Boss, but I was kind of tired of the game at that point, and they gave it lots of obnoxious resistances that made it a chore to fight. What’s weird was the Skull King was a phenomenal boss, so it’s like eating your cake first, and then having to eat some tofu broccoli or whatever right afterwards.While playing this game, you can even see one of the major things that are missing from this SOulslike is good level design. Many of the Blood Vessels (Which obtaining them all is necessary to get the true ending.) are tucked away in areas that are quite out of the way and somewhat a pain to get to at times. Environments have a bit of variety to them, so that might help matters.All in all, there are things to like but the Soulsbourne series give you hundreds of hours of content that is more refined if you haven’t played them, and you would find Code Vein lacking in many departments if you had. Although there are female characters with large tits, so if you are a coom addict that might do it for you I guess. It does have some nice production value, and I did like some parts of the game. But definitely can’t see myself ever playing it again (Might come back to beat the final boss as stuff like that tends to bug me, but at the same time no point playing a game you don’t enjoy.)			"

It runs pretty well, it is not immensely challenging and can be completed in small segments at a time.I see a lot of people disappointed in the combat system and I will give this in response: If you regularly play games like this, then the combat is probably going to be very easy. But, if you do not play a lot of games like this, then it will be reasonably challenging.Overall, I'd probably give this game a 7/10			"

Recommended,18.6,"																Well since i played dark souls 3 i thought ""Anime souls?!"" why not.Turns out i really like this game, you dont have as many weapons as in DS3 but what you get is more than enough and you can upgrade it! you can parry and back stab ""timings are diff for each bloodveil"" Boss fights can be challenging, but with the right setup and buffs you can get through it once you know their mechanics and movements.The story and sub stories of each companion is pretty interesting and makes you want to unlock the next part of their stories. The move sets are decent and improves or hinders you depending on what you equip in the slots, but once you get the hang of it its a no brainer. You can play as a tank / mage / dex/ what ever you want and switch between them on the fly, that in itself makes this game stand out in a sense, you can be a hard hitting slow tank one moment and a fast moving spell casting punisher the next with a sword that deals good damage and replenishes you ichor ""spell fodder"" with the right things equipped...The dlc add on is not worth it in my opinion, you get 3 new bosses and areas that are near impossible to beat and you gain rewards ""mediocre at best"" depending on how you fight them from new weapons to blood veils to other less than useless things, The 3 towers tests your ability to fight and is a good way to get better. only its an end game thing sooo...arena style grind. All in all i would recommend this game as its a hell of a lot of fun just skip the dlc add on content as its not worth the price. Waifu souls / anime souls (how ever you want to view it) its a fun game that needs to be played. Dont just rush through it, explore and find everything you can to upgrade your equipment and unlock the stories.			"
Recommended,206.3,"																It's a souls-like with NPC co-op enabled by default, but you can opt out of it if you want to. Character creator has a lot of options but they're all anime as hell and there's not much you can do with your body shape, so don't come in expecting to bring your favorite OC to life perfectly. Music is by Go Shiina, who also worked on the God Eater soundtrack and several Tales of Series titles, so you're in for a treat. Overall story is somewhat nonsensical and silly, but as long as you're willing to suspend your disbelief you'll find plenty of emotional engagement in the various character stories that get expanded upon as the story progresses. The blood code system and the flexibility in building out your character is highly engaging and allows you to tailor your character to your playstyle. Bosses are almost all memorable and unique, with mechanics and abilities that continue to challenge you on subsequent playthroughs and rematches. Highly recommended.			"

Recommended,128.6,"																Music - GoodAesthetic - GoodCharacters - GoodStory - Cliche but goodCharacter Customization - Good-----------------Combat - Neutral Boss Fights - neutral ------------------this is my first Souls like game so im completely new to the genre, so the first hours i kept dying over and over, slowly learning the patterns and routes. Everything was going fine i had fun at the challenge and it was a good run until the end of the first boss. The game is fun and i advise not to run the partner mechanic because it makes the game a lot more challenging because theres no free revives and the partner can act as bait to the bosses and you find its weak areas and just spam attack. I am a firm believer that the two handed weapons in the game are the best because its super powerful and two hits, even one hits if you optimize the build, most enemies in the game. So you kinda just breeze right after the first boss fights. And thats a problem in this game, i still stuck to the same blood codes because nothing really stood out better in terms of stats and builds. Weapons too are very limited as you realize you find yourself using the same beginner weapons sort of, the NPC weapons you obtain by trading are the best in the game so you do that early game and you never switch out of it. If i had to change i would want more options in weapons and blood veils and the option of modifying blood veils to fit your character build. I dont want to use the same blood veil if it looks bad design wise but stats are good so it would be an extra incentive to be able to use whatever veil you want. Overall im on my second playthrough and probably play more of it, but for now i like this game a lot and it keeps me hook enough to keep playing but the reason is because i love character customization in games so seeing my in game character interact is the best.

Recommended,17.9,"																Good game. The character creator is well done. Combat is fun and there is a lot of build variety. It isn't too long or too short, just the right length. The visuals are great for the most part, though some areas are kind of  monotonous visually. Level design isn't great, some areas are well done and some are pretty bad, more good than bad overall. Characters are nothing ground breaking but they are all likeable and I did care about them. The world is actually pretty interesting and the story was engaging throughout. It wasn't a particularly difficult game, but it wasn't easy either. Compared to other souls-like games it holds up decently, but I believe that it offers it's own unique experience that you will not find in any other souls-like. A sequel would be very interesting.			"
Recommended,34.2,"																A game that seems like a meme at first glance but provides the same quality of story and gameplay expected of any of the Souls games. A large variety of weapons and abilities makes it easy to customize your character to play the way you want and there are very few objectively ""bad"" options to speak of.The NPC ally that you have to accompany you through the game provides helpful pointers from time to time, witty quips at others, and while they definitely make this game easier than other Souls games it's a good feeling and reinforces that banding together in a situation like this makes everything easier to survive.All in all this game is more than worth the money spent. Also waifus. So many waifus...			"
Recommended,58.3,"																This one has definitely been a grower. Souls games are my favourite series of all time and this game emulates a similar experience in a unique new setting. The game has some flaws that make it inferior to other titles of fromsoft but this one was not made with being a souls game in mind. The areas have lots of shortcuts and loops that make it convenient to go around but are usually just uninteresting corridors that all look similar.The magic in this game is a lot more interesting than the ones in souls though. You will use at least some form of magic even if you are a pure melee because that's how good it was incorporated into the builds of this game.The story was alright but sadly it prefers shoving cutscene upon cutscene into your gameplay to convey a narrative. I just ended up skipping most of it due to how ubiquitous it is that your gameplay is interrupted by a slow walk in some shadow realm as you are told about some sob story of a character you don't even meet in the game.The enemy design for the most part felt like they were just reskins of old enemies but the bosses were quite good.But it wouldn't be a code vein review if I didn't praise the character creation. And yes, it is glorious.In the end, I guess I really wouldn't mind a sequel to Waifu Souls.			"
Recommended,78.1,"																This game really feels like it wants to be a hybrid between Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2. In the same vein it even has characteristics of Demon's Souls. Using the souls-like format, it incorporates everything we love about anime into it and it does it very well. There are some nice meaningful bosses towards the end with enjoyable characters to talk to and the story even holds up for multiple playthroughs. The deluxe is a steal on sale and well worth its dollars at full price. It doesn't do anything new but it sure loves its dark souls hidden ledges. Also, if you loved swinging your black knight's Halberd in Dark Souls 1, I have some very good news, halberds are great in this and there is an OP build for them just like DS1.			"

Recommended,20.8,"																I was pleasantly surprised with this new IP from developers that create God Eater series. . There are definitely plenty of flaws in this game, but hopefully they will perfect it in the sequel or their future IP. A lot of people call it a “weeb soul-like game,” which I don’t agree, but since many people are familiar with those games, I will use them to make comparison. Let’s get the good stuff out of the way1. OST 9/10 – It beautifully fits the universe Code Vein sets in. Listening to the music in this game was the best part of playing this game, at least for me. 2. Optimization 9/10 – I played this game in sept 2020, and I’m guessing a lot of bugs were patched already. I had zero crash and experienced zero frame drop. I think I had worse frame drop with Dark Souls 1 & 2 than I did with Code Vein3. Map design 8/10 – I had a great time admiring the visual of this game. Maps were beautiful to look at especially the cathedral, and they really seemd to fit well with Code Vein Universe. I would’ve given them higher score for the map design, if they they hadn’t re-used too many of assets, and several maps felt exactly the same. Especially the Depth maps were atrocious, and it had no originality whatsoever. This one is for visual only, and I separated “exploration” for a good reason. 4. Story 7/10 – I think the story is slightly above average. There were lots of good moments, and honestly they did a phenomenal job creating a bleak distopian world with many interesting characters striving to survive hopeless situations. However, while this game started out strong with great world and characters, this game suffers the same problems that a lot of apocalyptic anime like Attack on Titan have, which is not actually taking advantage of the apolocalyptic nature of the world.  There were many cliches in the game that resembled a hero’s journey story we typically encounter in many other JRPGs. And this is a problem because why did they create a unique distopian story if they were just gonna follow the same story structure in other JRPGs. After they finished explained the story and we delved deeper into the game, we are left wondering what purpose does this distopian universe serve? Nontheless, I did enjoy the story overall, and I am hoping for a sequel to expand Code Vein universe, but the story could’ve been much better. 5. Boss fights 8/10 – Really great boss fights. Lots of unique mechanics, and honestly it’s quite satisfying to see these bosses.  5. Combat 6/10 – Combat in Code vein is a significant improvement from Shift’s other IP, God Eater, but I’m afraid it’s still lackluster compare to other action RPG games. I’ve played Monster hunter world, DS, Sekiro, Toukiden,  Onimusha, DMC, and etcs. The flow of the combat in this game feels much closer to Onimusha or DMC than Souls game. It’s more fast paced, and players can rely a lot heavily on skills. Overall combat feels much easier compare to other Soul-like game for the following reasons. 1. You can always bring a partner. 2. Skills are very effective in this game. The problem I have with the combat in this game is the clunkiness. Compare to other recent souls game, it still needs improvement. Parrying doesn’t even work properly sometimes. And more often than not I experience my hits missing the target even thought it cut through the opponent and vice versa. This doesn’t mean that the combat itself is complete garbage. They are reusing the combat system from God Eater, which I definitely enjoy, and I do hope they continue to improve in their future IP. 6. Exploration 3/10 – There is none. Map design is pretty great, but there is really no reason to explore anything other than to finish side quests. Secrets are way too easy to find, and there aren’t any incentives to explore. Running Trial of Blood seems to be the best ways to farm anything. 7.  Enemies 4/10 – Bosses were great, and some mobs are fun to fight against. But it’s get repetitive extremely fast. Why? Cuz they are basically reusing the same mob with just different skin. 8. UI 3/10 – It gets so tedious to manage your blood code and weapons. You can’t even check which skills a blood code has unless you rest at a mistle. 9. Replayability: 4/10 – Unfortunately, I didn’t see the need to replay the game other than to watch the endings. Sure there were weapons, blood code to collect in NG+, but again they just reused skins of several weapons, and blood code were well not as enticing as playing as a different class in Dark Souls. I I’d say some other people would enjoy trying out the blood codes, but I firmly believe many were disappointed with the choices of weapons in this game. Since there was barely any exploration, it also contributes to reducing replayability in Code Vein. ConclusionOverall, I would give this game 7~7.5/10. I had a great experience with this game, but I clearly experienced many flaws. Please keep in mind that, while this isn’t their first IP, this is their first Souls-like IP. If you enter into Code Vein universe looking for Dark Souls, there is high chance you might be disappointed cuz this is a different game. However, if you are looking for a different experience and enjoy a difficult challenge, you will have a great time. P.s : unfortunately, I didn't play the DLC. From what I heard, they weren't great....			"

Recommended,42.7,"																One of the few good ''souls-like'' game.[GAMEPLAY]The game is easier than Dark Souls, but you can make it way harder if you play solo(without companion), the game offers a good variety of classes(Blood Codes) that you can change whenever you want to, each class has a unique skillset that you can use on other classes if you master that skill. The game also offers many different weapons with unique movesets and special attacks, and various armors with each having a different devour attack.[GRAPHICS]Graphics are pretty decent and it runs very smoothly.[BOSS AND LVL DESIGN]Bosses are interesting, with unique mechanics and abilities, the different areas offer you a variety of different enemies to fight with and they are big enough for you to explore.(Cathedral is the worst are change my mind...)Overall i really like the experience that this game can offer you.I didn't finish the game yet so i might update this with new information :3.			"
Recommended,424.3,"																This game is often described as a Souls-like. This is solely because the combat slightly resembles that of the Dark Souls series. Almost everything else about it is vastly different.There's some decent character creation, and the game encourages mixing its distinct Blood Codes (classes with pre-defined stat blocks). Putting Gifts (spells) from different Blood Codes together allows for some truly devastating combinations. Surprisingly, I might say I prefer this game's combat to that of the Souls series, simply because it feels more tight and animations are usually easier to read. The game also runs better than Dark Souls III on my PC, so I am biased.Enemy variety is lacking but not too bothersome. Map design is often sub-par but, aside from one level (if you've played the game, you know the one), is inoffensive. Boss quality ranges from unimpressive to among the best in the genre.The plot is anime as hell and the world is not particularly well handled. Still, there's something entertaining about how over-the-top it is.tl;dr it's a decent game which allows more freedom of customization per playthrough than most other games in the genre. Get it on sale and skip the DLC unless some partner outfits and gear with strange stat scaling are worth the price, because the bosses sure aren't.			"

Recommended,48.6,"																Code Vein is a pretty decent entry into the Souls like series. It has both strengths and weaknesses which I shall cover!In terms of positives, the game has an excellent character creator, which helps you make your own little Wifu right off the bat. It is honestly one of the best character creators I have seen, especially for a Souls like game who typically only allow you to create something between a Geiger inspired nightmare or a mistake. Sort of miffed that the story NPCs seem to have unique appearances that you simply cannot have. Maybe I wanted to have huge, unwieldy breasts like Io or Candy. Additionally, the game has a fairly good soundtrack. nothing you'll remember in a year or so, but suitable to help set the mood for your adventure. The sound in general is fairly well done from voice acting, combat and spell sounds and general sound effects.Finally the presentation is pretty delightful. Though you spend the first few hours in some rough looking cities and tunnels, you eventually get to explore snowy mountains, a strange fortressy place and a desert! Ooooh. I admit though, that after a while, everything does start look a little samey. Onto what I don't like.While generally the combat is good, the weapons are a bit lack luster. You'll be given a choice between a weapon that is heavy or light, heavy doing more damage, light being faster. However, despite swinging a heavy weapon about and hitting with some force, the enemy reacts the same as if you hit them with a light weapon. Granted they take more damage, but it makes the weapons feel a little less immersive. You suddenly don't feel as impressive with your heavy hammer when a light steel pipe seems to have as much impact. The plot and several plot elements could afford to be a little more fleshed out. I won't go into spoilers, but the game seems to have taken a lesson from Dark Souls in that it does not tell you everything or explain all the factions, but has clues and item descriptions as well as a few conversations to fill in some information. However the game explains enough of the plot to make you feel like there's something missing, but just that little bit too much is explained that it doesn't feel like it is missing because of a lost history or the fall of man, but just because someone didn't bother writing it. There's also a huge twist in act 3 of the game's story, revealing the setting for the game that, while it didn't bother me so much, seemed really out of place, throwing the narrative off a bit, especially if you take into account the true ending. Finally, the DLC is awful. It is a short dungeon run or two that is altogether uninteresting and contained some major bugs on launch.Overall the game is fairly good. It is a decent first attempt at entering the souls-like genre but a sequel or true expansion would need some work. The difficulty scaling could also use a look at. Most of the game is fairly easy but the last few bosses REALLY ramp up the difficulty. Also giving the player a little more agency in their ending would be nice. You essentially do not 'choose' the ending you get per se. I got the best ending first time, not because I made certain choices, fought certain bosses or played a certain way, but just because I did a little more looking around. I accidentally got the best ending by doing a lot of exploring. So yeah, worth a play, but ideally get it on sale. 			"

Recommended,66.6,"																Finished the game. It's a hardcore CRINGE feast.-Bad mainstory with decent sidestories.-Way too much back and forth fast travel all over the world like with DS3.-Don't even try playing this game without npc companion. it makes this game 30x harder aaaand impossible against a duoboss.+Actually cool boss attack effects...-Just that the attacks themselves are not well done. Which makes the bossfights just chaos as there are NO visual difference between a singel and a chain moveset.-Maps are decent looking but become boring as they use same enemies through all of the game. -Broken builds where you can deal 100k dmh (ONESHOT) bosses with right build.-1 weapon is unrivaled in pure physical dmg and has 96% (if enchanted 100%) immunity to enemy attacks when used while blocking.--Decent camera with a VERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ made lockon that doesn't lock on unless enemy is in Middle of the screen AND without anything covering it like a treebranch or something... so many times I turned camera to lock on.. And instead of locking on it reset camera to character fov. and have to do it all again.. And can't lock on before walking around that corner which gives the enemy the upper hand and first move every time.---EXTREMELY BAD/boring weapon moveset.---EXTREMELY BADly made way to show backstory ""memories"" which you HAVE to walk through long paths for a few lines of backstory and a new ability... feels like a pain in the ass to do just get get all the abilities. Sadly this is where the interesting story can be found, though it feels boring after doing it 10 times and I lost interest in the story here too... And you have 30+ more to go through......------Last boss is not the hardest boss, is not the best looking boss, is not the coolest boss, is not the most BS boss... it's just like a ordinary boss tbh which is sad as it's the Grand Finale.I Think it's worth the money becuase it's a actually a nice looking game..But don't buy it because it's still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ darksouls copy with bad fighting mechanics.Only safistfaction you can get is by soloing the entire game... good luck with that, like playing Darksouls NG+4 with a freshly made NG character.

Just don't buy the DLC unless you *really* like the God Eater games and want to prove that you don't have to be a supersoldier to take an Aragami down, and even then I'd suggest buying one at *best*. But the combat was more fun and nuanced then what you get out of a typical Souls-Like, and the ability to change your build to fit the needs of the fight did a lot to overcome issues such as suboptimal builds permanently screwing a character over. 9/10, would definitely play the sequel.			"
Recommended,53.8,"																I like it.  It's a weird niche game, definitely watch reviews and gameplay vids before you take the plunge to be sure you might enjoy it too.  Character creation is SUPER fun, lots of options, and the weapons are creative >:D			"
Recommended,54,"																Just replay Dark Souls for the 10th time... trust me. Early on, the game seems promising: interesting setting, fast but familiar combat system, anime aesthetic (if youre in to that), but it quickly devolves into one of the most repetitive, frustrating and mentally exhausting games I have ever played. At first I thought the never-ending, nearly-indecipherable labyrinth-style maps were just the gimmick of the early-game areas. Nope. Every single area in the game is the same: a sprawling maze of the same passageways and rooms copy-pasted an infinite number of times, with no landmarks of any kind. This is obviously bad from a gameplay perspective, but it also provides no world-building, and gives the different areas zero personality or memorability.On top of the problems with the level design, the enemies are lackluster to say the least, as they are just re-skins of the enemies from previous areas. This wouldnt have been a huge problem if the bosses had been well-designed and interesting, but they arent. Every boss in the game so far (I got about 70% of the way into game) has various AOE and untelegraphed attacks, which they string together in near-infinite combos, giving you no breathing room or windows to attack or heal. This is a lazy way make bosses feel ""difficult"" and when you finally manage to win it doesnt feel like an earned victory like it does in Dark Souls. Its more of a ""well thank RNGesus that seizure-inducing ordeal is finally over."" Now, I can already hear suggestions that I ""git gud"" to which I say: This is the opinion of someone decently competent at Dark Souls, and who has played through it multiple times solo, and has an understanding of what makes it so difficult (at least initially) and rewarding in the long-run.Dark Souls fans looking for a new souls-like experience should probably skip this one.

But it works and that is all that matters in the end.Probably because I always felt I had the choice. Choice of my builds, choice where to spend my experience without being punished by endless grind, choice to play with or without NPC. (BTW game goes from easy to very hard if you play without NPC)A relaxing dark soul lite with heavy character custom and flexible build is what would describe this game best.I enjoyed it a lot.			"
Recommended,315.5,"																Yeah this game is anime dark souls. You got bonfires and the likes, you got your souls, you got your weapon infusions with fire, electric, poison, etc. Lots of weapon variety like halberds, greatswords, bayonets, short-swords. Its great if you like Dark Souls. What sets this game apart is character customization, and its own unique way of taking on lots of different play-styles by different blood-codes, which are classes that favor magic builds, ranged builds, melee builds. And even those have specific variations. Also, I have found that it is an easy to follow story and lore so if Dark Souls never made sense to you and it turned you off, this story is followable and you can even explore the lore through ""memories"". Good Game.			"
Recommended,41.8,"																Code Vein is an anime style action RPG kind of like a SOULS series game.  The game has more CONS than PROS in my opinion and I will list them all for you right here.  First the good.. excellent co-op connection with hardly any wait time at all to get into your friends game or vice versa.  Graphics look nice with plenty of different builds for your characters to keep things interesting.  Light attacks, strong attacks and special abilities strung together to destroy foes is average at best.  CONS:  SIMPLE LEVEL DESIGN IS BORING, EVERY LEVEL HAS THE SAME COPY & PASTE BROKEN DOWN CARS AND BUILDINGS.  NO REAL SECRETS OR DEPTH TO LEVELS OTHER THAN BRANCHING PATHWAYS.  BOSS BATTLES ARE EASY AND REQUIRE LITTLE TO NO STRATEGY.  ONE OF MY BIGGEST COMPLAINTS.. CUT SCENES ARE UNINSPIRED AND DOWNRIGHT BORING.  ALSO CUT SCENES ARE INSANELY AND OBNOXIOUSLY WAY TOO LONG FOR NO REASON.  YOU WILL LITERALLY JUST RATHER STOP PLAYING THAN CONTINUE WATCHING.  With so many better souls-like games out there this one is very hard to recommend.  I would NEVER play this game solo I would just be bored to death.  There is SOME fun to be had in CO-OP but not much.  I would rather play Ashen or The Surge l & ll than CODE VEIN.  And of course, Sekiro and Dark Souls rein supreme still.			"

Recommended,37,"																I've been looking for a game to scratch my Dark Souls itch, and I'm gald I found this.  If I were to describe Code Vein, I'd say it's an anime-JRPG-meets-Dark-Souls; it's got a story, music, nakama, character customization, clothes, and massive weapons, tough enemies and hostile environments. What makes the story so good is that it's tied to different parts of the gameplay mechanics.  Of course there are cut scenes and dialog, but the really interesting part though is in order to unlock some skills, you have to walk through someone's memories, and that adds another dimension on your companions and their backstories.  I thought this was a great touch.  Even so, it's nice to have a non cryptic story that can be followed.  This game comes with useful companions, which is a departure from the Souls formula.  You can choose to play on your own, but that's extra hard mode, normally you'll be picking a companion to play with; you can switch them in and out depending on the situation, no penalty.  The companions aren't annoying, and they provide useful commentary sometimes.  Despite them being there, that 'lonely desolate' feeling of being in hostile environments doesn't go away, which is part of the appeal of these games.  There's also a 'home base' where all of you companions lounge together; you can talk to them and exchange items, upgrade things, buy things.  Really well thought through. The best part of the mechanics was the interplay between Blood Codes, Blood Veils and skills/weapons. The Codes give you stats, the Veils boost your stats, skills/weapons are boosted by the stats.  It sounds abstract but gets easy once you start using them.  This was my favorite part of the mechanics, that you weren't limited to one specific play style, you could just switch to a tank, or a melee, or a magic-melee mix, whatever you feel comfortable with.  One criticism - the coop is mediocre.  It's hard to find people sometimes, and when they join, you cannot use mistles (the bonfire equivalent).  If you defeat a boss, the guest gets kicked.  If you die, the guest gets kicked.  While this would be OK in a normal souls game, the 'multiplayer' (which only allows 1 guest) aspect allows you to summon anywhere, so it feels like it should just allow coop all the way through all levels.  But looking at the restrictions, it only makes sense if you're getting help with bosses.  Overall - yes, recommended.  You don't even need to wait for a sale.			"

Recommended,77.6,"																Code Vein is a Souls-like anime game and it plays like one. Surprise?Pros:- Character creation is expanse- Co-op to play with 1 friend- Anime!- Many different skills and skill trees- Fully customize yourself with said skills- Frustrating combatCons:- Okay but forgettable story- No shared story progression with co-op play (must play through stages twice)- Long cut scenes that disturb co-op play after defeating bosses (host watches while other player gets kicked)- Frustrating combatOverall, the good outweighs the bad. If you like Anime and you like Souls-likes, then this game puts it together for you. To me it's not worth the full price point but on sale it's an okay deal. A great buy if it ever gets to $20.See you on the other side,Godspeed!			"

Recommended,95,"																I am a bit hesitant if I want to recommend this game or not.I will however do so and hope people actually read:- DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SOULS-LIKE GAMEThis game is a 6/10 if you enjoy GOD EATER - if not... you better like anime and lackluster story with action combat. If any of these things apply to you, you will get your money back in entertainment. If not .. buy another game many good games out there.Combat is hella fun, but the game is super repetitive and all the Areas look and feel familiar. What was OK in God Eater as the Bosses make the main Attraction of the Game but it does feel kinda exhausting in this game.  The Music was very enjoyable and kept me entertained a good portion of the game.The Game is supposed to be replayed and you should enjoy doing some special side-quest (simliar to Missions in GE) but.. I just dont feel the motivation to do this (yet- maybe later).			"
Recommended,181.2,"																Waifu creator made me like Code Vein more than I probably would have otherwise. The game is a very simple take on the Souls formula with some elements that help make it stand out a bit on it's own (like being able to cross your abilities with other blood codes after you master them). I wouldn't say the difficulty is on the same level as Dark Souls, but Code Vein still offers a pretty decent challenge. There is also some solid replay value. Once you complete the game, you are able to run through again in New Game Plus (with the option of either keeping the difficulty the same or bumping it up). The game itself took me close to 40 hours. I personally enjoyed my time with the game, more than likely going to have another round with it!			"

Being that I have played all 3 souls games and bloodborne I felt at home. The story is amazing in my opinion, the character development was perfect and well paced, and the whole game felt very fair. At some points it did jump in difficulty, but it felt natural. The game does a very good job of teaching you without holding your hand in a way that the SoulsBorne series seems to be unable to do. Highly recommend if you love a challenge. also a major plus is the Co-op feels very nice and actually works very well.			"

Recommended,246.7,"																Code Vein is easily my favorite non-From Software ""Souls-like"" game, to date. Gameplay ticks all the classic From mechanics, with a blend of God Eater, much in the way Nioh has the blend of Souls and Ninja Gaiden. The character creator is one of the best out there (but only if making edgy MC's or hot/cute waifus is up your alley, honestly).The ability system (Called Gifts, in this game) is incredibly diverse, allowing for heavy build customization without being too overly complicated. Though it can take some getting used to, if you are more familiar with the systems From has in place. Leveling is simplified to simply increasing health, stamina, and base damage output, and stats are tied to specific equippable ""Blood Codes.""The term ""Anime Souls"" gets thrown around a lot when describing this game, but it is a pretty accurate descriptor, once you boil it all down.Overall, the base game is more than worth it. The DLC's, while not bad in and of themselves, are not at all worth the full price. Worth getting on sale though if you find you enjoy the game and want a bit more, as the DLC bosses are amazing fights and the added abilities/Blood Codes are great. But just make sure you don't expect too much, as you can burn through all three DLC areas unfortunately quick.Code Vein isn't a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination. But ultimately, it is incredibly fun, and has a lot of replay value (and screenshot potential).			"

Recommended,58.8,"																I'll be making this review by comparing it to the Dark Souls series, because the devs say that this is their take on the Soulsborne formula.Presentation(+) VERY annie-may. Just look at the gameplay trailer.(+) Anime post apocalyptic world. If you like God Eater's world, or the first Darksiders, you'll like this.(-) Sometimes a bit overkill with the bloom effect and color contrasts. Certain area might be a little hard on the eyes. Lost Izalith hard.(-) Small amount of enemy variation. Some enemies are recolor/retexture of earlier enemies, wielding different weapons.(-) Repetitive music. You'll hear the combat track a lot. The boss music is the same for all bosses.Combat/Exploration(+) (On-the-fly) class change system. There are many Blood Codes (class) to choose from; each Code has its own strength, but it mostly boils down the balance between STRength, DEXterity, MiND, WILlpower, Ichor (Mana), Max Weight, base Mobility, and the Code's unique skill. Example: the Berserker code has high STR, high Max Weight, but low Ichor. This means you can equip heavier armors without resorting to fat rolls, can equip STR-based weapon (and take advantage of the weapon's STR-scaling), but low Ichor means you can't easily spam skills. Another example: the Darkseeker has good DEX, MND, WIL, can equip unique passive (regenerates Ichor for every enemy damaged by a Venom tic in vicinity), but low STR. This means the Darkseeker prefers to poison enemies using DEX weapons and spells, then spam skills (weapon skills or both ""light"" and ""dark"" spells because of decent MND and WIL) with the Ichor regenerated by your weapon attacks (more on that below) and from the Venom tic.You can change the class, the passive skills, the active skills, and the equipments anytime you can access the Inventory menu.(+) 8 active skills ready at your disposal. These skill vary from weapon class-specific skills, active buffs, offensive spells, and utility spells. Borrowing from God Eater, every hit of your weapon generates Ichor, so you can never run out of mana in battle. Special attacks using your Blood Veil (your armor, which is actually a blood-sucking apparatus) either through the charged attack, special combo ender, backstab, or riposte generates more Ichor AND increases your maximum Ichor (until you die).(+) Competent companions. You can have one AI companion following you. They use different weapons and skill loadout; so no companion feels the same. They CAN die, but most of the time on your first playthrough, they die because they just revived your pathetic noob ass (reviving gives part of the reviver's HP to the target), then somehow got hit. They WILL carry you. If you are annoyed by their voices, you can disable their voices. OR, you can disable them entirely and you will lose nothing. Io's the best daughteru.(+) You have a minimap. It tracks your footsteps, so you can easily backtrack or explore by looking at your recorded footsteps. Initially, an area's map will have no map outline. When you get to the ""map piece"", it'll unlock some part of the area. Unlocking 100% of an area map is an optional sidequest in itself.(+) Training area to test your build.(-) The game's balanced around you having a companion. When you go solo (or your companion died), you may feel the game got suddenly harder. Enemies will gang up on you (and there are lots of them), and one clean hit from an enemy can be the end of you. Your effective HP is actually smaller compared to other Soulslike, because when you die, 95% of the time the companion will (instantly) revive you.(-) The game's balanced around you having a minimap. The maps can be insanely mazelike, with out of sight drop points that leads to unexpected area. The Cathedral WILL test your patience. It's like Blighttown/the Gutter but cranked up to eleven.(-) No interconnected area like Soulsborne. The area progression is quite linear, with only 1 distinct branch at the beginning. Each area even have a long winding road for the sole purpose of loading the next area.(-) Like Soulsborne, there are damage types. Like Soulsborne, there are no good indication whether or not an enemy is weak to certain damage types or not.(-) Small amount of enemy variations. You'll see that giant lady / giant masked dude a lot, and you already know to beat them in the endgame area because you constantly fight them in previous areas.Character Appearance(+) THE BEST customization option for a Soulslike. Other than your standard face/hair/body shapes/color, you can customize your eye sheen, irises, sclera, heterochromia (of course), hair highlights, clothing part, dangly accessories, and part colors/textures.(+) You technically can only select a full body costume, but every costume have parts that can be disabled. For example, some costume has pouches or frills that can be disabled/enabled. Each costume have color channels. For every channel, you can choose a color or a pattern. Some patterns can have different cloth texture.(+) Rich accessorization. It includes gloves, hats, pouches, rings, hair attachments, and assorted dangly bits. You can stack your accessory gloves with your costume's built-in gloves. You can stack hats. You can stack bangs. Every (non-gloves) accessory can be attached to a hard point (e.g. top of the head, lower waist, right ankle, left arm, etc), then adjusted (size, X, Y, rotation). You can make your character wear a hat on their left boob if you want.(+) The backstab/riposte mini-cutscene zooms to your character's face. So you can enjoy your meticulous face customization. You can turn this off.(+) You can disable your Blood Veil if it interferes with your fashion.(-) For its depth, the costume selection is actually pretty limited. There are no costume with a proper skirt for example.Character Progression(+) Equipments (i.e. Weapons and Blood Veils) can be upgraded to +10 (doubles the initial stat). Upgrading requires Code Vein's equivalent of souls and upgrade mats. Much later on, you can buy upgrade mats until +9, with the mat for +10 can be farmed.(+) Equipments can be altered. Using a special rare upgrade material, you can for example add Fire damage to a weapon. That same material can be used to alter your Blood Veil so that its drain attack also have Fire damage, and also upgrades its Fire resistance. Altering is non-permanent.(+) Most skills (except class-unique skills) can be double unlocked to be able to be used by other class. First you unlock its usage in a class using ""souls"". After that, using that class with that skill equipped, you kill enemies to ""master"" it for other class to use. Alternatively, you can skip the EXP grind using special rare drops.(+) The majority of weapons in a weapon class are sidegrades. Even the starter Queenslayer Blade is a viable endgame one-handed sword option. Each weapons have different stat requirement, base stat, stat scaling, and moveset to differentiate from each other.(~) No point-buying system. You use ""souls"" to level up your character. Leveling up only increases your base damage (which is then multiplied by your class' stats) and HP.Story/Characters/Storytelling(+) There are a good amount of emotional moments and character developments. For every companion, home base NPC, and some outside NPC, there are (fetch) sidequests to unlock their backstory. These backstories are in the form of recording, so you can hear the emotion in the voice acting.(+) Option for spoken language.(~) Coming from Soulsborne, the storytelling may threw you off because Code Vein uses JRPG-like cutscenes instead of Soulsborne's story breadcrumbs.(~) Some fanservice for God Eater fans. Nothing much, but for non-GE players, it may seem kinda annoying.(+) Io's the best daughteru.I may not have hundreds of hours in this game, but I enjoyed it very much.			"

Recommended,24.5,"																I've been struggling to really get into a game due to lack of story, diversity, and game play. This game has it all. The story I struggled with in the beginning but the beautifully done backstory and cut scenes has made me invest in the characters and what happens to them. The diversity comes from the weapons, moves and codes. Realizing that you could max out the proficiency with a code would let you use it with other codes made me stoked. I've been trying to max out all the moves from a particular code, then organizing different combos to use. It's really interesting how depending on the area or enemy I will use a different code/setup. This is something new to me since after the beginning of a game, you're stuck with one ""type"" of setup. Lastly, the actual enemies and game play are smooth. The enemies are easy at times and tough at others. Due to the vast quantity (and quality) of moves/spells (whatever they're actually called), I can plan accordingly by either setting a trap or smashing my way through. Lastly, I'm really glad they allow you the opportunity of having an NPC at your side. Having two kids makes it so my play times are late at night, when all my friends are asleep. I will definitely be doing a new game+ when I finish this game.			"
Recommended,39.2,"																Yeah, the base game is a pretty good souls-like game, even better than DS3 (yes, I really think it's better than Dark Souls). Of course, this doesn't mean we have the perfect (souls-like) game.There are lots of different classes and you can switch freely among them since (in contrast to DS) you don't need to select a specific attribute when leveling up -- your stats simply depend on your level and your class.There are heavy tanky classes, swift classes, different melee styles, ranged weapons, magic, etc., and lots of abilities. You can almost combine them arbitrarily, which makes your set very customizable.Then, there are NPC partners. You can turn them off; and I think having a partner or not is basically ""souls-easy-mode"" vs. ""souls-hard-mode"". Since it is possible to explore the areas without a partner, you have the choice. Still, I think that this concept should have been balanced better. Nevertheless: good game; don't buy the DLCs.			"

YOU GET TO CREATE WAIFU/HUSBAND!!! It's the main reason I bought the game. Overall game play is great the enemies will irrate you like no tomorrow BUT youll be able to beat them and be satisfied even tho you died and rage quit for 2 days.			"
Recommended,140.9,"																A lot of people have probably put reviews up describing the character creation, so I'll be skipping over that for the most part.On character creation, it's pretty customizable. You're locked into a few outfits, but mods can change that for your own view. Add ridiculous stuff to your character or tweak minute details to get the perfect look. Your mouth is still not going to move though (even if you pull the mask off with mods).Combat is HEAVILY skewed towards 2H swords. Recent updates have made bayonets a lot better, but 2H swords are still king. This is due to how good blocking is and how high their stagger values are. On higher NG+ counts, stagger is basically the only reason you're killing stuff without getting countered, unless you're always aiming for backstabs. ""Fat rolling"" in this game is a lot more effective than having ""slow"" written for mobility would suggest. With proper timing, you can roll through almost anything. For anything you can't, there's Shifting Hollows.Bayonet gameplay allows a lot of ""cheese"" tactics for anything that's not a boss. The proper combination of Gifts (buffs/spells) and gun can kill pretty much everything that's not a miniboss in one hit, even on NG+. With the new DLC Gifts, you can even do it for free if you're okay with standing around for a minute waiting for ichor to regen. In some boss battles, it feels like they're too resistant to bullets to warrant how much ichor it costs. Also, the bullets fly like molassses on flat concrete, so you're very likely to miss even moderately fast bosses. Add on to that the fact that you have to stop moving to take a shot, and it has a lot of downsides. At least Fusilade Rondo isn't garbage any more, so you can rely on that for your damage.Mage gameplay boils down to backstabbing and one-shotting. Blood Veils (armor) that focus on enhancing Gift damage are fairly light on protection. Speaking of light, attack Light Gifts got neutered and Dark Gifts are basically the only way to go unless something changed again. The typical mage will run at easy enemies to backstab them for ichor (like MP) gain, then one-shot anything troublesome with the appropriate spell. The alternative to this is half-half melee-mage. It works but you're at a pretty big risk in terms of how much damage you can take.Off combat, the story is very ""anime"". Everybody is very clearly on the side that either hurts people or doesn't. There is a tie-in with God Eater that comes up in the latter half of the story, and the DLC bosses are all Aragami, so that's a thing. Memory sequences are forced walking films that honestly would've been just the same if I didn't have to push the thumbstick and stuff just flashed by, which one of them in particular did have. There are 3 available endings which are significantly different. There is one variation on an ending which is based on how many of the Eos vestiges you restored but is exactly the same save for one voice line.Owing to the linear nature of the plot, there is no alternate pathing through the game's different areas. Exploration is essentially going in a circle in a sub-section of the map to pick up extra items. A lot of people will absolutely abhor Cathedral of the Sacred Blood because it's a literal maze and every single building has the same textures. Crypt Spire is also very similar, but a little darker and with a lot less maze.On the DLC, they're not worth the money at all unless you really have that much to throw away. I beat them a handful of times each and then couldn't be bothered. It's just another Depths map with a different color scheme. Nice scam.tl;dr: Recommended but don't buy the DLC.			"

Recommended,14.6,"																This game is fun and souls like but has its own flair to make it unique. Combat is fluid with variant weapons, armors, and abilities. The enemies will punish you if your stupid but they are bland and dont really stand out but still fun to kill all the same. My only really big complaint is getting stuck in the menu when your trying to receive gifts from your companions it only happens when im in the menu for too long.			"
Recommended,44.6,"																As a Souls series veteran, I was extremely excited for Code Vein. The thing about the Souls series is that there's it's sort of in a class of it's own. Which brings me back to Code Vein, it's surprisingly similar yet different from dark souls. The combat style is amazing, somewhat similar to the fast paced action in Bloodborne and Sekiro. The story line seems amazing, with a little less ambiguity as compared to other souls games. It seems like a great game to introduce someone to the Souls series.			"

Recommended,37.3,"																Good game, has a good main story with decent replayability to get all the blood codes and endings. Right now, the deluxe edition is on sale so I suggest getting it to get the extra Astrea blood code, alternate Mia, and DLCs. Although the DLCs are a bit lackluster in terms of content, you get a decent amount of weaponry, blood veils, and blood codes from it; some of which are better than the base game counterparts. The bosses from these games also have a few allusions to other games, namely God Eater, if you're a fan of those games too.In regards to difficulty, I would compare it to the similar playing souls-like games if playing without a companion solo. With a companion, it's easier to an extent, granted you know how to pick up dodging and memorizing boss mechanics. In tangent to companions, multiplayer co-op makes this easier as well, if your summon can also make use of their revive skills for you and vice versa. Do note that difficulty doesn't scale up with number of members in the instance, or at least minimally and barely noticeable, but they still hold their own even without the scaling. Additionally, if you get a ""cancelling distress signal"" error when trying to join other players, there's a bug where you'll have to unequip all gifts and skills on other blood codes you aren't using, then it'll work (stupid, yes I know).For those achievement hunters, a word to the wise regarding ng+ enhanced difficulty: the hp and damage of enemies are scaled exponentially and harder to kill to the point where they one shot if you don't play it safe. Recommendation is to get all your upgrade materials and upgrade your weapons prior to going to NG+. I also recommend backing up a save while you're on NG in case you wanted to grind endings. One of the achievements requires you to farm for 400 co-op tokens as well, so be ready to either grind it out with a friend or farm a certain endgame location for them over and over (I'm actually working on these myself right now).Additionally, the character customization is absolutely great, you can modify just about anything for your character. It's not as in-depth as black desert online's customization but it has a lot of features.I also recommend bringing a controller to play this game as it'll make your life much easier. As with any souls-like games controller is the preferred method for me at least.Aside from that, the game is great, I definitely recommend getting it while it's on sale as it has a great story (it can get a bit confusing at times though).

Recommended,46.1,"																This game is good Ive absolutely had a fun time with this game. This story has the same old anime cliche where: FRIENDSHIP OVERTAKES ALLThis game is ofc hard, most enemies will really mess you up if you're not careful The Cliffs will mess you up really hard, if you're not looking where you're going Surprisingly this game has really good and fleshed out side charactersThe gameplay is actually not that bad either, just make sure TO LOCK ON TARGET I sometimes make the mistake of using my gifts when not facing enemies and miss LOL I was absolutely surprised on how the bosses were actually pretty unique and cool looking While going through the story i was surprised that i actually ended up caring about the characters, and don't even get me started.. THE AI OF THE PARTNERS ARE PRETTY GOOD I cannot tell you how many times my partners had saved my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ass in this game. They're excellent but obviously don't expect them to save you every single time, doesn't work like that.I find myself trying to save them whenever they fall in battle as well despite they're npcs and side characters.Alot of people dislike the partners talking alot, theres an option to turn that off if you're incredibly annoyed. Personally for me though, i didn't mind them talking. The only person i thought was annoying when talking was definitely Eo.Surprisingly this game has a good story to it and that it's not that much of a cliche ass story and its rather unique, such as  a science experiment gone wrong This game is really beautiful and im glad that the hot springs place is the place you can view your cutscenes againAlso i'm surprised how even some of the weapons in the game have unique aspects to them, for example, theres a sword that is dropped by one of the bosses.. and you are able to unleash an ice attack from the sword if you press the Y/Triangle button of the controller. Definitely gotta look out for the weapons that have these elements to them. This game has three endings, and i can tell you... THE TRUE ENDING IS SATISFYING SO AIM FOR THAT(Look at guides man)  Most guides that i looked at are ♥♥♥♥♥♥I'll put a good guide  HERE [gamefaqs.gamespot.com] Another thing to mention, i have no idea how people can finish this game in 24 hours.. my first playthrough i beat it in 50 hours do yourself a favor and don't rush this game.. Cons/Disappointments/Nitpicks: Some problems i had with this game is the fact that the DLC is NOT worth it Im disappointed that with the DLC, doesn't add anything special. OK recolor of a coat OK.. Not interestedI kinda was expecting the trials to be added as achievements instead of another way of adding more customization stuff, thats meh. Be warned, when you restore vestiges or go through the side character's stories. IT'S A WALKING SIMULATOR. Alot of people were annoyed by this, personally i wasn't though, but just warning if you don't like that sort of stuff. (IT'S CRUCIAL TO THE TRUE ENDING BTW, SO YOU GOTTA DO IT) I'm disappointed with how the multiplayer is really.. you and your friend must have NOT beaten the boss in the area for you to play with each other. You could at least add more handicaps to both players.. It's rather annoying how i have to help friends beat the boss on their playthrough, but HAVE TO GO BACK TO MINE. To beat the map again. In my honest opinion this game is worth full pricejust don't buy the dlc, they're crapi made the mistake of buying the deluxe version when the game was going to come out.			"
Recommended,31.2,"																i really love this game , amazing graphics,  beautiful musics,  the character making also very good , i can only recommend this game.			"
Recommended,203.1,"																It was fun in the beginning but there is a few bosses in this game and the locations was not that good and most important the ending was the worst ending you will ever see in a video game			"
Recommended,93.1,"																Not a bad game but has glaring flaws that make it difficult to recommend if you're not already a fan of other games like it. If Bloodborne is a game about aggression and Dark Souls a game about patience, Code Vein is a game about trial and error. Most bosses have at least one move that will instantly kill you, one move that has no wind up animation, and a larger healthbar than you'd expect. This means they're more annoying than most other souls like bosses because if you don't immediately recognize the pattern they're using, they'll one-shot you and you have to run back to the fight.But wait! This problem can be easily mitigated with the partner characters you can bring with you and that's... actually the next biggest problem with the game. Your partners are always around 10x stronger than you are at any given time so they can tank things you can't and will revive you if you go down. This is actually terrible for the game because the partner characters completely trivialize combat. It gets so bad that you can just face-rush some bosses until they die because your partner will always heal you back up. The same goes for the normal enemies too, with your partner unflinchingly carving a path through anything around them and you looking like a fancy support. The game is clearly designed to be played with a partner at all times, which is a shame because the partner makes it too easy.Besides bosses, some enemies just seem to be in the game to annoy you. Red enemies without weapons are some of the more bonkers enemies in the game because they have an instant attack that does good damage, a chain kick that can stunlock you through the whole combo, and a long range kick that deals around 90% of your hp if you're at the appropriate level. Again, this isn't hard to deal with if you've got a partner but solo this is just isn't fun.Besides enemies, the levels can get bland and the Cathedral just needs to not (you'll know what I mean).But with all of that said, I still like the game. I don't love it but it's worth a play if you like the genre. It's got a pretty snappy melee system and my favorite magic system of any soulslike game. The character customization is great and the story's serviceable. Play it if you like other soulslike games and don't mind some mediocre boss fights.			"

Boss fights are dynamic and quite hard, but easy if you can play well the game (OSTs are awesome, i loved them)If you play this game like a souls game (looking for the Lore of the game, reading descriptions, not rushing locations, playing every Depths, etc) it can be very longeval (i completed the main game and almost the first DLC in 50 hours).Overall, the game is good. Your first run is going to be awesome if you play it well. Have fun in the mist ;)			"
Recommended,19.1,"																It's like if someone played Dark Souls and was like, ""You know what this game needs? Big titty anime girls!"" It cribs VERY heavily from DS environments and bosses. At least the boss in the lava area isn't the Bed of Chaos. The character customization is expansive and the character progression is an interesting bit of mix-and-match abilities from different 'Blood Codes' (aka Classes). It's not a bad game, but you should probably exhaust your supply of souls-likes before picking this up. Of course, if you hate souls-likes, don't even bother.			"
Recommended,43.3,"																Yup its anime Dark Souls.I really enjoyed the setting and the character customization is amazingly in-depth. Really refreshing after all those other games that make you pay for cosmetics. The story was pretty good, not amazing but with the voice actors they got (I had Japanese audio) it was well done. I did feel this game was a little too easy. I put off leveling up to make the game more challenging, but still had little trouble except for three bosses. The combat was solid, cool skills/spells/strategies, definitely rivals Dark Souls combat.So should you get it? Short answer: Yes if on sale. Long answer: The game has little replayability. Getting different endings doesn't change the gameplay experience and being able to switch Blood Codes (Character class) lowers it further. I'm glad they allow for switching Blood Codes, as it keeps the combat interesting learning new skills/style, but part of what brings players back is making different builds. If you've been experimenting your whole playthrough, you've seen everything. Basically if you're considering buying this, you will most likely only do a single playthrough. BUT that single playthrough is worth doing! For the right price.			"
Recommended,27.9,"																I really love this game as a whole. While I haven't played it on PC till now. I have played it constantly on PS4. What do I like about it? Well, listed in order of my favorite to least favorite features, I'd have to say them in the following order;Graphics Wise: I really like the Graphics as a whole. They somewhat remind me of ""Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet's"" ""SBC Glocken"" map in a lot of ways. Their ""Remnant Wasteland"" map too. As well as their dungeons, and the ""SBC Flügel"" map. Yet, this includes the ""Forgotten Forest"" map, and type of vibe I get from it. The terrain reminds me of their ""Solitary Sands"" map. Honestly, it reminds me of all the maps in ""Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet."" Each bit of the graphics remind me of ""Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet,"" but it especially reminds me of the map ""Old South,"" mostly in a visual sense, rather than the feeling I get from it. The other maps are more just, a feeling I get from it, rather than visually in my personal opinion. Then, the ""Winter Frontier"" map is the one that reminds me most from the feeling I get from it.When it comes to exactly how I'm reminded to these maps, the ways are a bit difficult to explain, but I'll attempt to do so. Solitary Sands, some bits really just feel desolate, just like Solitary Sands does. Concerning the dungeon, SBC Glocken, and ""The SBC Flügel,"" it's just the building in them really that remind me of ""Code VEIN."" Forgotten Woods, well it just feels eerie too me, same with the map ""Winter Frontier,"" but, in the case of this map. I'm reminded of it since it also feels tense to me. Maybe this is because I usually go there with a vastly lower level character than recommended to get better drops, and level, yet also to just enjoy myself from a challenge.Each bit of the game feels like it puts a unique spin on those aforementioned maps. It then blends all of those maps together into one, yet keeps the feel of them. Even enhancing the map further. Then they go and give the game it's very own features. I hope that was a good way to describe the graphics, I'm not sure though. Please do let me know your opinion down below.When it comes to the character models, I feel it's reminiscent of ""Black Desert Online,"" but a bit less detail oriented, so to speak. Yet still very broad. In such a degree that. I don't think that I know any other games besides ""Black Desert"" and ""Code VEIN,"" especially not with this level of quality. Overall, without getting into too much detail, I absolutely can't stop playing this game. It's addicting.Combat: It really reminds me of both ""Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2"" and ""Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet,"" in two, very distinct ways. In the case of ""Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet,"" it is how it just feels. It feels smooth and fluid, just like how this game feels to me, yet it feels just as just as flexible, if not even more flexible, as ""Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2"" feels to me, when it concerns combos that is. It's also just as addicting as ""Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2"" combat is too me, even more so really.Game play: In general, the game play feels fast paced, yet drawn out. Fluid and flexible, as well as addicting. In-game interactions give me the same feeling, this whole game does.While I may not be the best at describing things, I hope this was effective. I don't generally review games at all, in fact this is only the 3rd review I've published, ever. So, I hope I stayed on track and explained things in an effective manner. I also hope that the comparisons really helped despite how vague they are, or how little it might have been. This also happens to be the only game I've ever recommended.I'd really recommend this game to anyone who wants to check it out, even if you only want to check it out due to the graphics. I doubt it will disappoint at all. I personally enjoy the combat bit the most, but I also appreciate the graphics to a large degree. I tried to keep this as short, and as brief as I could conceivably attempt to. I hope you enjoyed this(for those who actually looked through this. Lol). I had a lot of fun writing it, now I go back to playing!			"

Recommended,48.7,"																I play Code Vein since release and even if I might not play that much rn, I still found a few good and bad things. The following things are criticism and not meant to be insulting. I think Code Vein is a great game with a really good story and a good feeling gameplay with a not too hard but still challenging difficulty. I only have a few things that I hate because they are just making the game really annoying sometimes. Like the Targetting system: It heappens all the time, that I target an enemy and like dash back out of range to heal and then look at another enemy and it automaticly switches the targetting. (I couldn't find a Option to change that and auto targetting after killing a enemy is disabeled as well) which is really annoying as I like to manage the targetting myself and I sometimes even die because I can't attack the right enemy or because I look in a completely different direction. I mean. Yeah, you get used to it but in fights where you fight 2 bosses it just makes me die A LOT because of the things I mentioned.The multiplayer:Also the Multiplayer is made bad when you're looking forward to get the Achievment that wants you to reach reputation 30 (helping others 400 times) because it doesn't give you anything when you help them get a mistle or defeat the wave events or just help them a long time. I literally already helped people getting trought the full second half of the Cathedral multiple times today and because they go to the memories I get kicked without any rewards. Like Wtf. I spend like 20-30 minutes helping someone, getting trough all of that crap and then I get no reward. And as most of the few people I find are in the cathedral (I still help them) I never get a reward for helping people all the time. You also can't rest which is ok but even when they do because they notice that a boss is comming I don't get a reward AGAIN. That way I will spend ages to get the Achievment and half of the time will be without a reward. You also have to beat two bosses when your at the final boss because they count as one even tho there is a cutscene between them and they are completely different.Ok enough bad things time for some good things. The ""Team mates"". I think that the KI for IO, Yakumo and all the others isn't bad at all (from what I've experienced) and they make the game way more enjoyable sometimes when you're just looking to play chilled without having to concentrade too much and not for the solo running while you have to beat everyone alone and have to watch out more. Every ""Team mate"" is also good in their own ways and I never thought like ""Ugh, I don't want to play with that companion, they are just too weak or literally like the others.""Also the grafic and the music/ the design in general. It is beatyful for the eye and for the ear. It's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played and the story keeps carrying me away. I sometimes find myself just standing somewhere enjoying the view and/or the atmosphere.The Abilities:I think the abilities are really good too because they are not all the same and there is a great amount to choose from. Even tho I havn't played every bloodcode I still see how much different things there are even if a few things are simmilar.I Could go on like that for ages but nobody would read that (That's what I'm telling myself because I am too lazy to go on)(why would anyone read my comment anyways? are you crazy xD) Anyways. I would DEFINETLY recommend playing Code Vein at least once and just enjoy the story and the gameplay. But if you want to complete every achievment you're in for a lot of hours into the game. I hope my comment was helpfull... bye                                                                                                                                                               -A Weeb			"

Recommended,50.5,"																The controls on the keyboard are pretty confusing when you're learning them for the first time - I have no idea if these types of games all have the same mechanics, but it was definitely a learning curve to get used to, at least in terms of using those special skills and needing to press Shift + 1 + whatever F key you need. Sometimes there'll suddenly be a very short cut scene of my character doing some kind of ultimate in the middle of combat and I have no clue how it's triggered still. I'm not heavily into gaming though, so if you're like me you should probably keep that in mind.In terms of the story, it's a little confusing to follow along - I put the language on Japanese with subtitles though, so I might just be slow on the uptake. The characters are alright. A lot of big boobies to make up for the lack of personalities. All in all, it's just a fun game to play after work. The art style (or whatever you call it) is cool and there's a lot of interesting things to look at and find to keep yourself busy, and I really like the grindy-ness of it all.			"

Not too grindy so don't worry.The maps are sometimes tricky and annoying but once you get used to it, it's not that difficult.Things I don't like: 1. Since this game is anime-like, of course there are gonna be some fan services which I found some too much or skimpy(but not all character)2.

Recommended,161.2,"																 Waifu/Husbando Genera--I mean, Code Vein! A hidden gem for me as I knew nothing about this game until a video about it popped up in my YouTube recommendations, sparking my interest in playing it. The 91 hours I have on record at the time of this review are actually 74+ hours for me to complete my first playthrough and the rest was me fooling around in the character creation menu because of how rich it is.A lot of people categorize it as a Souls-like, and rightfully so, as it employs a lot of similar gameplay elements. While I haven't played any Souls-like games before this one, I have seen enough content of Bloodborne, Sekiro and the likes to be able to see the similarities for myself. But I think the people who criticize that aspect of the game (because of the ""Discount Anor Londo"" or the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer boss fight, which are really only superficial similarities when you think about it) exaggerate it WAY too much, just in the same way some people reduce Sekiro to ""Dark Souls, but you play a samurai"". Code Vein isn't so much an anime clone of Dark Souls than it is a JRPG that uses Souls-like gameplay mechanics.Pros:- Nervous reflex-based combat that will keep you on edge. Not ""Press X to win"" in any way.- Challenging boss fights that encourage you to use different tactics and learn from your mistakes.- The different Blood Codes, Blood Veils and weapons you can obtain in the game offer staggering diversity in playstyles, and you can change your build on the fly. There is not one build that will let you auto-win every single battle, but neither can bosses be beat with any build you want.- Intriguing lore that doesn't answer all questions about the world of Vein, but reveals just enough to keep you invested in the story and universe.- One of the richest and most detailed character customization systems you will find in a game. Bonus points if you're into anime.- While I played the game with the Japanese dub, what I saw from the English dub is more than decent for a localized game.Cons:- The STR stat is extremely unbalanced.- The breast jiggle physics on the more... endowed female characters and enemies are straight-up ridiculous, Coco and Io in particular. It isn't distracting so much because of how large they are, but because of how unrealistic it looks. Talking to Coco from a certain angle (while she's not leaning against her car) will cause her to turn around and her bazongas to bounce all over the place. You may find it funny at first, but over time, it becomes really obnoxious.Overall Appreciation:  8/10 			"
Recommended,56.3,"																Pros:-Fantastic original story with plenty of lore and character relationships-Great visuals, artwork and music-Souls-like level of challengeCons:-Like other souls-like games it can be very tedious at times-Certain levels and parts of the story were incredibly dragged outOverall, worth playing. The story, characters and worlds are so well designed. While it may seem long and a bit annoying at times it's worth it at least for a single play-through.			"

Recommended,29.6,"																At the time of this review i have played the story mode 4 times without increasing the difficulty.Pros:-Character Customization has a crazy amount of stuff you can do, but has slight limitations to body proportions. Taking an hour to go through customization isn't a exaggeration. Plenty of waifus/husbandos you can make if that's your thing.-Interesting world and setting.-Unique abilities and combat system. You aren't tied to a single ""class"", so you can play multiple playstyles.-Frequent updates. game fixes, balances, and content updates.Cons:-No pvp. i feel like pvp is needed for the longevity of games like this.-Some co-op things need to be changed, which they will likely fix. (i'm looking at you, marks of honor)-story mode felt a bit short imo, without upping the difficulty it took me about 7 hours on my first playthough and 5.5 hours on my second with a slight power increase.-story had a lot of cheesy melodrama, and i wish the backstories were more fleshed out.-certain parts of the combat/ability system aren't intuitive, such as weapon/blood veil scaling and proficiency.Summary:A souls-like game with an anime twist. Amazing character customization and anime style sets it apart from similar games. The ability system is unique and varied, but isn't the easiest to understand at first. The World and setting are very interesting, however parts of the story are somewhat lacking.Overall: 7/10Would recommend this game, but $60 is a bit pricey for the current amount of content			"

Not Recommended,27.8,"																It's Dark Souls, but more casual and has anime babes. Graphic is amazing and each characters have various degree of depth, making them feels more like characters than just an NPC that gives you quests. The Japanese voice acting are also superb. Action is toned down Dark Souls. Boss fight can be done relatively quick, depending on your build. Character customization is decent. I wish for more outfits though.			"

The player character can sit and lay down on multiple furniture around the home base, and will eventually fall asleep if left idle. Please think of your videogame protagonists and let them have their sleep, too!The Fact of the MattaA surprise smash-hit for myself. On the surface it is a souls-like that drinks deep of the image of the traditional vampire, features a buddy system as a core gameplay element (but can be played solo), and has an incredibly powerful character creator to boot. Underneath is a challenging and refreshing take on the genre, paired with a narrative that was pleasantly surprising and enjoyable throughout. Strongly recommended for souls-like fans who want something a little different, and anyone who is interested by what the game offers but are unfamiliar with the genre.			"

Recommended,6.2,"																More than just another souls-like. Story is less cryptic; solid with a likable cast of characters. The skill system in the game is akin to FF Tactics games where you can master abilities making them usable on other classes. Having an NPC companion to travel around with is a nice change from the traditional souls experience as they have more personality and many of the encounters feel as if they're balanced around it.			"
Recommended,126.4,"																Very good souls-like game.its like Dark Souls but anime styled.story is good, vampires seeking survival. typical JRPG themed story where a person makes a big accident and all of a sudden everyone loses their memories.gameplay is somewhat DarkSouls but easier. you fight, collect haze (souls) and checkpoints are from plants. and when you die, all your haze will drop form where you last left it.Mulltiplayer is kinda meh, but playable. 1 person only, by firing an sos signal and a player joins. but servers are either really rare, or the players, but sos ing takes a really long time.good companion system. new update can make the companion quiet if you want. lots of companions with their respectable classes can be chosen from, each with their own support and play style. but going without a companion is available too.controls are good and need good reflexes. one mistake or missed moment and boom, ur dead. ive been playing with a gamepad controller and its amazing. kinda hard using keyboard though.graphics are beautiful. even though its anime themed, the shading, post procesisng and lights, combined with the effects and particles makes it look really beautiful.overall, 9/10 very good, highly recommended, just hard for those not into it.

Recommended,27.2,"																Recommend 'Yes': as a standalone game and on saleRecommend 'No': as a soulsborne comparison and full priceThe difficulty is decent (varies sometimes quite strongly). The combat is fine. The story is alright tho nothing really special. The japanese voice acting is very nice. (recommended!)The maps are complete ♥♥♥♥ (except for the last area). The character creation is the best thing I have ever seen. (you can change your appearance in the game for free and have lots of badass/moodfitting 'loadouts')The bosses are very mixed, some are really good and interesting and others are just a waste of time (alot of them lack the 'epicness'). The music is pretty good, not perfect but good.The anime aspect of the game is definetly present (in good and bad ways).Way to many cutscenes, sure you can skip'em but well... I do wanna know what happens and see some boobs jiggling.The companion 'system' is pretty good, you can decide who you want to take with you or if you want to go alone (the game is ALOT easier with a npc so try to play it solo first).The online COOP works I guess. Havent really tried it.			"
Recommended,11.1,"																Everything in this game takes a while to get up to speed, but once it does its great.  The combat drastically improves as you unlock new skills that allow you to experiment.The level design becomes much more interesting by the 3rd zone.The color pallet expands past ruined city pallet after a few zones.The dumbass, idealistic anime bros that follow you around eventually warmed my cold heart.This game is primarily story driven, yet you're thrown into a strange world with amnesia and a ton of Jargon to sort through. Most of the gaps in the lore are filled in through anime backstory flashbacks. The core gameplay loop eventually becomes Explore Zone->Fight Boss-> Unlock/complete side content-> Explore next zone. This becomes quite satisfying/self reinforcing as you become stronger, more well equipped and more attached to the growing supporting cast with each cycle of the loop.			"

The graphics are beautiful and immersive. The game mechanics will take some time to understand and get used to, but this allows for great diversity for different play styles. The game allows for companions which comes in handy for new players, but if you're masochistic you can go it alone. Overall I give it an 9/10. Word of warning: Prepare to die. Again.			"
Recommended,94,"																As a souls game veteran and long time rpg fan, this is a game I definitely appreciate playing. I don't find it as challenging as a From Software title but it still scratches the itch of games such as Bloodborne, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Nioh, and Dark Souls. The different ways you can customize is what I've found unique about this game and actually having a story line that doesn't require you to read the lore is great for beginners who want to jump into this style of game and actually have a sense of purpose as they progress without having to do too much digging.

Recommended,183.5,"																2 playthroughs completed and forty hours later, I feel like jotting down a few thoughts about the game. To start, I bought Code Vein because I had a souls-like itch that my 321st runthrough of Dark Souls (only a slight exaggeration) couldn't quite scratch. It was on sale, it had positive reviews (like this one is about to be) and I decided to buy it. And, yeah, it's good. Not great, but quite good.The gameplay is far and away the best part. It rips off souls, which I haven't the slightest problem with, and sprinkles in some Dragon's Dogma with its gift system. These are either passive or active unlocks that can be obtained through a myriad of different classes, encouraging some experimentation. The overall effect of this system is a really solid  souls-like combat system that branches away enough so it didn't feel stale. I thought games like Nioh or Sekiro brought more overall variety to the classic formula, but this game accomplishes enough for it to feel fresh while maintaining the overall structure of the best gameplay experience of the decade.If you mostly care about gameplay, like me, feel free to stop reading here and either buy it or wait for a sale. Everything else works well enough around that core aspect to make the experience enjoyable. For everyone else, I'll give a brief overview. The setting and world design is good not great, areas have enough variety but get repetitive within the level. The ice level is ice, the fire level is fire, the cathedral level is too long... and also a cathedral level. Not much changes within the environments. Dark souls did something really cool where it placed you into what felt like a once lived in world. Nothing about this will give that same feeling. Its pretty enough to get by, but it shouldn't earn any exceptional marks here.The story too is fine. I don't want to go too in depth, but overall it's a compelling enough tale. The grand plot can be a little... cheesy? Perhaps a little too much anime, but at the individual character level there's a lot to like. There are three endings, which are almost objectively bad, neutral, and good. It's a somewhat arbitrary split in how they do it, but it works well enough. One of the reasons I played it through twice is I messed one thing up and got the wrong ending. Not that I minded all that much.Music is good. I'm far from an expert, so I don't have much to say there. It works, there are some nice songs. Thumbs up. The game runs and looks fine. It sometimes looks great, othertimes only okay. It might depend on whether you like the art direction, which I mostly did. Overall, a very good game with a strong central combat system that's built around well enough. 8/10			"
Recommended,79.1,"																Anime to all hell but much better then expected and a blast with friends			"
Recommended,67,"																A very fair and balanced game with a simple formula and rewarding gameplay. Also tiddies.			"
Recommended,7.6,"																This is without a doubt, Anime Dark Souls.and it is Goooooooooooooooood~though it has a lot of different mechanics that separates it enough from being a simple dark souls clone but with big anime tiddies.for one, there's a minimap! and you can bring around one AI companion with you. and they'll help from time to time, but don't expect them to solo any bosses for you.sadly code vein is currently lacking in the online multiplayer department. i'm not really sure if it's just my connection or what, but in my almost 50 hours of gameplay, i've only managed to find one person on the distress signal. and no one ever came to me when i sent a distress signal for my bosses.That being said, the game is still a work of art. story rich and characters that you'll grow to like. it has all the ingredients of being a game of the year.

BTW, Thanks for the good times Yakumo, you over powered bot, love ya bro! LUL			"
Recommended,13.7,"																So, I never liked or even watched anime before playing this, and I still don't really call myself an anime person. I liked Darksouls and I didn't mind anime, and if you like Darksouls or like really interesting stories with characters that you care so much for regardless of if you like anime or not, I strongly recommend you to play this game.I still don't watch anime or anything with anime, this is really the only thing that is close to anime that I have liked. The story made me not care about the anime and I just got on and learned to like the game for the story and the gameplay.DEVELOPERS [please read lol its a suggestion that I think everyone will like]: (The only thing I would love for the DEVELOPERS to add into the game is maybe when you finish the game is give you the ability to have certain character's clothing (including Blood Veils) with accessories. What I mean by this is that it seems unfair for to get Io's weapon but not her Mask or her bloodveil or clothes with it too, so maybe at the end of the game just give the ability for every character's clothes or blood veils that we get close with. Or just any way to get them like giving valuables and then like how you get Io's weapon but instead you get her blood veil and weapon. It would just seem nicer to take the clothes of some of the characters we love and apply it to our own. Personally I'm a Io ""fan"" and to make this short it'd be nice to have her things such as her Blood veil, accessories along with her weapon, because it just feels wrong to have the weapon on its own and not the full 'set'. And maybe in the customisation screen allow us to have the metal things she has on her fingers along with her mask, etc etc you get it I'll stop here, [[[also maybe a 'story' dlc where you can play as a character to get their backstory, such as a dlc of Louis before he finds you, or a Io story for her to find the player like the beginning, just a thought.]]]). Listen, I love this game, I've been playing it for a few days and it took a few days to just finish the 'campaign missions' (just getting to the end, there are no missions this is just like darksouls, just the story is a lot more clearer in my opinion). And it is worth the price if you are a darksouls lover too.Anyway, thanks for reading, and I hope you get the game too so maybe we could play together, (already forcing a friend of mine to buy the game haha).

Recommended,137.2,"																I'm not much of a Souls type game fan, so games of the same genre generally drive me away. However I decided to give Code Vein a try, and I'm really glad I did. For all of the souls games that are out there, I'd put my money on Code Vein for being one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite game of my life. The game has so much good potential, and has been easily for me, an enjoyable experience for me and my friend.==========================================Pros:+ Rich character creator, with plenty of choices such as voices, hair styles, and accessories to choose from.+ Excellent story telling with plenty of endings.+ An amazing soundtrack, with lots of different music that fits with the game's feel.+ Memorable characters with their own background stories.+ Unique combat elements utilizing the game's main element of ""Blood Codes""+ Different areas and bring the game together and make it whole.+ Amazing graphics.+ Level design is on point, with different areas themed on ruined cities, barren wastes, fitting with the game's theme of a world in chaos.+ Excellent voice acting for all the main characters you come across, and even for the unique NPCs that are rarely seen.+ Co-Op works really well.Cons:- Co-Op is very limited, with features such as photo mode not being able to be used in Co-Op sessions, even though there are emotes that are themed towards a group, and there are no PvP based rooms where you and a friend or random player can test each other in a battle.- The game has a few bugs, however nothing game breaking.- Cutscenes are not replayable, so accidently skipping one means you'd have to either re-watch the cutscene online, or replay the part you just beat.==========================================Code Vein has become one of my favorite games, with only having it for about 59 hours of playtime at the time of making this review. It really does have a unique feel, rather than being a knock-off cash grab of a souls game. There are some things I do wish were changed, most that are Co-Op based, but overall, Code Vein is a game that I feel anyone can pick up and play, but not be able to master without time and patience, since the game has lots of difficult bosses and unique enemies. Personally, I'd have to rate the game a 9.4/10. If you are looking for a souls game to try, I would honestly recommend playing Weeb Souls (Code Vein).			"
Recommended,133.5,"																I have played every souls game, Bloodbourne, and Sekiro. I can say this proudly that this game does not have as much of a challenge as those games (The challenge is still there don't worry) but what this game lacks in that respect is the amazing story.  As soon as I played the demo I was instantly pulled into the story. I love the characters, the world, and the entire universe that this game takes place in. It makes me love the game even more to know that I don't have to play through questioning what the hell is going on like you do in the souls games. This game is 110% worth every penny.			"

Recommended,198.1,"																It's an anime Dark Souls. Gameplay reflects this. Neat ability system. Story is told in a way that allows someone who wouldn't necessarily be reading all of the descriptions on items -- like they would have to in a Souls game -- to get meaningful backstory about characters and the overall story.  Level design is linear and unthoughtful. Would buy this game only if it's on sale. It's definitely fun though.			"
Recommended,31.3,"																Love the art style and the combat leaves a lot variety for any wanted play style. The options aren't overwhelming if you are into different forms of combat to adapt to each new area and enemy. There are some zones where using one form and switching when you get to a boss is actually supported. The souls like game is a fresh take on a already great genre. My only dislike is how transparent the story is. But that's coming from someone who loves the Dark Souls lore and how you have to figure it out on your own. But that being said the story isn't bad, in fact I found me playing more wanting to know what was going to happen next. Overall great game!			"

A perfect blend of challenge and accessibility; with the option on ng+ To choose the difficulty in crease and or keep it at the same level. Hyde's music, and the banger soundtrack add to the ambience of the vampire dystopia that you live in. It's one of my top 10 games of 2019 and worth every cent.			"
Recommended,58,"																TL; DR: a Souls-like game for newcomers and veterans of the genre.Dark Souls, only with waifus and a story easier to understand. Ok, jokes aside, it's a very good game on its own merit! If you like Souls-like games, you should give this one a try. And if you're a newcomer to the genre, the game is easier than DS thanks to the Partner mechanic, which gives the player a AI companion. And should you want to play alone, without AI or a Coop friend, you can do it whenever you like.			"

Many different abilities to mix with your play style add to the typical DS formula but you can ignore it entirely. It may lack the polish of dark souls series and characters suffer from some serious anime tropes but they make up for it with constant free updates which could be easily sold as small dlcs by some other company.It's a rather simple game with a lot of small things that make it worthwhile.

Recommended,14.8,"																""I definitely enjoyed this. I just wanted to be a cool character and do cool ♥♥♥♥ in this cool world, and that is literally exactly what I got. So I'm very happy with that"" - ValkyrieAuroraI'm a very big fan of the Souls games and games like them. For some people it's the difficulty, for others it can be the worlds or lore. For me, and probably most others, Souls like games almost always have a setting that you just want to be immersed in. I just want to have my personal character (who I would probably make a story for) and just explore the world, kick some ass and meet interesting characters. In my opinion, it checked every mark for me.The Character Creator is fantastic and there are plenty of options. With some creativity, effort and time, you can make a variety of beautys or... memetastic abominations! If I had a gripe, the variety of clothing in the creator itself is kind of bare but this can more or less be circumvented with some mods/clever use of accessories. There's also a variety of armor, but they're mostly just chest pieces of various types.Combat is just nearly like any Dark Souls game, fluid and every hit feels good.... even when your damage isn't the best. The biggest difference would be that weapon arts are replaced with customizable abilities/gifts that you can spend your resource points on to do. If I had a gripe with this area, hitboxes felt a bit off. Backstabbing is easier in this than Souls games but I felt you had to pay attention to your distance just as much as your positioning. If I was too close to the enemy in combat, the back stab wouldn't go off versus if I made sure to leave some distance in between it was major damage galore.Characters and story were very.... anime. Don't get me wrong, I thought they were fantastic and I enjoyed all of it, especially the characters. What I actually mean is... it can be very ""tropey"", especially if you've seen enough anime. It will really come down to if you can just push those thoughts away and just enjoy the story for what it is. The characters... again, if you've seen enough anime you can point out the character archetypes really easily, but they do them rather well and are unique enough to be their own individual so it wasn't hard to just enjoy them as well.  Mia and Io <3 Difficulty compared to the Souls game is actually very noticeable. I'm not a ""pro"" soul player. I don't min-max. I do what looks cool or fun. If you've played enough souls games, you know that usually means just dying a lot. In Code Vein, that mostly means looking stylish as hell while kicking ass. I've made it through bosses without taking damage on the first try without knowing anything about them and just wailing on them mercilessly with a bayonet. The majority of tells on bosses are easy to read and you can just bloodborne your way out of most of the trouble. I think most deaths come from the gank squads dotted around some of the areas, or... the map itself ready to murder you. All in all it's Dark Souls: Anime Waifu/Husbando edition lite. If you're looking for a challenging experience where builds matter and care not for anime waifus or their problems, just rush to the NG+ stuff. If you want to look like Sonic and go fast, murdering everyone in your path with a rifle, you can do that too. I just wanted to make an OC, pretty her up, give her a gun, have an NPC partner who livened things up while adventuring and go to town on every enemy in my path while taking in the story and environments, and I got that. It's a good game, I guarantee it.			"

Recommended,47.2,"																The combat system is fun and the blood codes keep it deep and moving, If you're in it for the difficulty you may come away a bit put off but if you forego the partner system it gets a bit more difficult. All that being said, if you enjoy cheesy anime stories it really delivers and i'm personally a sucker for em. The memories really let you invest in your npcs, and if you sit through the whole story the game takes ages. I personally tried to 100% it a first time through and managed to get there for the most part, and enjoyed every second of it. Worth every penny			"

"
Recommended,38.4,"																As a Dark Souls veteran who just finished my first playthrough, this game was the substitute I was looking for my addiction IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY.The combat feels familiar, weapons do as well, the “Ichor” (magic) and Focused mechanics allows for more usage of special attacks and spells, which were lackluster even in DS3, and the build system the game, which is a completely different thing to its leveling system, never-ever locks you to a specific build. You can, without exaggerating, pretty much go from a nimble spellblade to a bulky warhammer warrior in the middle of a fight. That good it is. And the bossfights, while not exactly memorable, are HARD. If you play alone, with no AI companion, some bosses feel unfair and unbalanced… which also adds more to the challenge you SHOULD be into.Having said that… it IS anime-souls in terms of lore. Anime being the keyword.Expect, I gotta admit (since I’m not into anime), a sufficiently good story, kinda copy-pasted but with anime spice, that’s told through dialogues and cutscenes, which means that all’s given to you to digest right away. It has its moments of mystery and at times it gets a little dark… but then you have cringy overreacted dialogues about the power of friendship and fighting for those you care. So yeah, don’t except to have the same atmosphere of desolation and loneliness that you get on Dark Souls.			"
Recommended,32.7,"																Charcater customization is amazing, i feel guilty saying I bought the game purely for the customization but after playing for a few hours the story now has me captivated and the challenging gameplay keeps me wanting to play. probably the best game of 2019.because of this game being so good i give it 1/10			"
Recommended,66.7,"																If you're looking for something to rise up to what Dark Souls is, Code Vein may not be for you.Code Vein is markedly easier than Dark Souls for a number of reasons - enemies aren't as difficult to deal with, level design is more straightforward, and the invasion PVP aspects that Dark Souls is known for are completely axed. Code Vein is a lighter, strictly co-op Dark Souls, and may gel more with players who tried Dark Souls and didn't find it to their liking due to the invasion mechanics - something I would not blame anyone for.Aesthetically, it's very anime, that much if obvious. Given that Namco Bandai also published the God Eater games, it's a fair comparison to make when I say that they look very similar to one another. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and often looks as ruined and desolate as such a setting would demand. The enemies vary in shape and size, though truth be told the variety in their design is somewhat lacking. What ones are there, though, are a pleasant little menagerie of monstrous foes, and the boss designs are particularly inspired. All in all, the design style is going to be hit or miss, and is likely ""too anime"" for anyone not already a fan of that sort of thing.All in all, it's a solid game with decent writing and storylines behind each character to provide them all with depth - and, unlike Dark Souls, the game does not purposefully obscure its story and lore. It's a nice souls-like game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a lighter experience with the genre.			"

Recommended,58,"																If you like being a vampire this is the game for you, it's more like anime Dark Souls in a sense. If that gives you any idea, I recommend this because I find it to be really fun and challenging to people who haven't played Dark Souls before.			"
Recommended,27.5,"																I have easily over 1000 hours clocked in the souls games. I've plat'd all of them. I hate anime tropes and cliches. And don't get me wrong, a good story is a good story no matter the medium, but this is middle-school-edgy-without-being-the-slight-bit-self-aware trope coupled with the comically-large-breasted-meek-women-calls-you-master cliche. I'm one of the super invested into the Miyazaki's world building types. I tell you all this so you know the perspective I write from for this review -- I think a lot of others might be in a similar boat.Outside of combat, it is a carbon copy of souls. It's got bonfires/homeward bones/dark sign, titanite shards and lightning/fire/etc gems, etcetc. Inside combat it's pretty damn close to souls on paper. Five weapon types, with slight variances within each family. Standard stuff. The only innovation this game offers (and only thing interesting about this part) is how it handles gear and stat allocation. There's still leveling, but all stats are offloaded into gear and specializations you can freely equip. It allows for you to get a taste for more/less everything a character can be, in a single playthrough. I think this actually takes a lot from the connection you can make with your role/character, and the fun of having your sneaky thief or fireball wizard, but I understand I'm likely a minority in this pro-locked in case.There is very little enemy variety in this game. A substantial amount copied, reskin'd, and pasted from zone to zone. There's not much depth to most of them, either. Just press attack until they drop. And since I'm the type of guy who needs to collect (buy) everything, I'm not spending any points on leveling. So it's not like I steamroll through cuz I've been grinding.This game is not amazing. Its very easy, but I think it has some capacity for challenge runs that may be fun to try out. It's insanely cringe-inducing at times with weeb pandering, but the world building is pretty good. Thinking about this game as the Demon Soul's of a new Code Vein series trying to tread water? I can recommend this game. Thinking of this as Anime Souls and trying to rub shoulders with the giants? Hard pass. Overall, considering a 5/10 is an average game, I'd say it's a 3/5. It's enjoyable.-----Changing from an upboat to a downboat. I dunno, I was originally on the line, but having dwelt on it for a good while, this game really isn't worth the time (or the full/currently sale price)			"

Recommended,115.2,"																My ThoughtsWhen I saw the trailer for Code Vein, I was immediately intrigued on buying it. It's basically Dark Souls, but anime. I love the character customization, it may not be very extensive, but it's enough to distinguish between different characters so no one actually looks the same. The combat is also fun, it's a lot easier compared to Dark Souls which is why I'd recommend this game to new players who are getting into souls-like games. However, I expected the graphics to be the same as the trailer. Don't get me wrong, the game still looks nice, but it does look a little stale compared to what I've seen in the trailer. Results could be different depending on PC setup though.I still haven't finish the game yet, but so far the game has been mesmerizing.Buy the game and try it out if you're interested! If it doesn't suit your cup of tea it's always possible to refund the game.			"
Recommended,93.3,"																A ""Souls"" game but with anime-esque graphics. Even if you aren't particularly fond of anime, the game-play itself makes up for it.Note that I have never tried multiplayer and hence will not include this aspect in the review.Story (6/10):Personally, I do think this is the weakest link for the game. The overall premise is interesting, but story feels extremely forced onto the player. I didn't feel a natural sense of progression for the story, but rather a forced transition on pretty much every point in the game, like dues ex machina on auto-play.Characters (8/10):The characters are your standard anime trope lineup. Characters do have personal backstories tied to them, including the non companion NPCs. Personally I didn't feel extremely attached to any of the characters but they weren't annoying either. Your character is pretty much a silent protagonist (other than for screams/groans and probably about 1-2 lines in cinematic). Character customization on the other hand is amazing; it isn't unnecessarily complicated nor too limited. Anyone can easily hop in and design their own character with ease.Gameplay (9/10):Extremely fluid, responsive and fast paced. A lot of variety for different builds and skills. It is entirely possible to solo the game without skills, but it does spike up the difficulty significantly. Boss fights are probably the best part about game, as it should be. Overall boss balancing is slightly questionable in terms of HP as it does seem it was balanced for 2 players (AI companion or another player). I personally found the boss fights to be a cakewalk with just an AI companion though, and hence recommend solo-ing the bosses for the best play experience (save for maybe one duo boss fight). Seriously, don't rob yourself of pretty much the game's strongest point. However, not a 10 because of some very questionable level design in certain areas (a save point that is literally an elevator, ladder and a good 2 minutes of running away from the boss for no conceivable reason).Sound (9/10):Really solid overall. I've never played with English dub so cannot comment on that but Japanese character voices are well done; solid cast lineup.Soundtrack is amazing, especially boss themes; lifts the overall boss fight experience.Overall (8/10):If you're a fan of action RPGs (doesn't strictly have to be a Souls game), this is the game for you. Depending on how you play (with companion, solo, level 1, etc), the game can go from really easy to extremely challenging, which in my opinion is a neat way of introducing varying degree of difficulty to the game rather than just numerical scaling.

Recommended,5.6,"																Anime Souls. While very faithful to the SoulsBorne formula and it's not without it's own twists on it.The biggest change here is the Blood Code system, classes that you can switch on the fly depending on the situation and mood you're in. Gives a lot of gameplay variety and doesn't lock it behind NG+ or respecing. Just open your character window and pick one. Also, if you've mastered a skill from a Blood Code that makes it available in another one. That way you can mix and match passive and active skills between Blood Codes and make your optimal build.Another strong point is the character customization which gives you a huge variety of options, from faces and body types to voice types and different outfits, all of which are customizable to a level not seen before for a Souls-like game. One of the best Fashion Souls game to date.Add to all of that great soundtrack, solid gameplay and well made levels and you have one of the best Souls-like games on the market. It's not without its flaws though, repetitive enemies and reused assets are the bigger offenders but they don't take away from the experience. Great for Souls-like fans, Anime-like (mostly God Eater) fans and anyone who wants a challenging game with a lot of replay value in it.			"

Recommended,91.2,"																Code Vein has that GE aesthetic in the art style down to the skill types with the Souls-ish combat. If you enjoyed the GE series you won't want to miss out on this title. The art style and character design is a more updated version of GE with Ufotable working on the animations yet again as well as Go Shiina on the music composing side of it (which is always an amazing combo). Gameplay  wise its a pretty much easier than the typical souls game so those looking for a hard/challenging game to play, this might not fill that itch for difficulty.  Co-op  is also more on the souls-side than GE. It isn't a complete co-op experience where you can join in on the story together throughout every bit of it. More like a drop in and help a friend (only 2 player co-op if you didn't already know). You can only join in on a player's progression/game if the Boss of the current level hasn't been defeated. So no re-doing zones/bosses that have been cleared. It isn't mission based, it's based on story progression and atm the only way to replay it is in NG+. Story  is rich and pretty much the main hook for the game for me. I really enjoyed seeing the characters develop and learning more about the game's lore. Yes, it is the typical ""silent protag, forgets memory (minor spoiler  although mostly everyone has memory loss in this game lol  ) and becomes part of a bigger situation upon waking up."" But, the way the story unfolds is creative in the way you progressively ""unravel"" everything.  Major Spoiler-ish  details  I was half expecting the CV universe to connect to the GE one and had a laugh at the Bugarally doll (gift item) reference. Thought that little bit was a nice head nod but I wasn't expecting to see a Dyaus Pita (bread) in the game. It proved that they are in the same universe but I won't go into detail how.			"

While i havnt played too much yet and havnt experianced the entire game, i think i can say that i have seen enough to comment about this particular one. Combat is wonky as hell, the weapons dont have much to differentiate them from ithers outside of damage and scalings. Like the movesets are damn near identical for most weapons. Another is that heavy attacks feel bad, at least with the heavier weapons. Like i was using the zweihander to level some skills and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the heavy attacks are bad. You press heavy and then press heavy again and the animation doesnt chain as it would a light. Basically the movesets need more variety and i wish it was less clunky and more smooth/clean (like dark souls). Other than that i am thoroughly enjoying everything else thus far. If you dont mind clunky combat then thisngame would be great.			"

It may be a bit linear unlike souls but I still find it to be just as good regardless.			"

Recommended,93.7,"																One of the best souls-like, and a solid 9/10. Don't listen to the critic reviews. Game has excellent OST, great story-telling (especially the vestige mechanic), and the best level of customisation I've seen in a game, from the character to creator to just the amount of stuff you can try with Blood Codes, Blood Veils and Weapons, being able to completely change your built in 2 minutes. The gameplay is similar to DS, but the game is significantly easier (other than one or two portions) due to the AI companion, allowing for casuals to enjoy it a lot more too. Art-style is not for everyone, but I liked it, as it's identical to God Eater. For people who aren't into JRPGs, don't get offed by the 'anime souls' comments. Other than a bit of fanservice here and there, the game is not as anime as people say.			"
Recommended,53.9,"																Just about what it says on the cover: Anime Dark Souls. It's a good game, but I personally don't think it's worth the full 80 dollars I spent for the deluxe pre-order. If the game goes on sale for at least 40$ or lower, then I think it would be a very worth buy. It lacks a bit of content, but they announced new DLC for next january, and since I have the season pass, I'll be playing it whenever it comes out. 8/10The big 3 DLCs have basically next to no story/lore and are more of a post-ending challenge arena of sorts. Most of the stuff isn't meta defining or anything, but there is one unlockable special attack that has nigh-infinite poise which is pretty nice.Full game was pretty dang worth the full price, but definitely don't pick up the DLC without a sale.Base game: 8.5/10DLCs: 6/10, probably 7/10 if on sale			"

Recommended,25.5,"																I was skeptical, until I wasn't.			"
Recommended,172.3,"																This game is the best of the genre for me hands down. Here's why: The Blood Code and Gift System When you level up, you don't pick a specific stat to level up, you just level up your character. What stats get stronger depends on what Blood Code you have equipped. Think of a Blood Code as a sort of class, defining what gear you can wear and what your strengths and weaknesses are, as well as what Gifts you can use. Each Blood Code comes with a number of Gifts that you can use while the specific Blood Code is equipped, but almost every Gift in the game can be mastered which allows you to use it on any Blood Code as long as you have the stats. Moreover, you're not chained to your Blood Code and can change it at any time, even during combat if you can menu it (though I don't recommend that) so you can try playing an agile assassin then switch to a devastating mage and then switch to a heavy-hitting melee build and see what suits your style with no punishment. The Character Creator When I first loaded up this game, I spent about two hours just making my character. There are so many things you can customize in so many ways, and the character creator is so in depth there's entire reddit threads dedicated to showing off characters made in the creator. Several video game and anime characters have been faithfully re-created in the editor and that says nothing of all the original characters that you or anyone else can come up with. Even the outfit you choose in the character creator is still important because of the way the armor equipment (Blood Veils) work, you'll still be able to see some or most of your clothes. You can save your characters as well, so you can always load them up just to take screenshots in various backgrounds and poses. The Storyline The story is incredibly well done in my opinion, and presented at a reasonable pace. The game doesn't directly explain everything, so you're able to take the time and try to piece together everything that happened and is happening, but a decent amount of the story is also explicitly explained by the characters in the story, so it's well balanced. A lot of times, I actually feel like I'm playing a movie or show, but the gameplay doesn't suffer for it either. The Combat System Combat follows the tried-and-true formula of the genre, with invincibility frames on dodges, a stamina gauge to manage, limited healing and a general focus on skillful play, but it's faster paced than other entries and has a few other unique twists that let this one stand out. One of the defining features is the ability to bring an AI companion with you, and even if you enjoy the challenge in games like these. The game seems to be balanced around having someone with you, and from a storyline perspective it also makes sense to bring allies because they explain things about the world and make everything feel less empty and alone. You can use your own HP to heal your partners, even reviving them from death if you use it within a few seconds of reaching 0 HP, and they can do the same for you. Another defining feature of this game is the Gift system and the Ichor that powers it. You have a certain amount of starting max Ichor based on your Blood Code (more on that later).  Ichor can be spent on using Gifts, and some weapons also have a Gift Trigger that expends Ichor. You gain Ichor by attacking enemies and the amount you gain is based on the particular weapons drain rating, but you can also increase your maximum Ichor by performing a Drain Attack, which is actually determined by your Blood Veil (essentially armor). The five types of Drain Attacks are:Charge Drain: fully charge a drain attack and releaseParry: block an attack during the parry's active framesBackstab: press the attack button while directly behind your enemyLaunch Drain: while Focused, launch the enemyCombo Drain: usable during any normal combo, but leaves you open and doesn't increase the max as much as other drainsThe game does have a checkpoint system in the form of Mistle, and resting at it will restore your health, healing and Ichor but you lose any extra max Ichor you've gained through Drain attacks. If you're able to play through areas well, you can actually gain an advantage for a boss encounter or the like by increasing max Ichor and fighting without resting, and since you can teleport to any activated Mistle you don't have to worry too much about losing progress.All in all, I have a really hard time finding fault with the game. If you like this genre, I can almost guarantee you'll love this game.			"

Recommended,32.3,"																A fantastically enjoyable entry to the ""souls-like"" genre.A quality character creator, dynamic class system, fast paced combat, and an optional AI companion all brought this game together for me.If you are even remotely a fan of any of the soulsborne games, I would say that Code Vein is worth a play through (or two).			"
Recommended,98.2,"																Really on the fence about recommending this...but I'm giving it a thumbs up anyway.It's basically Dark Souls but with vampires, but where Dark Souls had absolutely brilliant level and enemy design, this one is kind of inconsistent. I've enjoyed some levels a lot, like the Howling Pit, where the air was fog and there was water everywhere that made movement difficult so you really felt like you were hindered by the environment. I've also unfortunately been to the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, which is a jumping puzzle but in a game with no jump button. There are holes that you can't see until you've fallen into them and died, all the paths are stacked on top of each other so the minimap is unreadable, and 80% of the pathways are based on hidden 1 way drop points so you end up backtracking through the level over and over again looking down off the edge of every path hoping to find something you missed.""Difficulty"" is based entirely on 2 factors, whether you get stun locked, and whether they get stun locked. If you do, you lose. If they do, they lose. There you go, that's every battle. Bosses can't be stun locked, but they can still stun lock you, so good luck if you miss a dodge, because you'll die before you get control of your character back.The story seems pretty good so far, if rather predictable. If you've watched anime, you'll probably know what I mean. Certain tropes and story archetypes are employed that are very common in Japanese storytelling which I found novel and exciting when I was 13, but now that I'm 30 I've seen them all before. You've got the ethereal waif girl, the likeable bruiser who values his friends, the serious intellectual with a guilt complex, all working together to change the status quo so people and vampires can live together in harmony etc etc but it's very well presented and enjoyable despite its predictability.

Recommended,60.1,"																Basically, Code Vein is anime af Dark Souls, which you can choose to play like a souls-game, harder solo-mode, or in easy-mode with your overpowered NPC partner destroying everything. Personally, I see no fault in playing with the NPC partner enabled, since the beautiful visuals, great soundtrack and especially the story are certainly strong enough a reason to play the game even if you're not maso enough for a souls-like. However, if you do decide to solo run the game, you can definitely add to the experience with the extra challenge.That said, it is still in no way Souls levels of difficult, and if you're not into very anime-inspired stuff, the game might not be for you.Oh, and the character customization? It's amazing. You can waste so much time just with that.TL;DR: Anime Souls with great story and optional EZ-mode.			"
Recommended,209.1,"																A worthy Souls like. Code Vein has a unique class and weapon system, with blood codes, blood veils, and vestiges. This allows you to mix and match to make a fun build tailored to your play style. The character customization is amazing and you can create a truly unique character.  The combat which is at the core of any souls like game is well represented here. The combat can feel a touch flouty at times but rarely due you run into a any BS deaths. The different weapons feel distinct enough between archtypes and you should be able to find one that fits what you want to do.The main downside to the game is the locations, while the over all world building that is done throughout the narrative is unique and compelling, the levels and locations themselves are a letdown. Almost none of the areas feel unique or inspired, and at times can blend into one and other with little distinction. If you are a fan of souls like games this is definitely one to check out as long as you don't mind the anime asthetics.			"

Recommended,68.6,"																Cute and Sexy.It's good for you. :3			"
Recommended,206.4,"																What can I say about Code Vein, combat is decent and generally engaging. Weaponry seems to be secondary to technique, though don't let me fool you there are OP builds that rely on specific set ups so it's not all skill. Graphically the game is  weird, personally I found it pretty and ugly at the same time, something about the detailed surroundings yet anime style characters made me confused. Though in comparison to other Bandi Namco games at least the character customization is detailed and not shallow so thumbs up for that. Right at the beginning of Code Vein you are thrown into this world seemingly no memory of how you got there and are introduced to the surroundings via something like flash back sequences, exploration, and cutscenes. I found the flashback sequence of giving backstory kind of novel since not only do you get some history on your companions but also some nifty powers out it. However in my opinion the Code Vein's major flaw is it feels more empty than a Bethesda game. While playing Code Vein the game references governments, Revenants (vampires) and humans yet you rarely meet any people or vampires to make you feel like the world is anything but empty. The empty world combined with the lack of a player connection to the world makes the motivation for saving it lukewarm at best. This and this alone put a huge damper on my enjoyment of the game (wish steam would add a ""meh"" recommendation button). So final verdict, if you just want something to spend time looking at pretty scenery, fun combat and don't care about story all that much pick this game up. However if you are like me and you like to be slightly invested in what you play wait for a sale or some kind of expansion that adds more than just enemies to fight.			"

Recommended,28.7,"																Really, the only things I didn't like about this game were the style and the fact that I barely ever managed to get summoned to another player's world. No idea why the latter was a problem. Why didn't I like the style? Anime looks bad in 3D in my opinion, that's all. That's okay though, really, because only the faces of characters were generically anime-like, so if I didn't look at them too much I got by fine.Code Vein is a souls-like hack-and-slash. It's the Dark Souls of anime. :^)It's got a *huge* amount of customisation options for your character, and you can get very inventive with something you wouldn't normally be able to use, kinda like how Soul Calibur VI got so popular for creative character designs. If you don't mind the fact that they didn't account for every time someone put extra hair or accessories on their character and they clipped because there's so much hanging off your character at once, you won't have a problem with the character creation aspect of this game.Gameplay is pretty fun. While there's only a few different kinds of weapons (big heavy weapons, small fast weapons, and bayonets) the real variety to gameplay lies in your chosen blood code (governs your abilities and stats) and your blood vein (governs some other stats). It's pretty easy to optimise a one-shot build but there's plenty of room to get creative. One issue I have though is that you can't fight with just your fists. I know it's petty but beating bosses in Dark Souls with just your fists was great fun.Music? Absolutely phenomenal. I believe the composer worked on God Eater, so you can imagine the kind of orchestral epics that this game pumps out at you. A few of the tracks are repeated a bit too much because they're just meant for bosses that aren't strongly plot-related, but besides that the music's great.Oh yeah. And there is, in fact, a point down gesture you can use in multiplayer to make fun of other players, so that's a big plus if you're a Dark Souls memeposter.			"

Recommended,38.7,"																The story is basically a huge cliché but it takes itself seriously enough that it becomes incredibly humorous and fun to play.

No more running away to cast, or having to sacrifice power for speed!PS The character creator is absolutely fantastic, offers loads of editing options, and allowed me to achieve results far beyond what I was expecting. Well worth a buy, even if you aren't particularly good at Souls-like games. The game is not too difficult and allows you to switch builds on the fly, meaning you will never regret skill / spell choices.It's great fun, especially if you like to use a variety of weapons and skill builds.

Recommended,57.9,"																A pretty decent Soulsborne-style game, could be great depending on your preferences.One thing that stands out, to me, is the combat and world design (including world design re: level design). If you've played Bandai's previous Soulsborne-ish (far more Monster Hunter inspired tbh) God Eater series, you should have a decent idea of what to expect- there's a somewhat similar mechanic to ""eating,"" and IMO combat does feel more polished compared to the God Eater titles I've played, though perhaps it's possibly a feeling of added weightiness to it that I prefer over their past games. The world design is gorgeous at times, decent at others and better in general compared to past God Eater titles, even 3. The post-apocalyptic, vampiric style also just really works, I'm definitely a fan of it.Character customization is pretty great; there's a lot of unique options regarding eyes/hair etc in particular. I can't speak for male character creation, so looking that up in other reviews is probably a good idea. However, in my experience so far, it's still limited in certain ways I feel they didn't really need to include- for example, accessory limits and the fact that outside of accessories/jackets, there are only several different outfits you can (somewhat) customize.Difficulty is reasonable IMO; you can always get someone to help you if you need it (and there's decent motivation to help others) so it shouldn't be too unfriendly to newcomers to the genre, either. Otherwise, there are cool combat mechanics (personally a fan of bayonets and polearms) and weapon variance within different weapons of the same type; the class system also works well for this game.It's definitely the kind of game that would satisfy both Soulsborne fans, and semi-casual players.

Recommended,39.5,"																Fun game with a lot of customization, and an interesting story. The gameplay is also solid and fun with the active skills and the ability to essentially change your class at will to vary your playstyle, and the multiplayer aspect is also good even though there is no PVP. Overall, it is still a great (mostly) Singleplayer game that is well worth the price. Definitely recommended.			"
Recommended,36.3,"																Code Vein has been called anime Dark Souls from the moment it was first revealed, and while I think that is an accurate description on paper, I think it doesn't do the game enough justice, as despite the very clear inspiration and comparison, this game stands out a lot more from it than most of the Souls-like games that have followed since.For starters, this game has a proper, relatively easy to follow plot, which I personally liked. As much as I love Souls games, the fact that you need to read every item and watch tons of Youtube videos to understand the deeper meaning of it all can be frustrating, so having an actual plot in the game, as well as characters was a nice change in my opinion; one that mostly works out for the best (despite some cutscenes being relatively long at times).On topic of characters, having AI companion with you is another big change to the typical formula. To those who don't feel like it, can also play the game solo, but it's clearly intended to be played with a companion, which makes for an interesting experience, as well as making exploring that much less depressing in the dark world, when you have someone by your side to chat and help you out.Third aspect that I really liked is the freedom of choice when it comes to combat, as the game has tons of different choices. Not just in terms of weaponry, but rather the styles and abilities. At first they can feel quite overwhelming and needlessly complex, but after a few hours they clicked for me. I'm not the type to usually replay these sorts of games, but Code Vein is the first Souls game I'm genuinely intrigued to replay, just to tinker and experiment with the combat system.I waited for this for a long time and I'm happy that the one year delay paid off. It's Souls game, but one that very much stands on it's own legs, with enough unique systems and changes to make it more than just a copycat game. It's inspirations are clear, but it makes enough changes to the formula to really be it's own creature. Who knew that being anime vampire in post apocalyptic world would be this much fun? Very highly recommended.			"

Recommended,95.9,"																While Code Vein clearly pays homage to Dark Souls, is isn't nearly as refined. It is, however, quite polished and enjoyable to play. The visuals are crisp, the combat is fun, there is a coherent storyline. What the game lacks in certain departments is, in part, compensated by a large variety of builds & skills to play with. The fact that builds are so easily swapped out or rearranged ultimately adds a lot of flavour to the experience.Without going into too much detail I recommend this game for Soulslike enthusiasts who want a decent pick-me-up.

Recommended,45.1,"																Think Dark Souls but with Anime Waifus			"
Recommended,49.5,"																So a quick heads up to anyone wanting to play this, this isn't dark souls.  Doing something like a solo, level one, no skills run or something similar, will end poorly.  The game is built with co-op in mind.  It's got AI companions baked into the game.  That said, the way you co-op is irritating as well.  As it uses more of a monster hunter style method to summoning/being summoned.  So if you want to help people, you won't be able to do anything in game while waiting to be summoned.As such, the bosses are not built with solo players in mind.  If you aim to try and play that way, some of the bosses will be very unfair.  Most notable is their version of O&S.  Many of the bosses have big AOE attacks, fast startup animations for their attacks, and so on.  The game is very fast paced and unforgiving, especially if you play without companions.  As an example, their version of O&S has a very fast melee boss, and a big slow ranged one that doesn't even really require line of sight to hit you.  If you want to beat them solo, you have to not only kite the melee boss and contend with her while avoiding ranged attacks, but you have to contend with the games mechanics where many enemies/bosses, don't really have a lot of openings and their small.  So you'll need to be more or less perfect against her without resorting to some kind of OP stat that makes the fight a joke, or using companions.That all aside however, if you want to play with friends, random people online, or even use the AI companions, then you'll likely enjoy yourself with the game as I did.  The game also has a very JRPG styled story and obvious inspirations from things like JRPG's and anime.  Like the stereotypical JRPG trope where the cutscenes show you with all your companions going ""We'll stop him!"" then immediately followed by you in the fight with only the one companion you've chosen to fight with.There's is also a huge amount of variety and customization in the various builds and the character creator for you the have fun with.  Allowing you the make a ridiculous build for whatever weapon or fighting style you enjoy.  Whether that be focusing on something like poison, one handed swords, big stronk weapons, guns, magic, etc.  Each build can be quite OP with the right skills as you progress.  You also can't unlock everything in just one run of the game.  It will take at least 2 runs to unlock every skill, and more to get every ending.  So there's a fair amount of replayability in that regard.So if you want to get this game, take all that in mind.  Especially if you plan to try and play solo or without companions or some other ridiculous challenge styled run.  Try the game as it's intended first, then, if you're feeling up for it, try the solo route.  Otherwise you're likely to have a bad time and impression of the game at large due to the way it's balanced.			"

Recommended,32.3,"																Character Customization is great, legit anime dark souls but easier(sadly). Wish you could cancel animations(healing, attacking->has to commit to actions), needs more base clothing, or better clothing options (as said everything but the outfits are fine for customization's, should allow us more accessories and the ability to morph them such as black ops 2 emblems). We should also be able to change the color or length of the actual blood veils. Gameplay wise it's pretty much a run and gun, few deaths here and there.

Recommended,102.5,"																Code Vein is essentially the harmony of Souls mixed with anime. You are given the chance to literally customize your own anime character and slay monsters. The story premise and development between all the characters is solidly built and attention grabbing. The game runs smoothly with precision and is easy to understand the controls. The levels are pretty big and comfortably challenging. With over 20 hours played and not even close to being done, this game is %100 worth the money if you choose to invest.			"

Recommended,22,"																The game by itself is very well made and has a deep, entrancing story behind it. The combat and variety of Weapons/Blood Codes/Veils you can use keeps the game interesting until you find a weapons move set you like. The character models are well done with player characters being extremely customizable. Word of caution to those who have played lots of and are in love with From Software's Souls Series....this game feels slow and clunky compared to it. Lock on system feels too tight and has a hard time swapping properly. Small gripe but it had me grunting quite often is that when opening the game menu, the highlight remains where it last was before being closed instead of resetting position, so there is no muscle memory to find things for quick switching or people with visual impairments.All in All i recommend this game as something thats worth picking up as at least a side game if it doesn't strike your fancy much.

Especially since rest of the game ran smoothly in max settings. Also ""backstab"" hitbox felt bit irregular at times.			"
Recommended,86.5,"																Amazing and intriguing storyline that makes you ask alot of questions very early on with Intriguing character lore, the game forces you to explore if you want to learn more either about the characters or just to gain power, either way you are engulfed with info about people and places, while giving you a very mellowed down souls-like gameplay. Plus its fun.			"
Recommended,97.7,"																This is like Dark Souls, but expanded in RPG style of gameplay and the ability to swap classes (mid game) to change your playstyle.  You can go alone (as people have done so and was made possible by creators) or with an NPC companion (if wanna have unique experience and easier time... especially against a specific boss battle that's very very very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult to do alone)  Unlike Dark Souls, I didn't get bored or become weaponless (near beginning of game) Your weapons don't break in this game and some weapons have unique features and attacks.  There's also side quests that sometimes unlock maps to new optional... dungeons basicallyThings that need improving or that weren't good were... more variety of boss battle music. More bosses would've been cool, and maybe a longer storyline.. But again these weren't detrimental to the enjoyment.I love how, unlike souls, you get spells to attack from a distance and bayonet guns... though you can't stay at a distance all the time as you need to deal some melee damage and drain attacks to regain Ichor (you spell pool basically) and special attacks or abilities can be used as well to do elemental damage, increase dodge speed, unleash powerful attack combos.  The list of powers is pretty big and can be used in combination with others, though certain classes (blood codes) have such powers and abilities restricted only to them, unless you max proficiency in it			"

Love RPG Games? Love Monster Hunter series? Love Devil May Cry Series? Then this is definitely the game for you!*Gameplay*Dark Souls style of gameplay mixed with Monster Hunter, that's what I can feel when playing. I've only sunk in 3 hours of my time for this and I'm enjoying every aspect and every single thing about it.There's a ""Parry/Balance"" meter thing just like Sekiro, where if it fills you'll have your defense broken.Then there's the element of Devil May Cry with Hack&Slash style of gameplay, quite a quick pace game if you ask me.*Story*I'm not really that deep into the story yet as I've just played roughly 3 hours of content, so I can't really tell much about it. The only point I can say is it's good enough for me to keep playing, I'd usually skip everything if the story is too boring but this catches my attention every single second.*Downsides*Of course, no games are perfect. Every game has their own downsides.There are still bugs that happen from time to time which needs to be fixed.I've gotten into a situation where I could not exit the shop menu after entering it and have to restart the game and start back to where I've left off. If I had made progress and hadn't saved the game and the bug happened, it'll be a big waste of time for me. Character Creation - 90% of the things are available to be adjusted, but boob size, body size, etc can't be adjusted, which is very sad for me.That is all for my review, might do another after I've finished New Game+			"
Recommended,56.4,"																It's a pretty fun game, and I've enjoyed my time with it, but I do have some negatives to say.1. The story is really in your face and kind of annoying. I'm not against a story, but the cutscenes are just never-ending. I guess it's weird coming straight out of Dark Souls where cutscenes are mainly just to set the mood for a boss or to show you travelling, but here it's just people talking for minutes about something that I'd rather skip in a dialogue box once I've read the subtitles.2. Game is EASY. Maybe I'm just an epic elite gamer #GamerStrong, but I am not being challenged by this game much at all. I'm able to beat most bosses on my first or second tries despite them being hyped up as super spooky dooky enemies. There are occasionally ""invasions"" where random enemies will begin swarming you in waves, and these can prove to be a challenge as it's hard to focus on just one at a time. One of these invasions is a lot harder than any boss I've faced so far, and it's only halfway through the game. All the others before and after are a lot easier. This point has rambled a bit, but yeah, game's easy except that one invasion.3. I don't have a third thing I dislike enough to mention about this game. The map can be kinda confusing but I might also just be an idiot, after the first few missions I got stuck and the hint at the base didn't help at all, uhh that's it.Overall good game. If you're looking for a Soulslike experience and can get past these negatives I've mentioned, check it out.			"

Recommended,203.7,"																This game is halfway between a Devil May Cry and a Soulsborne game. The combat is fun, the plot picks up after about 10 hours to something engaging, and the character customization is deeper than you'd expect. Companions are actually really useful and you can create fun fighting styles of your own. Some of the bosses are rage-inducing while others are a walk in the park so it's a nice mix.			"

Recommended,35.4,"																I'm not a fan of either Dark Souls or Souls-like, but I have to admit, when I heard this was about weird anime vampires, I was kind of interested. I watched it develop and waited for reviews and decided to get it. Code Vein is definitely a fairly easy game. There are a couple of cheap moments like the one boss towards the end of the game, but everything is laid out pretty decently with no real unfair nature to it. The locations are pretty dull, though. A couple stand outs are here and there, but overall, nothing too memorable. It's long too, so you'll get your money's worth out of it, which is nice and it doesn't look too bad either. All the character models look and animate great. It basically boils down to if you liked the look of God Eater, then you'll like this as well. I'd say it's worth a buy, or if you want to wait for a sale, that's fair too.			"

Recommended,135.5,"																Remember the ps2/3 era of games? Where you can feel the atmosphere of the game? Play it for hours and still learn new stuff about the game? Where the game developers didn't cared about throwing  politics down our throat or about the political correctness BS? And more importantly where you paid for a game and the game actually had a lot of content? Without microtransactions everywhere?Yeah, this game has that classic ps2 era feeling! And it's amazing!Everyone said it's a ""souls like"" game or ""anime dark souls"", but i personally don't care about dark souls, for me, code vein is more like a love child between a classic shin megami tensei (like nocturne) + soul reaver (not just for the vampires, but for level design and atmosphere) Speaking of which, the level design is amazing, some reviews said ""its simple, just a place to fight"" but I disagree, every level is pretty straightforward, YES. But the atmosphere and variety is pretty amazing. You can actually feel some fear going to certain places and you will have that sense of discovery finding a new place or a new item. I HATE backtracking in games but code vein does backtracking surprisingly well, Zelda levels of fun backtracking! It's really fun revisiting previous levels. And the Teleport system helps a lot with this task! Very well done! Character creation! Not even joking, of my 40 hours of gameplay (at this time) I have easily 15 hours just making characters! It's so good! Not even on Sims I spend so many hours doing characters. Just the character creator worth the full price! SERIOUSLY! Especially if you are an anime or comics fan!  Graphics The game looks pretty amazing! Specially the characters! I took 500+ screenshot in 3 hours of gameplay. And there is mods for even better graphics . With the ""True HDR"" mod on NexusMod the game looks even better!  Mods Mods are available at Nexus Mods. It's super easy to install (paste the pak file inside a folder and you are done). We have some character and graphics mods at the moment!! Combat The combat system is pretty simple tbh. Dodge the right time and hit. Sometimes use magic and that's it, but yes, There is a lot of weapons but only 5 types of weapons, you have to find the stronger and that's it, but I'm not a good source of information for that, because I'm not a hardcore player of ""souls like"" games, but having said that, I did enjoy the combat a lot. I died a few times. It's not necessarily super hard.. Some of the bosses are hard but not impossible, after 2 o 3 tries you will defeat it. If not, just look up for a stronger weapon.Other bosses you will defeat them in one try.EDIT: If you are playing it solo, without any AI Partner or Online Friend, It's really hard!  AI The AI partner is great! It show your useful items, give you tips if you are lost, revives you if you die, they made a lot of damage to the enemy, they don't block your way! Enemy AI: is fine. They use magic, sword, axe, firearms, they can block your attacks, The bosses have pretty unique moves. They can for example use a magic attack in the first phase of the fight but if you die and try again the battle, they can change that phase. It's not always the same. Story So far its weird, cool and original. It has anime storytelling, so You know, anything is possible here haha I'm not a big fan of the flashback memories but it's fine. Not a big deal.  The music / voices  The music is mostly violin and piano, sounds really amazing! Voice (dubbed to English) its fine, there are some recognizable people in the cast! Sounds good, But nothing mind blowing.  The bad I only have 3 bad things to say,1*  The game starts and throws at you so much information about the world and the game , ""icoh, revenant, parasites, blood veins, code vein, miasma, blood code, vestiges, etc etc"" and that's only in the first 15 min. And you are like WTF IS HAPPENING! It's just too much information at once! 2* This game has an opening but it doesn't show by default! You have to wait in the title screen for a few seconds to appear! And it's an amazing opening too! 3* Not a bad thing about the game but the game is truly unique, and if you want something like this, well, too bad, there isn't anything else like it. After this I will probably install Soul Reaver and TRY to make it work !Worth the full price!! 			"

Recommended,100.8,"																This game is kind of inexplicably enjoyable.The plot is predictable and honestly not that creative. If you watch anime with even passing regularity you'll see the whole thing coming.The level design is kind of boring for most of the game's run time. The enemies and bosses vary between passably challenging and completely absurd. The whole thing is pretty obviously Dark Souls with permanent companions and an anime aesthetic.Still, I've put over 100 hours into it. The combat system is nicely polished (even if the equipment list is kind of shamefully small), and I'm *still* learning new tricks something like seven playthroughs in.. But I feel like what really sells it is just the sincerity of the whole thing. Yeah, it's anime, it's chuuni, it's cliched, it's totally just another Souls-like. But it does all of these things with such enthusiasm and energy that it's kind of hard not to have fun with it. The ridiculously over-the-top crit animations, the cheesy oversized weapons, and the companions that won't shut up about the Power of Friendship - it's all so relentless that you can't help being taken in. Also the character creator is nice.So, to sum up, it's pretty good, even though it doesn't really have any right to be. I'm not sure I'd call it revolutionary, or even one of my games of the year, but it's well worth playing if you're on the fence about it.			"

Recommended,38.2,"																Code Vein is a game defined by its relationship with Dark Souls. I don't really like Dark Souls. I've always liked the IDEA of Dark Souls, but the density, complexity, and sheer difficulty combined always put me off in one way or another. Code Vein does not skimp on any of these things, but what it DOES do is make them APPROACHABLE. For the first time, going into a soulslike game, I felt like I knew what I was doing. I felt like I wasn't fighting an awkward control scheme. I felt like I wasn't building my character wrong. And it does all this while having a gameplay formula 99% identical to Dark Souls.There are a few ways I feel like Code Vein helps make itself the more approachable alternative to Dark Souls.Most notably, the Blood Code system. Simply put, these are character classes, but with two major twists. First, you can switch between them at will, being given a premade array of stats suited to that playstyle. Second, you can unlock any class' skills for use with every other class very easily. These two things mean there is NO wrong way to build a character. In Dark Souls, I could put my stats into the wrong places and be stuck with it for the rest of the playthrough. In Code Vein, if your stats are wrong for the situation at hand, you can just change classes. If you didn't pick the class that has the skill you need, it's just a matter of playing through some areas you've cleared already with the other class for a few minutes to get the skill unlocked. Another way Code Vein differs from Dark Souls is the presence of a clear and direct storyline. Some people very much like the freedom of Dark Souls and not being told where to go, but having that clear objective, not being able to wander into too high level of an area, helps make Code Vein much less intimidating.The third major thing Code Vein does to help ease new players in is give you a more or less constant NPC companion. You can turn them off if you just want to handle things on your own, but having that extra body there doing damage and taking damage (and potentially reviving you when you die) is just the extra icing on the cake for a player who is intimidated by Dark Souls.None of this is to say this game is easy. I spent three hours fighting the second boss in the game, but never once did I feel like I couldn't do it. I only felt like I needed to pick the right class, find the right weapon, the right strategy. In Dark Souls, you can't adapt like that. When you pick a build, you're stuck with it. You might be able to switch weapons, but almost certainly at a cost of efficacy.None of this is to say this game is shallow. I've spent a long time experimenting with different weapons, different spells, different classes, trying to find the best options for each scenario. Most of the systems in the game function almost entirely identically to their Dark Souls counterparts, or are even more complex. Code Vein just does a better job of teaching you how they work. Code Vein is the best of Dark Souls, refined and made palatable for those who are unwilling or unable to deal with From Software's lack of care for accessibility. If you like Dark Souls, absolutely play this game.If you don't like Dark Souls, I still urge you to play this game, because ease of entry turns out to mean so much more than you'd think.			"

Recommended,233.3,"																At one point, I think I had like 50 hours in the first 2 weeks of getting this game. First ""SoulsLike"" game that I've touched and I really did enjoy it. I did play Nier but the combat system is too different to be called a ""Souls"" game so this was my first time playing a game like this.Ran this with an NPC partner and played with a friend every once in a while. Definitely died a lot while learning the game, with certain bosses melting my face off (to this day I would say that the first fight against the second boss actually took me like +20 tries). Second playthrough and then the NG+ playthrough was definitely a lot easier because I got a good grasp of the game mechanics.Definitely enjoyed the story (not its selling point) just enough to not skip cutscenes which is impressive considering my patience is nonexistent. The character creation was the best creation screen I've ever used and the blood code system was very fun to mess around with (I wish there was more explanation on how stats like strength and dexterity worked with your weapons and stuff). Definitely did enjoy this game and I'll probably be doing a solo run of the game and NG+. Worth the money and a very fun time sink.			"

Recommended,105.4,"																One of the things ive noticed in the community is that a lot of people are comparing this game to Dark Souls, Ni-oh or God Eater, and imo, to go into this game with that mindset is bad mkay, that's bad. The game itself does have its problems in the form of lack of weapon and enemy diversity. Most weapons have the same move set with the exception of the heavy attack. I wish it could be a bit better but its fine for what it is.Story is ok, i enjoyed playing through it. The idea of going through and viewing memories the way this game does is somewhat interesting and at times i did end up tearing up, expecially towards two specific characters. Its not as in depth as most other stories but its was good for a stand alone game, very anime like. Game play wise, it does feel like a souls like game, you got your dodges, your parries, your backstabs, your perma staggering if you have Yakumo on your team and are also using a heavy weapon. The game could use some work such as certain hitboxes but overall once i got back into my groove i could mistaken this game as a souls game with how similar the game plays.Maps are different, unique, and if you dont pay attention you can get easily turned around *cough Citadel cough* but they are unique, only real gripe is that there is lack of enemy types, or rather enemy patterns. you learn one you pretty much learn them all.Overall the game is good, i enjoyed it, it has a cheesy story but i like cheesy anime style stories. I went into this game with the intention of playing it as a stand alone game without comparing it to others, and overall i ended up enjoying the game. Would i recommend this game? Yes, but only to those that like cheesy anime stories.			"

"
Recommended,16.2,"																Before I begin, I've been waiting for this game since it was announced and when pre-orders became available I immediately purchased the game that I have been wanting to play badly. After playing on release, I have to say that it did not disappoint, however, it was neither a masterpiece.This deviates from 'souls-like' formula slightly but in essence remains similar like any other. With an anime themed souls game this very much isn't a game for everyone.For those that are interested however, this game would be worth picking up and here's why;-Great narrative, this game focuses on more story-telling aspect rather than having you, the player, find clues and piece together the story. I very much like this take on the game and the creator themselves did great to orchestrate the narrative.-Fun combat, as it suggests, the combat system feels very satisfying and opens a lot of different play styles to pick and choose from.-Rewarding progression, there are distinct checkpoints and areas, progressing is much more linear and is satisfyingfor completion-Build diversity, I was skeptical at first for having blood codes the only way to change your stats, however with the variety of blood codes this game offers it is safe to say that many builds and play style can be created without having to level your stats manually. This is a creative concept and also eradicates the 'respec' mechanical as you can easily swap out blood codes and change it at will.These positives very much complimenting the bare bones of CODE VEIN and there are other great things about this game to talk about. As such there are always downsides for this game.-Lack of diverse enemies, many of the enemies are reused, reskinned and thrown back into areas throughout your journey. fighting the same kinds of 'Lost' becomes a nuisance rather than a challenge after a few ng+ cycles even with the fun combat. It felt as if it was rushed with the copy and paste of the enemies.-Strange/Inconsistent enemy placement, sometimes enemies are where they're expected to be, sometimes they're not where you expect they'd be, and other times there is a mish-mash horde where you have to deal with constant ganking. -Parrying, this is a nitpick rather than a problem itself. first off, it's very slow like veeeery slow, a 1 second wind up where you have to literally look into the future and plan for the enemy attack rather than it being instinctive or reading choreographed attacks. you can obviously beat the game without parrying a single time and most people do just that. This mechanic is flawed and useless and it's there just for the sake of checking the 'souls-formula' box.-Hitbox/Backstab, a 2 in 1, hitboxes are a little clunky in where some attacks seem to connect when it isn't supposed to, this makes walking around an attack to conserve stamina a gamble on your health. Back stabs are weird too the area for a backstab is directly behind the hitbox rather than it being the 'true' behind on the enemy model (it's inconsistent but it's better than parrying)I love this game but there are improvements to be made. And also the release of the game isn't a glitchy mess, so kudos to that.Final score: 7.5/10			"

Recommended,61.1,"																I'll try to review this both in comparison to Soulsborne games and as a stand-alone product.* GraphicsThe graphics in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful. I feel like every game should have its own aesthetic or motif, a visual style that represents it and sets it apart from others. Code Vein's style is, as you might've heard, definitely anime influenced and it carries that well. I haven't run into any instances of ""Wow that's cringy"" or anything else that would detract from the overall theme presented by the graphics.Likewise, each zone and area has its own aesthetic about it. You'll be in sunny, outdoors areas, and then descend underground to a dimly lit cavern. The graphics adequately convey the mood and setting.* Character CreationI will, without a doubt or sense of shame, spend hours in character creator making whatever I envision in my mind. Code Vein's character creator is pretty good, honestly. There are some things to be desired and there are some problems, however. As for the good parts, you're able to create just about anything you can think of. The preset character designs show off what the creator process can do. There are some missing options, like makeup choices, some sliders/options for certain parts of the body, and some of the accessory hair items run into weird layering with the graphics that make it awkward to use.With all that said, it's not bad. I think Dark Souls and Bloodborne had a lot of room for improvement but Code Vein isn't worse than those. I'll point out that this game doesn't sport Black Desert Online levels of character creator but it's not bad. I'm happy with my character.There are limits, though. You can only set so many colors on certain items and your accessories each have a cost with a pre-determined limit. Additionally, not everything can be ""modified"" in the way you think it can. The creator lets you change the positioning of certain items but it doesn't always turn out as expected. Let's just say you can't make a chained collar by combining and rotating several other accessories. Still, not bad.* AudioThe audio's not bad. In fact, I don't have any complaints about it. It's pretty sweet. There are lots of ambient tracks used to really hammer the tension/setting of an area and there are booming, uplifting tracks to signify a dangerous boss. There's also a general combat track that plays whenever you enter combat. So the odds of you getting sneak attacked from behind are lower but still not impossible.I've played this game with both English and Japanese dubs. The English dubs are pretty good. No one's voice seemed out of place or out of character except for maybe a certain mad scientist wielding an UGS. The Japanese dubs are also serviceable.I... genuinely don't have any complaints.* GameplayWhew boy. If you're expecting classic Dark Souls gameplay, you're not gonna get it. First off, no shields. This game takes the Nioh approach by having weapons inherit defensive stacks and allow for blocking with those. Secondly, I hope you're comfortable with weight tiers affecting rolling because that's a thing here too.The game sports a variety of possible playstyles. There's the typical melee build, an ultra-class melee build, ranged combat by using Dark Gifts of Rifles (Bayonets), or a more supportive style with Light Gifts. Each weapon in its own class is different as well. Aside from base stats, scaling, damage types, and defensive stats, each weapon has its own moveset for the most part. There are some duplicates but that's fine.If you're familiar with Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 mana system, it's sort-of present in this one as well. You use Ichor to cast Dark and Light Gifts. Ichor is restored through some drop-only consumables, using other Dark Gifts, or by hitting the enemy with a melee weapon. Each weapon has a Drain Rating which affects how fast you gain Ichor per swing. There is no 100% ranged/caster build unless you run a very specific build and get good at dodging.It's also worth mentioning your character does not have base stats. Your character innately has null values for all stats. The Blood Code you equip gives you your stats. Kinda neat! Additionally, your only source of armor is your Blood Veil. Blood Veils are used to execute backstabs, parries, and special drain attacks. There are about 4 types, iirc. Lastly, blood veils can augment your dark/light gift scaling but not your weapon scaling.* The StoryWithout giving spoilers, the story's pretty good. You do get the chance to learn backstories, motivations, and see things come to a close in 3/4 different ways. You also have the chance to save or sacrifice certain characters which affects the ending you get. I kinda expected this to be some, to be blunt, typical anime ♥♥♥♥ but I was pretty surprised. I did get somewhat emotionally invested and it was nice to see how it all came together. I will admit there are certain parts that seemed to have pacing problems but, as a complete product, eh, it was pretty good.I wouldn't compare this story to Dark Souls or Bloodborne for the simple reason that they are very, very different types of storytelling and serve their story (or lack thereof) in very different manners.* ProblemsI'm currently on NG+3. I've maxed out every Blood Code, I've acquired all weapons and blood veils and leveled them all to +9/10. I've also done some research into things I couldn't figure out myself.I'd mostly liken this game to Nioh. In the sense that as NG iterations grow higher (and you choose to increase difficulty), damage starts to ramp up to levels that are not sustainable. Add to this the possibility of layering attacks causing stunlocks and certain hyper-aggressive bosses literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you unless you run a 100% block defense setup, you will get one-shotted pretty often.Why did I bring up Nioh? Because it's pretty similar. You focus on locking down the enemy or simply not getting hit. Likewise, at least for me, I found it best to play by focusing on one attribute/gameplay element and just focusing everything on that. I have a few builds I use for co-op depending on the situation and boss and switch between them as needed. Each one is focused into a single thing and do them adequately.Another problem is UI related. I think it'd be nice if maxed out gifts/passives has a tooltip displaying their source. I've given advice on this game to others and it's kinda painful scrolling through every blood code to find the source of one gift/passive just because I forgot where it came from. My last problem is with itemization. Certain items just completely ♥♥♥♥ on everything else. There's one UGS that, while having tremendous weight, offers the highest damage potential, decent moveset, and 100% physical block. Comparing other UGS weapons and dumping everything into scaling, they just don't compare.Likewise for Bayonets, one Bayonet just outshines the rest for the general purpose of a Bayonet - The being range control.On the topic of Blood Veils, well, it kinda makes sense (i guess) for a single Blood Veil to outshine others for a particular purpose. However, I've just... never equipped some of them because they don't offer anything in particular over their better counterparts. I don't think this is a problem that can be easily solved and falls under the category of ""leveling item"" or ""use it until you get a vertical upgrade"" but it's something to point out.* Would I recommend this game?Oh hell yes. This game's fun as hell. Combine the aesthetic with lots of actives/passives and you've got some anime-tier ♥♥♥♥ going on. Also, the hitboxes are TIGHT. I've done spinning flips and dodged horizontal attacks because my character was in the air. Dark Souls 2 can kiss my ass.			"
Recommended,94.2,"																5 of October was the day, when I beat Code Vein for the first time and get ""To Eternity"" ending. On 12 of October I beat the game for the second time and get ""Dwellers in the Dark"" ending. And now I want to write my thoughts about this awesome game!First of all: I LOVE souls-like games. And just as much as I love them, I love anime-style games. And I love japanese voices(cuz eng dub in anime\anime games is pain to my ears).Code Vein is an awesome game. Characters are well developed, story is very interesting.The plot intrigued me since the beginning, and it doesn't disappoint me. Some moments bring tears to my eyes(especially Mia's final moments with Nicola, and Yakumo's final moments with Emily. Yes, FINAL MOMENTS, cuz I've failed a bit on my first playthrough)This game is clearly NOT ""Dark Souls in anime style"". It has story, cutscenes and NPC partners that are not summoned through signs. And all partners have their own unique voice lines both in exploration and in some story moments.Leveling is not that crucial, because parameters(like Strength, Agility etc.) are locked to passive skills and Blood Code that currently in use.Playing with partner make game more enjoyable, if you want to play for story. If you're a hard Souls fan, then you can try solo.But some bosses can be even harder than Smough and Ornstein.Overall, I'll give this game 10\10. To me this is the game of the year. And pre-purchase was worth it. Gonna wait for Code Vein 2. Thank you Bandai Namco and Ufotable! And big thanks to all people who create music!Amber Journey is masterpiece. Also I wonder is Amber Journey have Japanese version? Because Eva is surely sings very similar song. If she sings not Amber Journey, then can somebody tell my which song does she sings?			"

Recommended,29.2,"																Code Vein is an interesting foray into a world populated with Revenants who are basically vampires. The game possesses the best character creation that I have seen in any game. I spent more than 3 hours in character creation and had trouble starting the game because I had so many options to tweak and change. Only Soul Calibur character creation even comes close to the options available in this game.in terms of the game-play, the game allows for a variety of play-style options, whether you want to be a mage slinging powerful elemental spells or a two handed sword wielder who only uses magic to buff power or a lance wielder or axe-wielder or even a bayonet user, the game has got you covered with options.The game offers you various companions you can choose from to take into battle. The game difficulty is based on having a companion present so choosing to go it completely alone will make battles a lot harder. It will make certain bosses a huge pain to fight.As you may have heard, most people have been calling this game Anime Dark Souls and while there are some key similarities, Code Vein however manages to carve out it's own niche in the souls-like genre. The game presents the bulk of it's story in the form of vestiges, optional items you can find while exploring which give you flashbacks and insights into the characters of this game. The game has a variety of interesting and like-able characters, some of which are very multi-dimensional.Overall, this game is definitely something you should buy if you enjoy character creation, anime aesthetic, visceral combat and a twist on the souls formula.

Recommended,71.5,"																It is like Dark Souls, but accessible to the average gamer. The difficulty is toned down slightly, but don't get over confident else you'll be in for pound town. Coherent story. Quick gameplay. Easy to choose classes that are swapable.			"
Recommended,131.1,"																While I haven't finished the main game yet, I'm having all kinds of fun playing this game. I'd almost say that it's the best Souls-like title I've played. Take that with a grain of salt since I haven't played Nioh or Sekiro yet. Only thing that I could say is kind of a negative is that stats aren't explained all that well. Maybe I missed that explanation from the tutorial, but there's a lot of text boxes to go through in the tutorial.If you enjoy Souls-like combat and don't mind anime tiddies and waifus, definitely give it a shot. This might just be for you.			"

Recommended,17.7,"																I got one of the endings that I suppose most people will get, so I'll review the game based off that and I'll keep it simple:PROS:-One of the most detailed character creators I've ever seen period-Looks pretty damn good for a 3D anime game, I've seen people say it looks like ♥♥♥♥ and idk what they're talking about-Alot of combat customization-A lot more cutscene orientated than souls games (this will be divisive depending on if you like the laid-back style of souls storytelling or not)CONS:-Alot of uninspiring enemy types... You'll see alot of the same enemies by the 2nd or 3rd area...-Not alot of lore to explore. Areas, like enemies, are uninspired. Destroyed city, snow biome, desert biome, they aren't really interesting. Alot of the locations in souls have alot of history to them to find out, little to no lore here.-Non satisfying conclusion. This may change if I get any other endings... but I was not satisfied at all at where the story ended.OVERALL:Like it's been stated 1000 times, it's anime souls. You're either into it or not. If you like anime or souls, pick this up it was a good time overall. If you go in expecting souls level lore however, you will be sorely disappointed.			"
Recommended,35.4,"																CODE VEIN is a very good ""souls like"" game. Because of this, it is not simple and can cause some players not familiar with the genre. But this is not a big obstacle not to try to play it and finish it.Regarding the plot, it is very interesting for me and draws the person playing. The problem is the locations are very different but sometimes they like to repeat themselves in such a way that on the basis of one location another is built but in general the game is very good and interesting.Regarding music, it is great and atmospheric and stands out from the rest of the game. I just love her. But there is a problem here because my task of these pieces of music is definitely not enough and they often repeat themselves. Which slightly spoils the immersion of the game experience.Regarding control, it is good but I have some problems because it is quite not intuitive. Because of this, you have to learn for a long time and get used to it, but it is manageable and gives you much satisfaction later.What really sets this game apart is the character creator because it gives you infinite possibilities to create any character you want, in addition in the future there may be 3 DLC that will be included in the Season pass and which will not only add a new story but will also increase the character creator's possibilities . In general, the game has great potential, we will see how the developers will use it in the future and how CODE VEIN will develop today.The above opinion is a collection of my internal feelings about the game and the whole structure.Overall game rating 10 / 10			"

Recommended,58,"																Now that i've finished my first playthrough i think i owe this game a smol review. So it took me 49 hours, probably half of which were spent in the character customization menu, but that's not the point. I liked this game very much, from characters to, even if generic, pretty good story. I didn't expect so much out of Code Vein going into it, it has the story itself, some side quests, decent amount of exploring, and dungeons which are called Depths, you can find the latter on your journey and as rewards for completing the side quests. In my 49 hours i still have some side quests and 3 depths to go through, but i'm already set to doing 2nd and 3rd run to see 2 more endings, since i got the neutral one and very curious how the other ones turn out.    The game also has quite a bit for people who like collecting things, oh so much to collect, all shiny, all precious.TL;DR - highly recommended.THAT SAID, it would be great if i could actually play the whole game in co-op, without forced disconnects after beating a boss.

Recommended,75.4,"																Code Vein is one of the most fun games I've played recently with a great balance between difficulty and enjoyment.The game is an amazing entry to the souls-borne genre, with the partner system being a great way for players to ease into the mechanics of the genre. However, if you've already gone through the pain of Dark Souls and or Bloodborne, you can simply remove your partner for a greater challenge. The skill system within the game is very simple to pick up with great freedom to customize play style. The game gives you plenty of skills to experiment and the currency used to unlock them are easy to accumulate. The dungeons/areas do get exhausting but with the reasonable checkpoints within each area, you can take breaks easily.The cheesy anime dialogue can be a put off for some people but if you're use to that, there is a overall solid story within. Also, play the game with Japanese voice actors, I personally think their acting is much better compared to the English voices.Lastly, I just want to appreciate that Code Vein wasn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port and the devs spent time creating a great PC experience			"
Recommended,11.8,"																Its God Eater with back stabs!! Code Vein's combat is quite enjoyable. The multiple blood codes allow for various builds that not only keep the combat fresh, but also makes it unique in certain aspects.While there are few weapon types, individual weapons of the same type do have varying move sets and stats scaling, allowing for matching with different blood codes. The story is ok, and is something that heavily relies on preference, but personally I like it, although could have made it a bit darker. The storytelling of the backstories of the characters gave me some Valkyrie Profile vibes.I highly recommend this game, especially if you like build customization and/or God Eater.			"

Recommended,14.4,"																Definitely makes it to my list of best games of 2019!If you like micromanaging stats and amazing flexibility with fighting styles, this is the game for you.If you like love-able characters that give you a reason to care about them enough to watch their cut-scenes, this is the game for you.If you like a good challenge, this is the game for you.Character customization has a LOT of options and its just beautiful. The AI could do a slight improvement, because they can't slide down ladders or climb quickly like you, they take a long time to get to your side.I got jumped multiple times and I kept wondering where in the hell was my buddy Yakumo and turns out he was still halfway down the ladder, lol.The flaws that you may or may not care about, mostly about immersion:Towards the ending, it felt kind of rushed as there were an increased amount of static cut-scenes where characters just stood in one place and talked.The camera doesn't move, you can't see their expression, so it feels a bit, mm.. lazy.During vestige memory cut-scenes, the MC just walks through the paths, un-reacting to anything that happens.(ground shaking, blood being splattered out of nowhere) If the MC could react actively, it would definitely improve immersion.Overall rating: A solid 9/10			"
Recommended,11,"																Having just completed the story, I must say that this game really impressed me from start to finish. The story, while it starts off slow, is one of the major reasons I like this game as much as I do. While not particularly gripping like other games are, it tells its narrative rather well and, though some things could be expanded on, does sufficiently well in explaining the world around you. You play as a revenant who has lost nearly all of their memories, but bears within them a special power. Not only are you able to revitalize depleted mistles and dried-up bloodsprings, but you carry the ability to incorporate many different Blood Codes into your fighting style. There is a slew of skills, called Gifts, to acquire, and many of them can be mastered in order to incorporate their usage while using another Blood Code (though you do need to meet certain stat requirements, which is easy to work around). This helps to make building your character as versatile as it can be. Though gear is limited in terms of what is available, there are different variations of both weapons and Blood Veils (which act as both another form of attack and as your armor simultaneously), so you can choose different weapons to suit your playstyle. The character creation? Mm. Mwah. So friggin' good. While there aren't any sliders for things such as height, width, and bust size, the rest of what it has to offer has a satisfying amount of depth to me. I could just sit here playing with the character creator and not get bored, and I do love creating characters of varying appearances. Clothing is limited, but different parts of said clothing can be removed and colored, so you're not limited to what the initial clothing presets show. For example, you see an outfit you like, but it has too many belts? It's very likely that you can remove some of the excess belts. I've played a lot of games with character creation over the years, and the only two games that I can honestly say have a more in-depth character customization mechanic are Blade and Soul and Black Desert Online, both of which are MMOs. For what it offers, Code Vein's character creation system is wonderful, and could keep me entertained for hours by itself.The gameplay is more or less what you'd expect from something that's essentially part Soulsborne and part God Eater. It's relatively easy to learn and get used to, so go at your own pace. It's not as difficult as the Souls games are reputable for, but it also isn't an easy journey through the story. If you are not prepared for some of the enemies you'll encounter, prepare to feel the frustration build on (I'm looking at you, Silent White's Dual Boreal Brutes). It's not quite as ""git gud"" as, say, Dark Souls 1 is, but it definitely has its moments of difficulty, both genuine and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Overall, I'm not left unimpressed by the combat, and I genuinely enjoy some of the fights I get into.The soundtrack is lovely too, but I just wish they wouldn't play the same track over and over for when you're about to get into combat. I personally wish it changed for every area you're in, but you can't get 'em all, can you? Aside from that, I enjoy the soundtrack the game has to offer, but then again, what else can you expect when the main person behind it is none other than friggin' Go Shiina?My brain is fried at the moment, so I'll stop my review here. All in all, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge that isn't completely overwhelming, and a game that has a surprisingly good story to offer. I especially recommend this to anyone who loves the God Eater franchise, as there's a lot to love from both this game and God Eater. Would I recommend it at full price? Considering I pre-ordered the damn game and even got the Season Pass after it was released, I'd say yeah. Get it.[EDIT] Remember when I said this wasn't as difficult as Dark Souls was? Well, that's true for the base difficulty of the game, but after getting to the end, like Dark Souls, it allows you to start the story over, but it also asks if you want to start it over on the same difficulty or an enhanced difficulty where everything is harder. With the enhanced difficulty, however, while the enemy types and layouts are the same like Dark Souls, the difficulty spikes significantly, especially when you get to certain bosses. I just spent, like, 20 attempts on one of the bosses due to one of their attacks NOW being a one-hit kill. Does this change my overall review? Hell no. In fact, I'd say the fact that they leave the choice of difficulty to the player is a welcome change compared to the likes of Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin.			"
Recommended,34,"																This game needs a award for great music, its all i have to say about the music, it is beautiful, it has such a nice and golden tone sometimes in cutscenes and story-telling.im safe to say, im addicted to his game, not due to the gameplay and stuff, Just cause of the Story, Music and Characters.the gameplay was pretty fun in my opinion and was easy to ""master"" (if you can call it that?) only problem was that i only learned in a later session about some of the draining functions which were explained in the tutorial that i somehow forgot within minutes, so i would recommend maybe also if you're on pc like me change some of the keys to make it easier to master or use due to the game having right-shift as a key to use your gifts which was in my opinion, horrible. just straight out horrible, the key was hard to hit in some battles and basically got me killed, but it can be easily changed so it was not too bad later on when i changed the key to mouse5 which made it easier to use giftsabout the characters i have also nothing to complain, they had a good story, developed well and were fun to have around, they helped in everythingBetter Equipment - Check.Helpful Advice? - Check.Can Spot Things You Cant? - Check.the NPC's helped me alot by finding items or chest that i missed sometimes so it was great that they pointed it out and told me ""Hey..is that?"" with a marker on a mini map which was easy to spot afterwards.This game had me hooked till the very end, i would just recommend this game to anyone, even if you dont like anime but like dark souls-ish games, this would be good for those type of players.

Not Recommended,51.9,"																An excellent game, replicating the Soulsborne style to a satisfying degree with a phenomenal character creator and a lot of class variety and surprising depth to said classes too. Though the game suffers from the some issues such as environmental/level design that can become quite bland and samey as time goes on I believe that the positives far outweigh the negatives.The story is also pretty good, not the best I've ever seen but still very enjoyable despite.A solid game and as such, an easy recommendation.

Recommended,32.5,"																First off, if you expect this game to give you a somewhat similar experience to Dark Souls, it won't. Code Vein is more of a modern hack and slash combat, that is in my opinion more fast pace, with significantly less depth in story and overall map design. My review can be a little bias off Dark Souls but I will be as fair as possible. I will make my conclusion short: The BASE GAME itself is good, recommend grabbing when on sale still. DO NOT BUY DLCs unless it's on a major big discount. DLC barely have anything to do with the main story plus it only a repeat experience.+ Really neat graphic. + Fast pace combat that is rather easy to learn + Pretty neat character customization (I really wish there is more option for base hair) + Can choose to go with partner for easier experience (can turn off their chatting voice if that annoys you) - If you already play Dark Souls, this game offer less depth and story driven experience, generic story. - There is a tediously long way of just pure walking between the transition of the maps that MAKE NO SENSE, and really annoying even though you only need to walk through them once. - Really disappointing DLCs .... I was forgiving for the Hellfire Knights one, but they keep rinsing and repeating for the 2 other DLCs, which make it overall an uninterested experience. The map itself is acceptable despite the mechanic is basically a bigger depth area. While I'm not picky on the boss itself, I would love to see them introduce new mobs at the very least ... 			"
Recommended,8.1,"																After a good 18 hours of play i will say this , code vein is one of my new favorite games , The story is amazing , really well written and alot of twist and actually made me cry , the difference in difficulty with or without NPC is amazing , its either you want a challenge or do you want easy mode ? , characther creation is one of THE best that i have seen in so long in a game like this. Parries and backstab are pretty damn cool, Bloodveils actualy looks cool , Blood Type is REALLY neat for different builds , It as alot of + but also alot of - . SO the bad now , The parry in this game , is REALLY weird i tried to parry for a while and i dont know the window is really weird, ALOT of game breaking bugs , alot of times my game BROKE and i had to *no clip* throught a door to ACTUALY progress , i am sure they will fix it soon enough , but it really sucks. Ennemies are somewhat of the same everywhere but with like a different skin and abilities , i would have love to see different type of Losts but lore wise , i can let it go easily. not alot of varieties in weapons , i do enjoy the few weapon we have , but i would have love to see maybe like two handed daggers for a faster build , or maybe like different type of ranged weapon . maybe with dlc they will fix that , i am def gonna buy the season pass tho.Other than that , i think code vein is a one of the game i Recommend playing over seeing someone play , when i saw someone play i was ""Eh it looks OKAY"" but when i played it i actualy LOVED it , Altho i hated that Wannabe Anor Londo it had in the game it was soo damn confusing . Other than that , i would say don't come in the game expecting a Souls like experience , They did alot of things different , and they did alot of things Right , Code vein deserve your attention and money !

Recommended,3.9,"																Code vein pushes all my buttons. I've never been really into Dark Souls. Not because of the difficulty, but because I enjoy games where the story is more in the forefront rather than on the fringes. I want to be TOLD a story, not find a story. In this respect, Code Vein excels. It is a pretty Anime tropey story, but I am okay with that because what it does it does well. The story is a little bit Dark Souls, a little bit God Eater (but way more polished) and Maybe a smidge Ninja gaiden and Castlevania near the end. I dug it and I look forward to a sequel.Another thing I liked about the story is that the item collecting is also directly connected to more story. the more vestiges you collect, the more you learn about the characters. I dug it.(for the record, I admire what Dark Souls does...a plot that you have to figure out on your own. I don't mind clues regarding subplot, mysteries, characters, etc, but I want to be told my main narrative.)			"
Recommended,27.3,"																This is my first souls-like game and to be honest I'm not very interested in the souls-like genre, but after seeing that Code Vein has the same developer as God Eater, I really want to try it.And yes, this game is very enjoyable with a companions system that is very helpful when you want to explore the area or fight a boss. Very cool and very detailed character creations (I hope GE can be detailed as this game too) :'>also the story of this game is quite interesting and full of mystery.

Recommended,68.6,"																Code Vein is anime Dark Souls with a great story and even better combat, without most of the overly obnoxious and annoying Souls trappings. Character customization is insane, the maps and music are pretty and on point, and the companion system makes the game feel lively at all times as the characters are very well fleshed out and likable.On the whole, it's the perfect game for people who want to play a casual Souls game and just have fun with it :)			"
Recommended,14,"																Again a game I am happy I did not listen to any review on YOUTUBE or the like of IGN etcLots of fun an interesting  anime like soul  a good story sure it not the story of the year but then again you have to understand they are 3 different ending (which many are ignorant of since you are not lead by the nose) depending on the choice /action you make ;therefore the story has to be flexible as well  The player is given a lot of choice and flexibility. It encourages you to experiment with different build and weapon mix and match ''gifts'' , without being   held by the hand during the process , there is no actual meta you can finish the game using pretty much every build. Code Vein has a character creator that many devs should absolutely learn from. You can  spend hours on end creating characters and you simply just don't tire of it because of the possibilities and can still be exploited further which I highly encourage (ex: like the ability to have 2 different hair color vertically that one example of the top of my head that could be added). If the first play through was too easy (which it will most likely be for some) when you restart you can chose to increase the difficulty on your new game+ and if that still not difficult enough go ahead and  play without ally.Looking forward for a more in depth multi player experience. This game has potential for more and definitely deserves a sequel.			"

Be mindful of the clipping thou,2nd thing, this being my first souls like game this is kinda hard at first, this aint Monster Hunter World, but then again, git gud. The bosses arent really that hard after the poledancer girl.and what made me stay, is the way they presented the lore, in pieces of Vestige. Fragments of memories scattered all around this blood thorn world.Had some problems with the keybindings if you're on keyboard and mouse, had to use my own keymap, Still having problems trying to parry/backstab even after 24 hours in. Learning that might make the game easier, but I'm pulling through without it.Oh yeah, they have a hotspring in game, you get to chill there in just a towel and oogle around on other NPCsThe game does have a fair balance of sizes if you know what i mean :lenny:Would be worth your money even without being on sale, swipe that card, and make sure you keep your heart safe.

Recommended,6.3,"																Am going for the NG+2 later. This game is indeed a fun and challenging game with a mystery that keep making me play it (probably coz i just want to get all the achievements).|Quick review:Code Vein is an anime version of Dark Souls but it took place in the ""God Eater universe"".Do i recommend it?Yes.|A bit longer review:Aside from the issues such as the random crashes and frame drops, the game runs well on my mid-high 1050Ti setup. The graphic settings are quite in-depth but weird at the same time coz sometimes the cutscenes were rendered as if i put it on low settings.The story is a short one but it's filled with anime tropes (duh). Enjoyable and it does give me some of the feels that the writers wanted me to feel. Returning to it on the NG+ to explore the different ending made me feel even more feels.The design of the characters, NPCs and the enemies shows a great continuation of the lore. It's also very unique coz i've never seen gas masks being used for a blood-related air toxicity. The character creation mode is maybe the main thing that attracts people into the gamebutit's not that good. The game does present you with a lot of stuff to build your character but it's also very little in terms of what you can build from it. Some hair parts are considered as accessories and there's a limit to what you can make out of the ""hair parts and extensions"". Those parts are limited by accessory slots (e.g. one side hair extension costs about 4 accessory slots. You only have 12 slot values for accessories). The outfits that you can choose to equip is also very limited. There's not much of it and you can't customize much with it. And that's a bummer.Then the game disappointed me by not carefully hiding the spoilers. I can already know what's gonna happen around the ending just from playing the early introduction parts. The world design is very, very similar as the God Eater's (and the game might be in the same universe as the God Eater. There's too much clues all around).This game is a Souls-likebutthe enemies are far more unforgiving of your mistakes. No matter how high your defense values are, they can still kill you in about 3 to 4 hits especially if you got staggered. Plus your early game ""Estus"" is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥. After you got it to +6 (max value) and a combination of a Blood Code's Gift that it became a really decent ""Estus"".The parry is a bit weird as well. Some Blood Veils are fast with a very small window while others are slower and kinda baited the enemies into it. This is about the same for the backstab mechanics. You have to aim between the back of the enemy and the right leg to get it to work coz most of the enemy (all of them i think) are right-handed. Nevertheless, i'm pretty sure that's just me being noob at it. Will git gud soon.You can bring along a companion with you to help you with your grind. When they're good, they're really good. When they suck, they really suck. There's also the online co-op matchmaking that works almost similar to Monster Hunter World's SOS signal function. You can launch a signal and you can respond to it from different players. The issue i have with it is the other side is always laggy. If you paired with a friend, then one of you died, it's gonna take a long time to get connected to each other again.Collecting different Blood Codes will grant you some quality variations on your build which i really enjoy testing stuff out to find a set that suits my playstyle. Some abilites are exclusive to their Blood Codes but you can carry over the ability to enable it to be used while equipping a different Blood Code. It's a great way to let players experiment on how to be the badass Revenant in the game. You can build a hybrid build to ease your way to clear the map.Some of the buff items are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my opinion as they lasted less than 10 seconds sometimes. You'll need to enhance it by equipping a Gift that will extend the effects of said buff items to make it actually decent and there's a lot of them for you to choose. Basically, without any enhancement the items might not work best in dire situations. Stock them in your storage whenever you can coz you don't want to run out of it while being away from the Home Base.In conclusion,i really enjoy playing the game despite all the issues with it. The experience of learning how to git gud is enjoyable for me. I will explore everything the game can offer to me coz i bought the season pass. So there better be more content coming or i'll be pissed.I would recommend the game for Dark Souls fans and newcomers alike. It's a good game to experience.|p.s.: Io best waifu			"
Recommended,2.1,"																Having now completed the game and with 44 hours under my belt, I can confidently tell you that Code Vein is more than just anime Dark Souls. Calling it such a thing would be disregarding so many of the unique things the game does, from its story to its Blood Codes and companions. The world of Vein is intricately detailed and, though set in a tumultuous post-apocalypse, still manages to be beautiful and threatening at the same time. The enemies are varied enough to provide you with enjoyable fights and the bosses each manage to be unique in their own way - though some are a little less fulfilling than others. The story, at first, seems to follow the usual anime trope of 'the power of friendship conquers all' but as it continues, it develops into something much deeper, with connections to other Bandai Namco titles. Speaking of the story, Code Vein does something most games fail to with their stories, they prefer to show, rather than tell. An example of this being the memory sequences, as well as a particular level you experience later on in the game that is heavily tied in with both the story of your character as well as the story of the world itself. The gameplay of Vein is sometimes just a slight bit clunky, but addictive all the same. Exploring the levels has actual purpose and is extremely satisfying with all the unique loot that can be found in the nooks and crannies of the Veil. The companions system adds to this satisfying gameplay and makes each fight feel a little more fair. I actually felt confident whenever I saw a large group of enemies in the distance, because I knew that my companion would be there to back me up in case things went south. Blood Codes open up a huge range of builds and customisation for your playstyle, and though a little daunting to learn about at first, are insanely fun to mix and match with. Speaking of customisation, once again, Bandai delivers a top notch character creator. I spent the first hour of this game perfecting my character, the sheer amount of detail that you can put into your character is amazing, and is something I am very grateful to Bandai for.Basically, Code Vein is a satisfying, well written and well developed game, and though sometimes a little clunky, can provide you with hours of fun and things to do.If I had to rate the game, I would give it a 9/10. Some may call this too much, but I personally believe this game has earned such a rating.			"

DON'T BELIEVE THEM.Code Vein is Souls-like game and it did its great job as one of Souls-like should be.NOT completely Dark Souls : Yeah, Code Vein has Souls like gameplay(with anime characters, why not.) but there're many different things that souls game doesn't have.Code Vein is more friendly with player, but at the same time Code Vein also give challenges to player.The Mix of both make this game surprisingly fun.Replayable : Love to carry what you do to NG+? Don't worry. it's has multiple endings so you need to finish it atleast 3 - 4 times to understand all story (without reading reddit)Good Performance : You can spend a day long with Code Vein. It's work smoothly. I used to have UE game crashes once around my first 20 hours but it's only once so I give it good.Well, That's all for me to recommend this game. I'm not gonna spoil you fun anymore. Code Vein is the new taste you should try it yourself!P.S. Thank you for reading and sorry for bad english.			"
Recommended,29.9,"																Great game.Story : Good story overall, nice twists and turns and interesting world. Characters having theirs memories in something called ""Vestige"". This is where you learn about their stories, origins, development .. and its done in a good way ""8.5/10""Gameplay : At first you might think its a simple gameplay with nothing new but when it come to choose ""classes and techniques"" this is where the gameplay really shine. You can find a lot of different combinations to defeat ennemies.You can play as a tank, healer, dps, mage and others. Few weapons but they have unique mooveset and gears can affect the way you moove. So between class, technique, weapon and gear... choose wisely. ""9/10""Audio : Epic. ""9/10""Design : I think its the weak point of this game, characters looking good (really good avatar creation by the way first hard boss) but the world looks just okay to me not bad not good ""6/10""Overall : ""8.1/10""Notes : Difficulty : You can choose to fight alone or with a partner. I choose to play alone most of the time and especialy against bosses, i got stuck on one during 4 hours straight (maybe im just bad) so if you search for hard challenges you will be served. Map : You will have to look closely to find theirs secret passages			"
Recommended,68.5,"																I personally was hyped about this game when it was first announced and tbh, I was more than sad as it got a year of delay. Nevertheless, I expected a good game that's likable and that gets me into these kind of soul games and I was NOT disappointed. This game is one of the most beautiful experiences I had in single player games and the story, the ideas and the characters were just estonishing. I can't wait for the DLCs and for more! Bandai Namco, you did an amazing job!			"
Recommended,21,"																Highly recommend if you are a fan of souls like games.Plays basically the same with a few new features and changed. Took around 40 to 50 hours to complete the game with all the side content. Plus you have a great character creation to mess around with and make whatever you want. I would highly recommend playing without the AI partners as I feel like they are too powerful but they are good for people not as experienced in these types of games.			"
Recommended,34.8,"																It's a fun game, it becomes even better after some hour.What I liked:1) SountracksThe sountrack is really cool, it is one of those thing that made me enjoying this title.2) Blood Code systemBlood Code system (Blood Code=Classes) is really good, it makes you create your own class mixing different skills to make your favorite build.3) Many weapons and armorsThe good thing is that they are different to each other (how they look), even if they are not so different in term of stats, for that, you can transform them to make them unique. That's something you still saw in other games, nothing special but still good.But, I have to say that I didn't like something about this game:1) Co-opI don't know why they made a co-op similar to Dark Souls co-op, damn that co-op is awful, they could do something better (for example something like to ""Remnant from the Ashes"").2) AnimationsThere are not so many bad animations, but some of them look like they came from 1 or 2 generations ago (running animation is just bad, it looks like they are running on ice). 3) Story and side-storiesThe Story is just boring, and the sections where you have to walk look cool for a while, but when you realize that you are going to do that for many times you'll get tired very quickly.I give a positive review because I'm having fun whit this game, and that's the most important thing.But, I'd say to wait for a price drop (or just look some gameplay/review). It's a good game but I don't know if it is worth full price.			"

Recommended,30.2,"																Well, then. I've been playing this from hours on end for a while, and seems like I'm near the end so I feel now is a good time to write this._The gameplay is definetly souls-like, in which diffculty is high, but it's still very much approachable to not so good players. I struggle a lot with shouls games, typically taking around 5-6 tries per boss, and in this one they normally fall at the 2nd time. Except the second boss. ♥♥♥♥ that one.-Combat is much more centered around your ""gifts""(skills) selected, adn the ""Blood Code"" (Class) you choose. Both can be swaped around anytime, giving you total freedom to make your own build.-Plot wise, not much. Tipycal hero's journey. But Characters... Ah, that's were is at. You'll be hard pressed to find one you don't like.-My only gripe with the game is that the multiplayer is kinda wonky to play with friends due to not really clear rules of ""when two people can go together"", and the only moment it's really a good moment for multiplayer is right in front of the boss, since you cant use mitsle (the bonfires of this game) while having another player in.All in all, a great experience with multiple NG+ opportunities due to having multiple endings.			"
Recommended,4,"																I would recommend it to everyone that likes the souls like genre... if you like the anime part. Its sort of integral to it, and is one of the main charms. If you are meh about animu themes and waifus, I would generally advise against buying it.			"
Recommended,141.8,"																As someone who loves playing soulsborne games but struggles immensely this game is absolutely amazing. I still struggle but the struggle doesn't feel nearly as bad.

Recommended,48.3,"																Code Vein is a very good - if slightly flawed - soulsesque title that (with it's *true* ending) left me personally wanting for more.While it is heavily inspired by other soulslike titles it manages to give the formula it's own spin with both the Blood Code system as well as your (optional) AI companion. A few things that stood out for me:++ Blood Code system: basically classes that provide you with different stat-scalings that you can change on the fly (even mid-combat!). You can use almost each classes' skills (both active and passive) on every other class once you unlock them. It allows for a large variety in builds and I didn't use the same set of skills for every class I ended up playing. ++ AI companion: Some people might see that as a negative, but for me it was a nice change to have an actually very competent partner by your side. You can, however, also play the entire game alone. (with the exception of the first bossfight, where you'll have to have a partner)++ Character creation: Let's just say I wish every game had a character creator like this. It's vast & allows for a large amount of variety, but accesory costs are a bummer (but apparently have been fixed with CE) and clipping can be rampant.  ++ Co-op. Always a plus. Not as neatly done as in say Remnant, but still fairly enjoyable. -- lock-on seems kinda weird at times and the combat can feel a little bit floaty-- while there's a decent variety in general level aesthetic, they're somewhat bland in their own zone-- a little too many ""ambushes"" - which kinda takes away from the whole ""ambush"" aspect-- I wish there were more weapon types. There's a decent amount of movesets in each weapon class, but it's still just five types overall. Now, beware, though: The game is undoubtedly ""anime"" and you'll find anime tropes all over the place. If you're somewhat hardened to them / or enjoy them, you'll probably end up liking the story, even if it starts very, very slow, but it does build up and it has a very nice twist to it near the end, one that left me personally hoping for a sequel.If you don't like anime, you can skip almost all cutscenes/memory sequences but you'll still have to deal with the aesthetics/character design.Overall though, Code Vein is a very enjoyable experience 			"
Recommended,35.1,"																Pros+ Has the Dark Souls formula that fits well for its' combat system.+ Customization is vast to make you feel like you can immerse yourself or cosplay as an anime character.+ A variety of Blood Veils (armor) and weapons as well as Blood Codes (classes you can receive or find if you explore).+ Exploration does help in the long run when challenging areas or hard hitting bosses.+ Bosses give that sense of false confidence. Trust me, people say it's easy mainly because of their companions or use stagger weapons (the big two handed ones) and the bosses feeling like normal enemies you can walk around and backstab alot. Wait until you reach the fifth area where the learning curve spikes and your companions become incompetent and you need to change your strategy. Bosses do hit hard (to the point of one shotting even with a good build) and they will not have backstab chances.+ Builds. There are a good amount of blood codes (classes) with their unique gifts that if you master, you can implement them into other blood codes to create a build suited to your playstyle. Support Gifts, Offensive Gifts or Gimmick Gifts offer many styles of play. It just takes a bit of experimenting with loadouts.+ Story has that God Eater progression that if you feel invested or immersed into the characters or world, you'll find yourself in tears. Character building is great and unique in the form of Vestiges that you can find and traverse the companion's memories to unlock their gifts in their blood codes.Cons- Companions will be a hit or miss. Sometimes they do the incredible in situations needed and dire and other times you can't help but wonder what the hell they are doing as you are dying or fighting a boss. I personally have had companions be incompetent with me more than competent.- Leveling is on a letter system based on your armor, weapons and gifts. You cannot invest into one stat to increase it. It only helps Health Pool, Stamina and weapon attack. Defense is loosely based on your Blood Veil and it feels like even the heaviest blood veil doesn't offer much protections.- Not enough variety in customization. I personally feel that even with the amount of customization you can do, it's not enough. your accessories have a cost bar that will limit accessories. I guess to make people not go overboard with it and ruin their fps or something (speaking of the game runs a smooth 60 fps) and clothing options are minimal. You cannot mix and match clothes.- Multiplayer doesn't feel as rewarding. Sure you may get that ""Yay, I helped!"" or ""Awww, we failed. Next time though."" and an item that increases your companion rank and some haze, you don't get much of anything else.- Movement is a little clunky in battle and exploration. I've found my character sliding just a little when he comes to a stop from a casual jog or walk. And when battling, I'm trying to dodge one way and my character for some odd reason doesn't respond to the direction and instead dodges in the direction he is facing (happens alot when you are locked onto a boss or enemy and trying to get around them.)The game is actually pretty good and I feel that most anime games need to explore more gameplay options rather than stick with RPG or Arena Battlers. (Yes I know, there are many other forms anime games can take, I just personally feel that the anime games currently are more focused on character battle royal and grind heavy arpgs or rpgs.) I DO have a couple of issues with Multiplayer.Multiplayer is ""lacking"" I would say. I don't know if most people know how to send distress signals or they are just too reliant on companions. I've tried it with randoms and friends and I can say you have much better chances with friends than randoms. Don't get me wrong, I do not fault the decision of the host I join. If they make a bad decision, I try to help them out of it (but this usually involves both of us dying). Now sometimes, there is a bit of sacrifice of health needed to keep each other alive. The gift you get from the start of the game allows you to heal your partner if they go down, bringing them back from the brink of death. I can say, don't expect the other person to use it much. It comes down to both of you trying to survive for yourself and that in most cases can lead to a quick death. (Thankfully, the host can still have an AI companion that can spend their health freely on both of you if they are competent enough.) Sadly, if the host feels that you did a terrible job, they will just cancel you before you can even do anything. Loading is also bugged when joining. I've found myself joining but not loading in and other times you get stuck on a black screen for a bit before the game crashes. I have an idea for a simple addition to multiplayer that won't make it a bugged system. Instead of P2P invest in a server or few (seriously, this game sold well enough to do so.) They could also try to make an item that can be on par with Dark Souls soapstones. Like have your character drop down a bit of their blood in a sign of their blood code currently running and this will allow the hosts to pick and choose their partners rather than getting someone they feel is ""bad"". Also, they should have more reward options for helping others rather than title and icon changes. (That's really all you get for helping.) I want to help people and have fun, make new friends if I can through the multiplayer, but as of what it stands, it needs alot more work and thought put into it. All in all, this game is fun and worth its' price.			"

Not Recommended,28.6,"																Quick SummaryThis game is not for Dark Souls enthusiasts, maniacs and elitists. If you're considering buying this game, I highly recommend you know what you're buying first. The gameplay is mediocre when compared to Dark Souls. There are flaws here and there. However, the game's selling point is the story and the Anime-like style gameplay.Story  WARNING : The game story is depressing. If you have a faint heart or depression, do NOT play this game.Overall the game is great in terms of story. The story is depressing. In a game where a character and a very untimely death to someone so young will be depressing. I do not recommend the game for those who have depression. This game isn't bright sunshine and rainbows. The game's message of the story is to treasure your memories. It what makes you, you.Gameplay This game is [Dark Souls + God Eater = Code Vein.]It's every God Eater graphics, art style, and directive from that game mixed in with the Dark Souls style of gameplay, depressing story and map designs. Dark Souls players will be hit by nostalgia. Everything down to the parrying system and the weapon mechanics are exactly similar to Dark Souls. Trust me when I say this, it is a LOT like Dark Souls.			"
Recommended,65.4,"																First off, the music is great. Unlike Dark Souls, this games is much more focused on story than difficulty. Walking through characters' backstories was a great way to flesh out their personalities and relations to some of the bosses. Overall, the story was pretty interesting. Sadly most of the boss fights were easy and anti-climatic since most of them are easy to stun lock, even some of the standard enemies proved to be more difficult than the bosses. Most of the enemies are just retextures of others, hardly any new enemies are introduced throughout the game. Combat seems a little bland since it's easy to stun lock most things. I'd like to say that having gifts makes up for this, but they're pointless most of the time since it's easy to stun lock enemies. The story was a decent length. It's a decent game I guess.Thought the DLC was gonna be ♥♥♥♥, glad I didn't buy them.			"
Recommended,11.8,"																Code Vein isn't a perfect game.The combat feels a little floaty, and the balance feels off in several places.However, the game has so much heart, and does so many things differently from the usual Souls games, that it still manages to score pretty high in my books. I don't think the level design is as horrible as some make it out to be, and the sheer amount of customization in builds and character appearance is pretty insane.If you wanna feel like a ""badass"" anime protag', this is the game for you. Just don't go in expecting some bootleg Dark Souls. Play the game for what it tries to do on its own. I'm sure you'll have a blast then.Note: the OST in this game is underrated.

Without the companion(s) the difficulty very much resembles that of the Souls series. The combat system feels smooth and there are lots of options for character customization (appearance wise AND build wise). The rush events can be challenging, the secrets well hidden and the boss fights might take a few (lol) tries.There are tons of bloodlines/abilities to unlock and combine AND lots of weapons to try out (some with cool special moves like in Souls). If you enjoy a Souls-like playstyle with lots of possibilities, anime and waifus with back-pain due to their enormous personalities and/or husbandos this might be the game for you.			"
Recommended,9.2,"																 The 3rd Playthrough I have trouble putting this game down.--I've completed this game 3 times to see every ending and I thoroughly enjoyed Code Vein for it's challenging mechanics, boss fights, the added twist of ability usage and the story. Pros - Character customization.- NPC co-op.   - Special abilities.- Camera shoot mode (lets you take game photos with added filters, angle rotation etc).- High emphasis on story.-  Connection with the God Eater series.  - Safe to mod. (If you want those cosmetics, It's not a bannable offence).    Cons That being said. After my 2nd playthrough I picked up Dark Souls and noticed a few things that could be improved for this game.- The camera can be a nightmare in close quarters. Often the enemies that were lower to the ground when close would snap the camera almost straight down and bosses rather large straight up. It's worse if you're against a wall where it will zoom in.- The lock on system can also act troublesome. The DLC bosses are a good example. Enemies that are too large only target the head or chest. Meaning when you attempt to dodge roll. You either roll into a leg or into the attack. It would be better if you could lock onto the hind legs instead.- Control input can be delayed, When locked onto a target you might want to sprint away because dodge rolling doesn't get you far enough during a 3-5 hit combo. You'll hold the sprint button down but when locked on and it won't kick in for a couple of seconds.- If your guard is up and you hit that roll button. It may not activate. It will if you drop the guard and then roll.   - You cannot run with guard up. - DLC: Short. No real story. Mild fan service to those who played God Eater and is over priced.  This is probably the one con that actually bothered me. The rest you can pay no mind to due to how limited and insignificantly they actually effect the game.      Closing If you play games for story more than anything else, like myself. I highly, highly recommend playing the God Eater series too (At the very least [GE1]:resurrection and GE2: Rage Burst). I won't spoil anything. But trust me. It will be worth it.I look forward to a sequel \o/			"

As a western gamer I love the exploration, combat, simplicity, and customization and as an anime and JRPG fan I love everything else. It is NOT a Dark Souls clone with things tacked on for no reason. It's different in the right ways. Everything is deliberate and it doesn't have the same flaws as most JRPGs.

Recommended,32.1,"																CODE VEIN is a game I had very high hopes for as soon as I heard the GOD EATER team was making a soulslike, and I'm happy to report that the game meets and exceeds those high hopes. Game is very good, and I'm probably about to turn around and play through again to get the other endings.Positives: Just about everything, really? I don't have many complaints. I quite liked GOD EATER and i really love this game. Being able completely switch your stats any time by equipping a different blood code let me mess around with many different playstyles whenever I wanted and that's always a good feeling. Negatives: There were a couple rather rude difficulty spikes that felt bad to run into for the first time. Additionally, at the time of this writing the multiplayer seems to only let you connect to other people in the same steam download region as you, which sucks and I hope they fix it.Yes, it is very anime, but unless you're absolutely determined to have all your soulslike experiences totally untainted by anime (which is BS, because dark souls is totally anime), I highly recommend CODE VEIN.			"
Not Recommended,29.6,"																pretty solid game, and character customization is incredible. i'm extremely reluctant to label any game as ""soulslike"", but if you're familiar with the dark souls series then you really will feel right at home here. it's hard not to compare the two, seeing as how so many mechanics within this game have been blatantly copied from DS (souls as exp and currency aka ""haze"", co op summoning aka ""distress signals"", and you will see plenty of ""does not open from this side"" and ""this contraption is not working"" and elevators with buttons in the center of the floor, etc etc.) Still, though this game is soulslike, it is not a souls game. That is both a good thing and a bad thing, as soulslike games are typically very good but if you are a veteran of the ""bloulskiro"" (ugh) franchise, then a lot of the mechanics and features might feel like cheap imitations and knockoffstl;dr, overall a very good game, though that may be because they literally put an anime skin over a dark souls game.

Recommended,51.6,"																Don't let the game's aesthetic fool you. There's a heartwarming story about humanity and memories here beneath the edgy exterior, and it's told in interesting, if initially confusing, ways. It's not the best story you'll ever read, but it's far from the worst. Pay attention and you'll find that what is initially confusing gives way quickly to an interesting world and some fun, if a bit predictable, characters.Moment to moment gameplay is strong, and veterans of Souls games or Nioh will feel right at home. The primary draw here is the expansive degree of customization you have for your class. Pulling passives and actives from others and mixing it with the ones native to your class on the fly almost whenever you want is an excellent way to give the player a way to tailor the experience exactly to their liking and there's no such thing as class regret here - if it's not for you, change it out.Levels start simple and gradually grow and spread out until they become the reason the mini-map uses a breadcrumb trail. Locations are, similarly, initially simple and largely run of the mill, but become gradually more grandiose or otherwise flavorful.Outside of a few very bad cases, enemy design is strong and engaging, and the game is never above dishing out damage that wipes half or more of your HP away. Bosses, similarly, are almost all excellent experiences that gradually ramp up in difficulty and complexity, and a few really shine through as standout fights in this genre. There are some incredible 1v1 fights (provided you're not bringing AI or friends along) that always had me rushing back to the boss on death, ready to go again, the death counter hitting double digits be damned. There's a few duds, but nothing that left me frustrated at anyone but myself over my own lack of ability - with the exception of one fight that, after two dozen attempts, left me feeling like deliberately choosing to play the game alone was a detriment, not an option.Which brings me to cooperative play. Code Vein is very clearly designed from the ground up with player doing things with a buddy or an AI partner (a shockingly competent AI partner at that.) While ~95% of my playthrough was done solo, I used the AI to clear out a few Depths maps (picture Chalice Dungeons from Bloodborne) and to bulldoze two bosses I got fed up with - one for feeling like it was made for two people and the other because the run back was nearly three minutes. Playing solo is deliberately choosing to make the game more difficult, but it shocks me how massive the jump between solo and coop is. That's not to say this game is the hardest ever, but rather that the coop run-through must feel almost like auto-pilot. The AI is so strong and adept at staying alive that they can busy themselves with a boss or pack of enemies while you watch and occasionally poke in. This is important because (major story spoiler follows): the final boss requires you to bring the AI along if you want the best ending, and after seeing the final boss, I feel like I've been robbed of one of the best fights in the game.Overall, Code Vein is worth it. I would definitely recommend it, full price if you're a fan of the genre, on sale if you're unsure or don't know if you want to play a game with a lot of anime tiddies in it.			"

Recommended,109.5,"																Another Game enters the nebulous Souls-Like-Genre.TL;DR: I would recommend this games to many people. But not if you expect the absolute maximum Challenge a NG+10 Dark Souls offers. Go to Sekiro for this. Code Vein is easier but fun.Now some Pros and Cons, though everything comes with an asterisk attached.Pros:- Character Editor: It is very free in terms of style. And you can even change a lot after you started the game, something that isn't normal nowadays.- No Microtransactions: Very relaxing that it is just a straightforward single/co-op experience.- Unique skills and class systems: You can change Classes on a whim and even use skills from other calsses you have mastered. Very free form.- Exceptional Story: I usually don't like Animestories that much anymore but this is a really engaging if not sometimes confusing story, with memorable Characters, that sometimes fall into the trappings of tropes, but they are good executed tropes.- Interesting Style: This game is so unapologetically edgy and i love it.- Unique Gameplay: This game has very unique Gameplay. Up to 8 Skills can be equipped at any time and there is a long list to choose from, all of them change the way you play significantly. I would describe it as a blend of Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma. Cons:- Classprogression lack some depth: I am a bit two-minded about this one. On one hand it streamlines a lot, but on the other hand it really limits your character expression, which can be detremental to your ability to create a lot of diverse characters buildwise. Not to say it is bad, just a taste issue for me, i love making a lot of diverse builds.- Sometimes confusing and long winded: The story is great, but it sometimes breaks up to much of the gameplay. Though you can easily skip every cutscene if you want.- Lacks some polish: Self explanatory.- It is somewhat hard to get into: Now the Gameplay feels very clunky, at the beginning. It has it's own tempo and feel to it. Something i had a hard time with at first but after a few hours (3~5) i really got into it.			"
Recommended,141,"																-It's a hack and slash spin on the souls genre, enemies are placed to assassinate you, and bosses still hit hard enough to murder you, but hacking and slashing is perfectly viable with the right build-It isn't dark souls, except when it is-The OST IS AMAZING. Code Vein feels like a well done AA game but it's as if the composer didn't care and gave it the extremely high AAA soundtrack experience.-Bouncing Anime Tiddies, both on you, NPC's, and bosses...you either love it (like anime fans do) or hate it (like the game journos do)-The story is VERY ANIME but takes a bit to get going.-Great character creation, no Pay2LookCute in a single player (can be co-op) game.

Recommended,13.9,"																This game is definitely worth the price & your time. No bugs at all, its super clean and finished up. The start could be a bit rought for new players (in Souls like games) but after you learn the basic mechanics of the game you are set to have fun for hours and hours. 8/10 so far- My First run took me 26 Hours to finish - Bosses are pretty easy (except one duo, that duo took me while to kill) - The whole game is pretty easy until the last 3 Locations.- Minimap is super useful, even tho sometimes it could be a bit confusing to find your path. - Art style is nice - The length of the game is on spot. Not Short, Not Long- Cool Story & Side Quests One thing that i’d add is more dungeons or add randomly generated dungeons (Bloodborne style) - The basic game has only 6 dungeons			"

Recommended,58.6,"																This is going to be a review after completing the story with the ""Best Ending"" and 100% all the zones+depths.  Got the game as gift, accident buy.  I will try to omit all the spoilers if possible.  Will do a TLDR version first then the ""Long version"" after.  I have also played all 3 souls game BB+Demon so that may factor in. Cons will be longer because nitpicks don't lets this deter you if you were planning to buy the game anyways,  If your on the fence the cons might help you determine if it is an important issue for you.TLDRPros:-Dark Soulslike (C'mon it's BanCo)-Fun Character Creator-Anime Waifu Material-Anime aesthetic-Great premise/story-Co-op friendly-Great ""showoffy"" moves-Decent amount of content and mix and match skill managementNeutral:-American voice acting and chemisty can be iffy (can effect story delivery)-Graphics seems ""downgraded"" from pre-release footage but could just be me-No shields or helmets-Lacking clothing/male hair/accessories slot seems a bit low would love to be able to increase the cap-Odd clipping ""missing textures"" on some outfit combos-not souls level of hard imo (can be seen as good and bad depending)-Game feels short maybe I just adjusted quickly.Cons:-Little easy in some areas with AI+Co-op partner. -I feel like there is a bit of artificial difficulty in some ""normal encounters"" not so much the bosses other then 1 where they give you no room to even dodge lol.-some skills/gifts seem to have redundant abilities-No easy way to swap out partner-some characters are very one-dimensional-preorder skill is useless lategame (at least for me)-randomly laggy to crashing mid boss fight not often thoughTip:Don't level early if you want to max out gifts.  At the start  your partner    Louis is a better DPS but Yakumo can take more hits and offer you a defense buff (Yakumo tends not to heal you though so Louis beginning bits imo) TLDRTLDR: Anime Bobs+waifus Good Game Good buy would. A E S T H E T I CLong Review:Alright so I completed this game around the 20 hour mark while watching all cutscenes seems a bit low for this type of game while still 100% the areas and getting the ""good ending""  I feel like I can possibly cut the time with a normal run at 12 hours?  Who knows I'm not going to try as I enjoyed what I was able to play through.  I would imagine getting the other 2 endings will increase this play time to maybe 40-50 hours skipping cutscenes.I think the shorter then expected time to completion is due to all skills being able to be seen allowing you to outright pick and choose which skills you want to use.  Blacked out completely vs just locked would have incentivized exploration for these skills further if they wanted to pat out game time.  Either way I did like that we could see everything in the skill tree regardless as it makes the game a bit more casual so I can enjoy the story which is fantastic.  Most areas had decent mapping with 2 in particular that seemed over complicated to heighten backtracking and difficulty.  Overall the story anime-esque and very much a little heart tugger that it kept me watching cutscenes and story events even with the shoddy american dub it was cohesive and wasn't too outlandish for me to break my immersion.Story 40/50As with most souls games you want to know combat.  Is it exactly the same???  Well kinda?! Movement is very dark souls in the respect of high weight less roll low weight more roll ect ect.  Parries linked to what armor you decide to use as some will parry faster while others will do more damage or drain more ichor/mana (great change).  Weapons arn't too complicated but basically broken up like DS, but simplified. Two handers > one handers > gun handers.  This allows for 3 core playstyles with some combo variation in between and some oddball ones thrown in to add variety.  This is further reinforced with the 3 skills received at the beginning of the game.  Basically think Warrior-Assassin-Mage and you get the ghist of how which weapons combo with which classes better.  You can always mix and match some skills and enhance a weakness in the class to better suit your needs.  As for the PVE most enemies can easily be transposed some will do them slower others will do them quicker.  Some will have aoe effects and buff.  Most enemies are very solid some punish you very hard for using a certain playstyle in some areas. To fight against though some later in particular feel like they combo you as much if not more then some bosses while maintaining high hp for a minion. If you want a bit more challenge play without AI partner as the game was designed with the partner always with you.  Overall combat is easy to understand flows fairly well but does seem to have issues with I-frames, backstab hit boxes are iffy imo, and your partner sometimes does all the work or none at all lol.  It could be that I don't use my items enough also....Mechanics 40/50Multiplayer is fun although I kinda wish we could do 3's or 4's just to have that anime squad while removing the AI if more then 1 player joins.  I feel like the multiplayer could have been done a bit different to make it a bit more casual friendly while also separating it from DS.  By these I mean if you are doing a private game (with password) the teammate can rest at mistles/bonfires with you once per mistle, still cannot tp out or tp to a different mistle in the same area but this would keep co-op from being a connect almost dead reconnect fest if you are trying to recoup from a mistake lol. just an idea.   Anyways co-op is fun no real lag issues other then general game lagginess in random parts.  Quick connection.  Jolly cooperation.  Individual loot.Co-op 45/50Ok so lets get to my worst bits.  The maps are a little bit of a mixed bag.  I get what they're going for but to keep things spoil free I think some maps are way to complicated while others are very simple.  Although I think good mapping in games is hard I will give it an average score because it doesn't break the game.  There are 2 maps in particular that I did not agree with which are both late maps.  One was very dark soulsy and was a bit complicated to navigate since you are required to navigate its complexity to progress.  Though it wasn't difficult it was just ill fitting for the rest of the maps.  Felt like it was designed first and with jump in mind.The other one felt like it needed to increase the difficulty for the sake of it.  I got one shotted by the map and not the enemy and I don't mean falling off something.  This was because the enemy units and the ""map gimmick"" where annoying   fire if you know what I mean.  Thankfully I think the devs knew this and the area wasn't too long.  These are just personal gripes you might find these 2 areas great. Other maps were decent nothing too crazy fancy though.  Enemies were appropriate while some feeling a bit too strong for the level+area just to defend a common item. Map+enemies 30/50So all in all this game is pretty fun with a lot of potential for replay especially with the co-op and ng+ options.  Story is a pretty solid point and combat is refined, but not polished.  Progression is entirely up to how you want to play so leaves many options for creativity.  Character creation is great but can use some improvements.  Flow of the game is a mixed bag but overall I was happy to sit on my butt and play this game wasn't a complete broken mess or overly challenging for its target audience.  Solid game all around with room for growth in the next installment or dlc.  Also Anime Plot is pretty noice..... :) Overall gameplay score 4/5 for me.Recommended if your down for Anime plot and anime PLOT and decent gameplay that wont smash your kneecaps to hard.  If your into soft souls and not dark souls, but like the combat but not the difficulty or you just enjoy somewhat challenging games.			"

Recommended,90.1,"																Just finished the game after around 26 hours.Wow what a ride - I really enjoyed it a lot more than I think I would.To be honest I was about to scrap the game after the slow start but everything unfolds so nicely a few hours in.The only really annoying part was the cathedral because it was just so boring and long and I had enough of the design after a few minutes.But I'm glad I kept on playing and was rewarded with the most fun combat I've played in a while.To switch around skills and gear is so painless and smooth that makes it really easy to play the game in so many different ways.I had hours where I just switched around stuff to see how the flow will change and it always did.They also make sure you have enough resources most of the time so I had no issues with the cost - only unlocking stuff permanently from the start is kind of expensive.Maybe I'll find a script to ""fix"" that so I can play around some more.Difficulty wise it was on the easier side as long as you had a companion with you and the game made it really easy to over level.Coop just did not work out for me at all so I tried it only 3 times - all of which were unsuccessful in one way or the other.So if your focus is on that I would wait a little until they might fix some of the issues (disconnects/broken story/crashes).When it comes to coop i just wish all games from now one would work as perfect as it did in Remnant.A thing I really loved was the vestige system as it reminded me of the dreams in lost odyssey (a game which holds a special place in my life because of those sequences).Also give the soundtrack a listen:) It's really good!For me it was worth the money but people just should not expect a carbon copy of souls.Just watch the fextralife review and if you like what you see/hear give it a go.NG+ is implemented in a way you can't start it by accident.

Not Recommended,11.9,"																Finished the game, and here's a quick understanding:- Gameplay is souls-like.- Mobility is somewhat similar to Nioh and Sekiro(Haven't bought nor played them yet, but watched some gameplay).- Game is designed to assume you brought a companion, due to enemy stats not scaling .- Don't expect too much in the story.- Boob jiggles.- Bosses have high HP.- You can level up, but it's more of an attack, health, and stamina increase.- 3 endings- Weapons and Blood Veils(equipments) are few at the start, but becomes plenty as you progress and discover them.- Shop sells you variants of the Blood Veil.- They can be upgraded. Max is 10.- They can be transformed(Elemental attacks, debuffs, status effect, raw damage)- Time your parry and it will automatically counter.- Different animation for each Blood Veil types- Basic sword is a pipe, while basic hammer is a piece of a broken column.

Recommended,165.9,"																(this wont be a professional review by any means top kek)Now i haven't properly played a souls like game ever before (played dark souls remastered at a friends' for a bit and didn't like it) but i can tell you now i am severely addicted to CODE VEIN. The combat feels so nice (imo), the graphics are amazing (Run at mostly maxed settings, but at some scenes the textures are glitched out), the animations are pretty good for the most part (in some cut-scenes the animations look a little weird) and the sound track is a banger. In terms of performance FPS wise i get about 70-50 fps ( I have an i5 2400 with an RX580 so its bottlenecking hard af lmao) so its alright for what i'm getting. I think if i were to nit pick something it'd be the hair physics, although it is present in a lot of games it is still quite annoying (to me at least) to see hair no-clipping through bodies in cut-scenes (in regular game-play the physics are good as far as I've noticed). Basically, if you're a weeb like myself, are looking for a game to play and just so happen to have enough to purchase this game, i highly recommend you do. (I haven't finished the game just yet but am close to doing so)			"
Recommended,21.6,"																CODE VEIN is an interesting hybrid of games, all of which work surprisingly well together. The most prominent aspect of CODE VEIN is its affinity towards the Souls series. CV features many staples of FromSoftware's games, such as the 3rd-person dodge and attack gameplay. Although CV does feature this type of combat, it adds a lot of variety through Blood Veils, Gifts, etc. Another game feature that surprised me (although it shouldn't have) is its gifting system. Much like other anime games, you level up characters' ""Friendship Meter"" (Though in this case it's Trade Points) by giving them little trinkets that you can find or buy. It's not a required thing, but it does help you nack some sweet gear. there's only one thing I find a bit disappointing in CV, which was the lack of variety in the music, i.e. Boss Themes, Area Themes, etc. TL;DRCODE VEIN is a charming, fast-paced Souls game that adds a bit of stylish flair to the mix.			"
Recommended,29.9,"																In my opinon it's good take on dark souls style of combat. Didn't brake what didn't need fixing and build upon it with it's own twist. Great character customization and creation. Very Anime in both visual and story but I like it. Though I know it's not for everyone.If you like dark souls and anime it's most likely for you. If you only like one you could still give a chance. If you hate both, most likely not for you. Still, I love the game.			"
Recommended,73.1,"																I bought this game because I really liked the look and detail of the character creator, the art-style and I thought the gameplay would be passable.I didn't expect the game to have a really heartfelt, sad story, with the option of better things if you try hard enough!StoryIf you're not a fan of bleak settings where things are bad, and are going to stay bad unless you do something spectacular, I'd avoid this game pretty much right away. I don't want to give away too much in the review but the story starts off very slowly and makes a great effort to build the world before it starts talking about what the Protagonist is going to do in it. The NPCs all have interesting backstories that all tie into the main plot of the game, and the fact the game has an actual plot is a huge positive. If you're experienced with the Soulsborne games you'll know they have a very loose 'plot' if you can call it that, and is mostly worldbuilding you pick up and learn about. This isn't the case here, it has a story to tell you and you're involved in it as the player, which is a refreshing change.I'd advise switching to the JPN audio with subtitles if you can stand it at all, as the subpar English dub really hurts a lot of emotional moments.I really like the ups and downs of the story, and it really grabbed me. How much it will for you is entirely subjective, but it has a lot of the typical anime story elements and tragedy. The fact that you can influence the world though and it's not just a complete depressing mess makes me very happy though, speaking of which..Having gotten the True Ending (1 of 3) first time through with no guides, I can safely say if you're paying attention and trying your best, the game won't trip you up with a bizarre puzzle of items you'd have to have collected prior to starting the final boss, a la Sekiro/other Soulsborne games.GameplayThe gameplay resembles Souls games, I'm sure you've heard that over and over again if you're even looking into this game briefly. I will say though, if you're a Soulsborne Veteran, this game won't test you at all. I died probably 20/25 times through the entire game, and most of them were on very cheap Depths bosses. (Depths is optional exploration content, with re-used bosses/enemies for upgrade materials and blood codes)If you die or rest, the enemies respawn, if you die you drop your experience and will have to go get it without dying to get it all back. Bonfires giving you your healing charges back, big areas with shortcuts back to bonfires, etc. Normal Souls template.Few key differences: Return to the main base and go into the Hot Spring to return half of your lost experience without risking yourself if you feel that is safer, the other half is lost forever after this. That's a nice little compromise in my book, and if you don't like it you can completely ignore it.Skills and Builds are changed pretty much on the fly. You spend XP to level up your character, but you don't put the levels into stats like Souls games. Instead, levelling up just increases things like health and stamina, and the build variety is tied into the games 'Blood Code' system. You gather Blood Codes throughout the game, and can switch into another one at any time. Skills inside these Blood Codes can be purchased with XP at bonfires, and then the skills can be mastered either through play, or through consumable items so that it can be used in any other Blood Code.This lets the player create entirely unique builds with abilities and passive buffs that they want, rather than what they feel they 'built into' early on and feel restricted. A lot of the better Blood Codes are hidden away, so go huntingThe ability uses are limited by mana represented by a number (EG: 25/25, ability costs 6), and by a cooldown on them, even if hit out of them. You get mana back by hitting enemies or using items/resting.Weapons and armor have scaling that you're used to from Soulsborne games, but because you can switch builds on the fly and no carry weight (there is equip wgt), you can keep multiple builds ready.World + World ConnectivityThis section is mostly aimed at Soulsborne players. The game's world is pretty much how it is in Dark Souls 3 / Bloodborne. The entire world isn't tied together, but the levels themselves are filled with shortcuts that tie back towards Bonfires (Mistle in-game), so you'll be right at home. Just don't expect anything like Dark Souls 1. On that topic, the game does have a serious problem with a small budget. The levels themselves can range from looking good to looking so bland and boring you'll think you've accidentally started up the latest CoD. Some areas are beautiful, others are rubble corridors. Endless rubble corridors that loop back into themselves. Big warning about the Cathedral level, which is all identical platforms and corridors, and is absolutely MASSIVE.The shortcuts themselves are also very simplistic, they're all one-way doors or ladders. When you add that into a really boring plain level, the game can start to feel very very cheap. Also the boss themes, there's basically ONE theme until you hit the mid-game point boss (Cathedral End), where upon you start to get boss specific music. All of this really does make the game feel cheap and lacking right up until the mid-game, it's clear they had a hard budget and had to make decisions on what to spend it on. I think the overall result is still good, but man this game with a bigger budget would be a sight to behold.NPCs and Side QuestsParty members at base will accumulate throughout the story, and you can choose who to take out with you as a partner for exploration. You can go it alone if you want to as well, but you'll miss out on some story reactions and flavor text. They give warnings about enemies, point out items and shortcuts, and are a big help in combat sometimes. If you reach 0HP with a companion, they can send some of their HP to you to save you before you die. You can do it for them too, but it's cooldown based. It does feel great when it works, like you're fighting right on the brink and giving it everything, with the anime style it can make Vein reach some dizzying heights. Other times, the companion breaks or is stuck in a move when you die and they don't revive you.Side quests pop up in areas, usually after the boss fight of that area. You'll be killing the boss of an area, going back to the Mistle and swapping between all the levels, looking for the NPC indicator on the minimap. I should state here that the party members (Everyone back at Home Base) get cutscenes and other really powerful story moments that are missable, so you'll want to do those. Those are tied into the Vestige and Blood-code systems, and you'll want to get those. Vestiges, simply put, are the pieces of Blood Codes. Collect an amount of them specific to one person (Usually about 4-5), watch cutscenes as you put them back together, get a complete Blood Code at the end.As for the garden variety NPCs and side quests; they do build the world with their dialogue but it's very rudimentary. Most of them will tell you to go get an item or kill an enemy that's literally around the corner from where they are AND is marked on the map, then come back to them. No thought required here. They spit out some expository dialogue at you and a pretty bad item, and then that's your lot. Up to you, but I did most of them in my playthrough.OnlineThere's no PvP at launch, that may break it right away for some people so I thought I'd get that out of the way. They might add it later. Coop can be restricted to passwords and by region, doesnt require an item and is really easy to engage in. Complete the entire level and boss for a reward. It is fun to do with friends, but you'll be doing the same area twice to progress through the game together.			"

"
Recommended,32.2,"																From what I've played, I can't say this game is that bad. It's got flaws. Just like everything else on the planet. It's got cool stuff too. Some of the animations are really sick, and the first time you see them it's a jaw-dropping and makes you wanna do them more.Multiplayer is really nice and quick, unlike any other game of the genre. You matchmake within seconds as long as your friends or whoever are actually sending out a signal. There are plenty of bugs and weird things happening in multiplayer right now, but I'm sure it'll get ironed out.If you've played Remnant: From the Ashes.. this game is so much better and entertaining than that game. Rooms and places feel meaningful to explore, much unlike Remnant's empty shell of a game. Code Vein still suffers from some of the ""samey"" enemy types, but I can at least say for certain that this game is 5x the game Remnant is and ever will be. If you played Remnant recently and ended up hating it like I did due to the lack of fun to be had in the game, try out Code Vein. It's got something for everyone to enjoy, I think. Whether it's just messing with the character editor to create the perfect anime tiddies waifu or something, or co-oping with friends.. it's still a solid experience. I compare this to Remnant specifically because lots of people where looking forward to that game, and in my eyes, was a complete and utter failure that could not achieve even remotely what it set out to do.The biggest problem with this game that is what everyone should universally agree on is how ""safe"" the game is. It doesn't do much new to the genre that it's based on. It brings little to the table, instead just takes what's already on it. However, it's still a very solid experience, 7.5-8/10 from me.All in all, this game is much like how Nioh was to me. I still liked Nioh more cuz idk. Opinions or something. But, it's a very solid experience and don't let what the internet says about it ruin that for you. If you're wary on it due to the pricetag, just wait on it and play it down the line when it's on sale. It's worth the money either way in my opinion however. I just hope the DLC ends up being good, and I'll update the review later on to reflect that.			"
Recommended,66.4,"																if you play this game without a companion and you forget the whole anime dark souls crap you will find a very challenging game with an amazing build variety and loads of content that also looks good and plays smooth on pc (if your pc is up to par obviously.)if you use all the systems and mechanics in the game you will find this game as deepm flexible, and replayable as the best of them. combat really comes out once you use all the combat tricks they give you. i've always appretiated the hard but fair gameplay of dark souls. however the guy that makes those is some type of genuis with it. anyway i think code vein gets the spirit of that but they do fail here and there. there are certain enemy placements, gang ups, and some boss and unit moves that are plain unfair. but it is rare and they mostly got it right.word of advice if you go into this game with the anime dark souls mentality you might not enjoy it. the combat becomes really engaging when you make a build and use abilities and combo draining correctly. and also play without a companion which is not immediatly apparent but can be done from home base.i think it has enough to make it it's own, just like nioh for instance which i enjoyed a lot as a diablo soulslike in a way :) and i think there is a lot of stuff here that doesn't make me think all the time that i rather be replaying dark souls.there has been an explosion recently of souls like games. remnant for instance was cool but did not have nearly enough content. surge 2 is alright, but it has a lot of questionable mechanics and extremely bland and muddy everything. ashen, yea we don't talk about that around these parts. point is i don't think you can do much better on that front.game had a 60 score on metacritic and i didn't even get it for the first day... but now i can't stop playing it and already have like 10 hours in a day and i am starting on right now again. what i am trying to say is i love it :)			"

Recommended,37,"																I can pretty safely say that Bandai hit the nail right on the head with this one, from beginning to end, the writers have my thanks for such an excellent work.+ They made you care about every single character you met, and none of the cutscenes relevant to this felt boring or repetitive.+ Cutscenes were excellent, albeit with their anime twang, were never cringey or overdone.+ Gameplay mechanics were great, excellent use of the code/gift system to make a VERY customisable system of play.+ Emotionally charged and riveting, I was pressed to the screen, cheering for allies and reaching for the tissues through various parts of the game. + Complete. The game felt complete, even though there are DLC coming out in the near future, they didn't force an ending that felt empty or not meaningful. At least for the one I was able to do.+ Hand holding was to a minimal, despite being incredibly helpful and appropriate when it was used.+ Not rail roady at all, exploration was very freeing and had you going back to past areas.+ Cute girls and Cool dudes. Especially Yakumo. - Could be a little confusing at times with the gathering of vestiges and side quests, but that also ties into a + of not being too hand holdy and rail roady.

Many customization options for class and combat style.The problem that I have is with the character creator. I would love to have a smaller character and not an NBA character, sadly there isn't a height slider. The only slider concerning body is a skinny/robust slider.Another problem is ""CO-OP"" which is more like ""save your friend for a couple of minutes"" gameplay. This is NOT Co-op, it's the same system from Dark souls and it makes it annoying. You only get to play a level at a time (progress only saves for host) and if any of you die, that means: Start server again -> Friend has to connect (Load screens BTW) -> Die again? Repeat!It would be really much better if instead of disconnecting on death, it would just send both players to the last save point.Also I would love to have mod support even if it was offline only.7/10			"

Recommended,97,"																Having played this game for about 40 hours now, and as an avid GodEater player, I can say I really enjoyed the game. I had been waiting for this game for about 2 years when it was first announced, and was extremely disappointed by the delay, but I feel that the GodEater team really delivered on this game. Clearly taking some environmental mechanics (bonfires and the like) from the souls series, it was an interesting, but welcome change of pace for me. What I found particularly interesting was me and my friend discussing the game as we played.To put it shortly, depending on your route, you will get different blood codes. Spending an hour looking for a blood code I thought I missed, we discovered our choices had branched, and we were now receiving different codes. I in particular received a code with a 'gift' that one-shotted most regular enemies when equipped with the code.I don't mind the tropes myself, but I see some do, so be prepared. Overall, the story is pretty solid and concise, and if you played GodEater, I recommend giving this a try for story reasons.Character creation is phenomenal as pretty much everyone has said. Frame rate stayed consistent for me except when loading in large areas, but quickly subsided. Overall, I definitely recommend this game and hope that this will be the first of line of Code Vein games.Oh, and I got the 'Heirs' ending. Supposedly the least gotten one from what I've seen.			"
Recommended,53.4,"																The game is worth it for the character creation alone, the amount of customization is insane, and you can really personalize your revenant.In short many would prob, call this Anime(-styled) Dark Souls. Still there are so many features in the combat system etc. that doesen't leave it as a dull copy, but rather a game on it's own two feet. An example of this would be the Blood Code system, wich allows you to play however you want, and mix elements from other playstyles.This game is all the things i enjoy. DO RECCOMEND IT!			"
Recommended,30.8,"																Great game lots of customizations, unique weapons, cool armors, lots of lore and code classes to acquire. So many different builds and powers its insane. The story starts strong but falls apart in the end, personal opinion didnt like the ending. It needs more villains rather than just two. If you like God Eater meet Dark Souls with Freedom Wars mechanics and looks then this game for u.			"
Recommended,33.6,"																I beat the game in about 22-23 ish hours overall I would give this game a 7/10. Don't care too much about the story so I didnt come to this game with high expectations story is ok, nothing to write home about. Combat is ok a bit slower to my liking, last ""souls"" like game I played was sekiro, compared this to sekiro it seems a bit slower imo. Difficulty is really easy I suggest you dont bring a companion if you want a bit of challenge. For my first playthrough I had an AI companion for the sake of having it made the game easier (they can take agro from bosses so you can safely heal, help with a gank etc.) I never really died twice in a row in my playthrough that made me lose haze so I ended up being overleveled (i think) by the time I have to fight the final boss I was level 130 without grinding.			"
Recommended,17.8,"																The critics who reviewed this game before release were all 100% smoking crack. It's the same old ""erg soulslike 2 hard so I give game bad review."" Don't listen to them at all until you've played this game for yourself. This game is amazing. Being an avid soulslike AND anime fan, this game is a dream come true for me. The combat, graphics, story, and characters are all immersive and engaging to me and I don't regret my pre-purchase one bit.Pros:- Beautiful Graphics- Amazing japanese VAs- Great character customization- Lovable characters- Companions are actually helpful and smart- Awesome combat- Fun bosses- Louis- Decent amount of playtime, game is longCons: - Slight frame drops in some areas (probs my GPU)- English VAs are good but not as good as the japanese VAs- The enemy design is okay but not as much variety as the souls gamesThat's the short version, but all in all this game is great and I'll be replaying it to get every ending.

Recommended,19.6,"																So first off, awesome game. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really enjoying it.Great character creator, lots of options, more than most other games that allow custom characters. The combat is pretty good too. Like it was said in another review, it's a great mix of dark souls and god eater combat. You can also come up with some really interesting builds and have a companion that works well with it. The story so far is also great. I feel it starts out a little slow/simple, but then it really picks up after the 2nd or 3rd boss.I recommend it			"
Recommended,63.5,"																I waited a long time for this, and it lived up to most expectations, failed some, and far exceeded some.If you played any Dark Souls-style game, you know the basics of how the gameplay works, explore, wack a boss, watch cutscene, dodge a lot while going the aforementioned things. Just wished it was designed as a solo experience and not a NPC co-op game.While the companions got a few lines they like to repeat they also have a good number of things to occasionally say about the current story or locale, and talking about all the things you'd been through together while exploring the last map.I personally dont know how magic systems work in the later Souls games but the ""Ichor"" system here is quite close to the Oracle Cell system in God eater, you can use it like ""ammo"" or ""mana"", but you have to go into melee combat to restore it so a pure-range build is hard to sustain. Excluding the gameplay loop, it shares the most similarities with God Eater, everything from the art style to the world setting and backstory and even the glowy spikes poking out from the earth everythere (but they're more spikey here than god eater i think), if you have seen the anime or played either of the first 2 God Eater games its very easy to understand things since as i said, lots of similarities, ""Great Collapse"" a few years ago, you got a unique ability no one else has (See glimpses of others memories in this case) which makes you invaluable to the team, a single voiced line at the final encounter, a weapon/coat that rapidly transform to drain cells/blood from enemies, a constant struggle of control against the implanted cells/bracelet thing or Bloodthirst and enemies that disperse into glowing particles and comes back and your trapped in a city surrounded by ""gods"" (monsters) everyone is afraid of or a Red Mist that everyone is afraid of. So if yo u like the setting or science in God Eater this is the same thing but with some vampire themes. There is a unmissable moment where they acknowledges the similarities and as a fan of both this game and god eater i hope its something they'll delve deeper into with the season pass or future sequels in either franchise. (Or maybe im just spoiled with Final Fantasy and Monster Hunter doing so many small tie-ins with other games in recent years xD).So gameplay is Anime Dark Souls, World and Setting is Vampire God Eater but the overall feeling is closer to Final Fantasy Type-0 (The darkest Final Fantasy to date) especially from the view point that each time people in Code Vein dies and comes back they leave some memories behind and end up forgetting important things or people at times, which reminded me a lot of Type-0 where if anyone dies, everyone instantly forgets about them.Some say the combat its a bit clunky but i think that's much attributed to ones ""movement type"" since being slow feels very restricted in hectic situations while quick feels much better but normal should probably have been a little more responsive, its all decided by equipment if you take the big or small weapon with you (only the current weapon+coat counts, you have 2 weapons on you so you can have one quick-movement back-up weapon if you want to change mid-combat).Difficulty:By default, the companions are quite capable fighters which takes away much of the challenge from you so while harder than your average game, its probably the easiest Souls-like game. (People that complain everything is too hard, rejoice you can be carried in single-player now!) THAT said, if you leave the companions in home base and venture out alone things gets A LOT harder, especially some of the later bosses where the margin for error is very small and without the NPCs around to save your bacon its quite a different story.So to me the best and worst parts to me:	 Best: -The unmissable God Eater-thing-Rin (home-bases weapon vendor) Memory scenes.-The customization, both appearance and play-style. since stats is tied to Blood codes so you can change mid-playthrough if you want to focus more on ""magic"" (gifts) instead of big 2 handed weapons, just change the blood code and equip the appropriate gear. (this is another similarity to God Eater where you can pretty much do the same thing by changing weapon components).-The ""map"", until you find the things that reveal the map its completely dark, but it shows footprints of where you've been so you got like a skeleton map of what you've seen so far, possibly with A LOT of footprints in boss rooms xD the foot print trail is quite long and can span multiple maps if you don't do much running back and forth in them.Worst:-Designed to be played with the AI companions, while you can go alone, its very clear it was not designed for that.-Absence of music, like it got some good tracks here and there (mostly in story moments), but feels like most of the time, especially during exploration it just blends into the background TOO much and fades away, and one battle theme in the ""cathedral"" map random encounters didn't always blend back into the exploration music very well and i probably noticed it every time.-The invasions where you just get swarmed by enemies (they teleport after if you try to run away to other parts of the map) and no real reward for surviving.-Multiplayer seams lacking looks like its only a come-help or go-help system for a single map at a time and not a dedicated game mode for playing together, but i don't have anyone to play with anyway :p-Combat uses a stamina system for the player. sure its standard for souls games and God Eater also has it so it was probably inevitable for this game... but i still hate stamina based combat >_< just making a note of it for people that like or also dislike that feature.Non-combat tip: Talk to the 2 home-base vendors now and then to see if you can get their blood codes, you get one early on and the other quite a while later but both of them got a good quality-of-life gifts that can be unlocked for use with any blood code, one lets you teleport to the last checkpoint and keep you haze (souls) and the other speeds up the time it takes to unlock gifts for use with any blood code. Terminology:""Gifts"" are basically every passive bonus, attack skill or spell. ""Blood code""s are like ""classes"" that decide your stats and all have varying numbers of gifts mostly matching the intended play-style of the code, ~98% of them can be unlocked for use with any code that meets the stat requirements to use them. (So like God Eaters Blood Arts and later Burst Arts you'll probably spend a lot of time unlocking a lot of them).TLDR:God Eater but its anime vampire Dark Souls, Go with companion for intended experience, easier than average souls-like then, or go alone for hard-mode. If that sounds good, then give it a try.If just part of it sounds good.... wait for a sale and then give it a try? :D			"
Recommended,47,"																It's good but I'd wait for a sale. I was definitely let down by the combat coming into it after the Surge 2, though Deck 13 has had a few botched attempts at souls-likes. I think if they make a sequel after learning from this one, the series could really come into its own (and I hope it does). If you're a fan of the genre you're probably going to get this either way, just don't expect anything too difficult or deep.			"

Recommended,89.1,"																For now, as I'm still very early into the game, I'll just show my support for this game, I love it!Very expansive character creator, and atmospheric environments, not sure why people bash on them. Sure they aren't as intricate designed as what you would expect from Dark Souls, but that honestly is not a comparison that people should keep on making. Code Vein is it's own unique product. Combat feels fast and snappy, bosses are fairly difficult and their attacks are quite quick, so they're not too easily readable. Also, so far a nicely narrated story to back all of this up.Code Vein is definitely easier than other ""souls-likes"" out there, but that contributes to having an AI partner with you. Playing alone this game is about as hard as any other similar game out there.Will update once I'm done with the game.			"
Recommended,23.3,"																Do you like Soulsbourne-style games?Do you like anime?If your answer is yes to either questions, I'd absolutely recommend this game to you.PROS- Great character creator- Satisfying combat- Beautiful graphicsCONS- Some minor clipping issues- Some areas are a bit repetitive- You'll become a weebOTHER THOUGHTS- Backstab locations on some enemies are hard to negotiate, often resulting in a blade/hammer to the mouth (probably intentional tbh)- Character creation can take hours because it all looks so damn good- English voice acting is OKAY, play in Japanese for the best experience- When moving throughout the world, a dotted trail is left on the map to show you where you've been. Fantastic and underrated featureOverall, I'd rate 8/10. Rating is subject to change, as I am nowhere near done the game.			"
Not Recommended,4.3,"																I have played this game for fair bit of time to understand the feel and overall aesthetic which I find highly enjoyable.Combat is reminiscent of the Dark Souls series but easier and less punishing, in my opinion. The controls may be different but some tweaking can allow you to remap the old controls. Presentation is well executed, showing off their superbly in-depth character creation which, I'm sure, this game was hailed upon. The anime-esk atmosphere is quite the interesting take for a souls game. Music is something I believe that they nailed. The intro theme is a great way to present what this game is about. A dark yet hope-filled story. The scores that accompany the bosses are well done but I can't say it was superbly memorable. Darksouls 3 I felt made a true lasting impact with their music and made it memorable, excluding a small select few. That being said, this is my first play through, so maybe my second will solidify it.The story, thus far, seems to follow a ""classic"" story of ""world has turned to hell, bad guy is harming survivors, kill said bad guy and obtain the McGuffin. I may totally wrong since my playtime, and story progression, doesn't justify my crétiques as I have yet to advance in the story, however something I learned by one of my Video Game Design classes is that the game should present what is has to tell to the player but do it in a way that isn't straightforward so that some can be shrouded in mystery, intriguing the player to find more. Is the story enjoyable? I'd say so. Just like my first play through with Darksouls 3 I didn't fully understand or appreciate the story because I was too focused on other corners of this game. I would hope that this game offers a New Game+ so that instead of looking in every nook and cranny (I like taking all items within an area before advancing on my first play through.Something I found glaring was the lack of facial animation when entering, what I call, a ""small cut scene"". These occur when people talk to you when interact with them or, most noticeably, when you finish a Vestige and a character remarks on the memory. Perhaps it would be time consuming, believe me when I say it is without motion capture, but I felt even mundane mouth movements, such as animating a mouth saying ""watermelon"" which is a neat trick, would have been better than a stagnant face. While not nearly as compelling Darksouls or Darksouls 3 it is hard to top what is essentially a masterpiece and then have an entire new coat of anime-paint brushed on. Still, the story is good enough to lure most players into the world's mysteries.All in all I am impressed with this game despite what Critiques say. I pray they don't bring the dull ""this game is too hard"" remark as they did with the Darksouls franchise just because someone couldn't master it in less than an hour, that hour does't include the create-a-character area. This game presents a new take on the souls game genre and I believe they did a great job at it and put their heart into it. While some areas may seem repetitive or animations seem a bit uninterested, excusing it's better features would be farcical. This is a great RPG, Adventurer game with the souls genre stapled to its core. Anime lovers and a majority of the Darksouls community may find themselves creating their own memories in this game and, hopefully, retain them to remember a game that is grand.			"
Recommended,97.1,"																I think now i have enough time to give a honest review ,in my opinion this game is wonderfull and surely i will invest more time into it.(I think some sploilers are ahead read it with a warning in your mind)When you want to play Dark Souls go somewehre alse and please do not bother anyone wiht your negative review , but if you have realised that there can't be a equal to Dark Souls because its a game for it self and taken it as a Souls-Like game and look at it from a cleen perspective (as also a game for it self) you will have your portion of joy.First you need to realise the step above after you did that we can continue with the second one. Done ? Good.Lets continue ,the game does a lot of fun from the time where you create you Character(with a good amount of customization) to the point were you meet your Wife (ye i will just call her that) and after the first min the game will continue to give you a good story , good fights, good plot(both kind of plot)(and the plot is good on both sides after all its an ""Anime-Like"" game and if you do not like that kind of stuff , you should inform you befor you buy it. Which you did with my review i am proud of you).Now to some Tech information, you do not need to have a Gaming pc I my self have a Normal/Good one and i run everything one Max Spec , even with a not so high end Gaming Pc you can run on Normal Spec and it looks beautiful (This is not Crysis afterall). I my self had no Problem with the game , no crashes and it runes fluently ( What you shouldn't forget with diffrence Pc parts you need diffrente adjustmants, but as a fallow Gamer i expect that you know this and don't start to go on a hate traine after something didn't work how you want it).I would give the game a Solid Vampire/Blood wish you the same amount of fun i have with it.A very great story Nominated it for 2019 Story Award.

Recommended,20.2,"																As a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne when i heard about this game in 2018 with a trailer a mate showed me at study. i was like ""A dark souls style anime game could be really cool"" and what you know it's a pretty awesome game.I have finish this game and got the good ending now so i have my score so far in the gamecharacter creation: 10/10 The character creation screen is awesome and i love. There is so many options to making your character, giving players a variety of ways to make there character.Story: 8/10 Look when it comes to the story of Code Vein, It has it's up and downs like it really depends on some people if they enjoy the story or not. But i did feel connected with most of the character in the game, learning there past and about who they're.  Plus since there is more then one ending to the game, i feel like i need to replay the game again to see those ending.Graphics: 8/10 Runs fine besides Some Stuttering/Frame Drop Issues in solo. But in Co-Op OMG let me tell you, Me and my mate were tried to play it and i sometimes was crashing when joining him. sometimes my backstab won't work, sometimes my character was disappearing after cutscene, My character sometimes stay locked on a enemy even when it was dead. So there was a few problems with Co-Op but Solo was fineVoice acting: 8/10 Look it's better then SAO Fatel Bullet voice acting. But it annoying when characters repeat the same lines over and over again when exploring the worlds. Like i understand that they're trying to make the characters more alive and chat with your character but when you run back to part you just ran past and they repeat the same line it's very annoying.Combat: 9/10 Fun combat systems hack and slash game what can i say. Like it really similar to Dark Souls with, Weapon/armour scaling, Weapon/armour weight and etcetera so if you play Dark Souls a lot you got use this pretty quick.Bosses: 9/10 Only 2 bosses in this game that really felt challenging but the rest of them were not really that hard and i solo most of the game besides the 2 bosses Blade Bearer/Cannoneer and Skull KingI recommend this game. This game was really fun, even tho there were some problem with my experience of playing the game, I still enjoy it. Great job BANDAI NAMCO			"

Recommended,3.4,"																Do you like Dark Souls?Do you like Anime?Do you have an interest in drinking the blood of your enemies while running around with your favorite anime waifu?Well, then this is the game for you!Code Vein takes the aspects that make Dark Souls fun, and tosses it into a JRPG environment with a fully voiced storyline.The NPCs are constantly dishing out lore while you walk and explore the world. No NPC has the same lines, and even comment on things that happen differently.The game ditches Dark Souls' covenant system to use a more class based system.Each class has it's own skills you can upgrade, or unlock.Not all classes have tons of skills, but some do have a list you can unlock for a variety of skills to use.When you ""Master"" a skill, by using it enough times, you can take that skill over to a different Class you choose to be as long as that class has the stats for the skill.There are a variety of weapons to use, and different weapon stats. There's weapon upgrading, and enchanting.There are different armor sets in the game as well that can also be upgraded or enchanted.The story is unique in it's own way, but also heavily JRPG driven.So, if you're not a fan of JRPG's you may not enjoy the story as much.The game runs very smoothly. I'm using a 1080 Ti, but I do get a solid 144fps at max settings without any major dips in the quality or fps.I personally use a controller since it feels the same as Dark Souls, but the mouse and keyboard option is very well made as well.I say this game is definitely worth it, and I can't wait to see what the rest of the game offers me, and the future DLC!This review is made with only 7.4hrs in to the game, but I can taken out 4-5 Bosses already.NG+ will be a blast :)			"

Recommended,26.6,"																Having already invested some time into this game, I can say it's solid for what it offersFor the Souls Veterans, I will say right now: the experience you gained from past games of this genre will help you move around with ease. Especially when you factor in the availability of veils, equipment and codes at the start for different styles of gameplay. That does not mean it holds your hand. In some encounters or paths, using your head and eyes proves useful (something many Dark Souls players will remember from certain moments, like the Sens Fortress area). But it is not as demandingHowever, for the inexperienced, this is a good stepping stone into the genre and from a bit of Coop gameplay and solo gameplay I have done I can say rushing will be your downfall (with notable exceptions to players familiar with this genre, I'm referring to you: speedrunners)Boss battles seem interesting and challenging, and removal of the AI.I partner is guaranteed to make things a tad harder overallOn the subject of the partner: this may not be true, but I feel as if the partner is actually developing alongside you. As an example, I tried using the Bayonet for range combat to see how it works. In the first bits I haven't seen much from the partner's actions but after I took a few ranged hits myself while firing, the partner has since then took of defensive position in front of me (blocking the hits in my stead) while I tried to shoot down targets or luring them closer. Whether or not this means the Ai Partner is smart enough to make judgment calls in combat or is just well scripted remains to be verified. Melee is also viable with a decent pacing and fluidity to it.What follows is an informative review for newcomers to the genreThe game makes use of a Stamina bar which governs your sprint, block, dodge, attacks and anything else that can affect combat and thus careful users and fighters will benefit from managing itCoop is as expected in a Souls  genre: summoning is the key feature with a limit of only one player that can join you. The session ends when the host or the boss is killed and the guest player will not gain any progression. And no, you cannot summon others when the area boss is defeated.HOWEVER, the guest CAN pick up items enemies have dropped and Haze will not be lost to the guest should the host die. In other words: where you don't gain in game/area progression, you gain loot and exp for yourself. Nullifying most of the risk of losing Haze AND providing an incentive for coop playIn addition: There's a region known as the Depths where even if the area boss is defeated, you can still summon people to come and join you.Now: what is ""Haze""? ""Haze"" is this games equivalent to ""Souls"": gain Haze and you gain currency and EXP points to level up and acquire gifts (abilities) to become stronger and better. Haze, like Souls, is gained by defeating enemies and yes, stronger enemies means more Haze. This can also be acquired by selling unwanted items or gear to vendorsAnd to finish it off: Denuvo is indeed in the game, but there have been no game related issues or noticeable PC issues (So... no guys: Denuvo is not damaging this. You're drowning in your own river of tears now)And on the topic of the Server quality, I have not experienced issues yet: seems highly functionalOverall: I recommend this game			"

Recommended,31.7,"																It knows what it wants to be. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before. I wouldn't call it mediocre either, but also not great. It is simply a solid and good game. I have fun with it and for the first few hours at least it remains a constantly enjoyable experience. At times (in the gameplay department) it feels as if the developers wanted to play it a bit too safe and didn't want to take too many risks. This entire game feels more like a good-willed first attempt than something that was built with full confidence. But all in all, yeah, it's a good game. The atmosphere is really nice and the environment along with the ambience gets you in the right mood.All in all, I'd give it 7/10. As a veteran of DS3 and someone who got through DS1 decently I can say that it was worth my time and gave me a fun experience with many small things that I like, such as the setting, the atmosphere, and the characters. (Yeah, they're cliches, but cliches done well.) Oh, and the character creator is awesome! Best generator I have ever seen in an anime game.If there's a second game in the future, then I'll get that too. It met my expectations but also did not exceed them.			"
Recommended,4.9,"																I entered this game with the idea that it was just gonna be anime dark souls. Fortunately, this leans more toward anime than dark souls in nature. Yes, the world is effed up. Yes, you have to hug a bosses ass sometimes to avoid their attacks. And yes, you have i-frames when you dodge roll. There's bunches more similarities like dying and leaving your points in a spot and having to retrieve them or lose them by dying again. There's also parrying and backstabbing and plunging attacks. In spite of all the similarities, I am happier with the differences. There's an actual storyline to follow. Granted, this feels like a callback to White Knight Chronicles where the silent custom protagonist takes a back seat while helping the real main characters of the story complete their objectives. I don't mind as much though due to the combat. It has the classic press RT for more abilities aspect which is cool. The abilities make you feel awesome. They cost points called Ichor, which I didn't realize you regenerated by simply attacking with your weapon. It's one of those combat systems that you don't have to learn to survive, but should learn if you want to thrive. Overall, I like this game, and I recommend it to any souls fan with a weakness for anime!			"
Recommended,72.5,"																Reviews were spot on, very souls like with a new formula to add a learning curve. Character creation is nuts. Class system is very unique and makes character design fun and challenging. Story is uh, garbage  but thats the souls way isnt it? The enemies are a little ugly and bland design wise but they are still varied and challenging. 7/10, if you've been dying for it go ahead and grab it as im having a blast, if youre on the fence wait for a sale as 60 bucks may be a bit high if youre not already sold.

Recommended,7,"																I like anime, love hack/slash, enjoy open class systems.CODE VEIN :+ The usual edge I've seen growing up watching anime.+ ASSETS (looking at you Io)+ A simplistic combat system with a decent learning curve.+ A class system which allows skills to be used by other classes.+ A vast character customization. (Able to change midway.)- I'd recommend playing with a controller. (Unless you're dexterous with your hands.)- Compared to Dark Souls, this felt like it's easier (may just be me.) and the bosses patterns were more readable.I may haven't played for long, but the game has piqued my interest and I plan to play it all. It also hit most of the characteristics that most games have that made me play for days on end! Though yes there's 5 weapons you can choose from, the abilities can sate your needs to fit any playstyle, you just need to find them.Update:Newgame+ ramps the difficulty, I take back the whole ""It's easier the darksoul's..."" once I entered Newgame+ I was ripped a new one, but I ain't complaining.

Recommended,0.9,"																tl;dr:  so far 10/10 turning into an angsty teen again, but still worthI've played up until the first 'real' boss (the first boss you encounter is more of a tutorial/intro, you can literally let your partner kill it mostly). I'll update this in a few days once i complete the game.pros:-Super edgy, you can literally play a my chemical romance ripoff band on a boombox at the home base-Armor has enough spikes to pierce my stone-hard heart-Everyone is a husbando or waifu-Everyone is also a vampire-lots of blood to remind you of the pain you feel inside-customization is very, very good. I made a character named Bob Bowman. I took the hair ribbons, moved them to his face, and covered his eyes with them. Then i covered his head with more ribbons, all max sized. I also made a character named ""Mr. Hatman"". For this character, I took the super edgy cowboy hat, made it maximum size, and stick them all over his arms/legs. He's basically a walking pile of hats.I also made a serious looking beret-wearing gun user. Then I gave her beret a little hat.-The first 'real' boss was actually somewhat difficult until I realized what it was doing. You can probably just farm up to be overleveled for boss fights though.-branching paths. After the first boss, the story takes you to the next zone. But I also found ANOTHER zone in the prior zone. So i'm assuming that means there is optional zones.cons:-Your character's face never really changes. ""You are the chosen one, anakin"". ""-_-"" says your character. Your husbando sits stylishly on the bar stool, ready to down a cold one=> ""-_-"".-If you play with an NPC partner, they never shut up. I got the achievement for 'listen to your partner talk 50 times' before I finished the tutorial dungeon. There might be an option to turn this off, but I was too busy kicking ass and sucking blood to check.-This game might make you listen to bullet for my valentine and dye your hair black.			"

Recommended,40.5,"																TL;DR: I've had the pleasure of playing 8 hours of Code Vein. I can highly recommend this game if you're itching for a ""Bloodborne"" game that isn't The Surge, or Remnant.---Code Vein is yet another Souls game after 3 days since The Surge 2, and a month (and some days) since Remnant. How does this game stack up?- If you have come for a ""successor"" to Dark Souls / Bloodborne, you're going to be disappointed.However, if you're into Anime / Weeb then you should feel at home here. Highly customizable character creation will make you able to customize to your liking for hours, or even days. You can truly be creative, and make monstrosities, and I wont be surprised we're going to see articles, or even a few memes sprouted from this. It isn't as deep as SoulCalibur, but its a close contender.Once you start the exploration part and combat, you will immediately notice you have a companion with you. This is ""forced"" in the first part of the game up to the 1st boss, and companions makes the game hilariously easy from what you're used to in a Souls game. This is optional, thankfully. Playing solo can be brutal.There are many ""Blood Codes"" (Classes) to acquire, and ""Gifts"" (abilities) to unlock, and these Gifts can be ""mastered"" so other Blood Codes can use 'em via Quick Slots. This results in a pretty great customizable experience tailored to your combat style.This game has an actual story with actual cutscenes, unlike Souls games that has hidden lore. Animation is also even done by Ufotable, same studio responsible for Demon Slayer, so there must be voice acting, yes? I'm currently playing with ENG voice acting, but you have JP voice acting for true weebness if you prefer that. Characters are your typical run of the mill types that isn't memorable.You may also have noticed this game supports coop, and well... This isn't exactly ""True coop"" - It's similar to DS3. You send a ""Distress Signal"" and if you have paired up with the same password, you can group up. However once your partner dies, or you die, you all get send back to your world. You also cannot interact with the Mistle (Equivalent to the Bonfire) nor open Chests. This largely only serves as a ""Help Me"" - Stuck with a section? Get help. Stuck with a boss? Get help ... and I am a little disappointed with this, its not a big deal overall, but disappointed.This game is also an accessible ""Souls"" game - If you've been on the fence of trying a Souls title, but despair at the thought of the brutality of the games, then this game is a good entry. Companions are hilariously powerful. Where I was stuck for almost 2 hours, I breezed through in minutes... That's a difference of difficulty...Oh, did I mention there's NG+? I also read there's supposedly a higher diffculty, but after 8 hours, there is only so much I can cover. Will update later.This title doesn't revolutionize the ""Souls genre"" - But it isn't bad either. - 8.1/10			"

Recommended,2.9,"																Except for a few areas, mostly with certain elemental effects or hazards (Sand that drains your Ichor (essentially magic points) or an area in the game that has wall spikes that are harder to dodge than the hardest and fastest bosses in the game) or perhaps an area that took me almost hours to navigate through even with a map that had all the paths shown to me I think this is the most fun I've had with a souls-like.There is a ton of different ""classes"" (Blood Codes) which you can change to at all timesThere is a bunch of weapon types, each with a fair amount of weaponsCombat is ""usual"" Souls-like combat but maybe with a bit more speed and some extra moves related to the ""blood veil"" you wear, which is also responsible for what *type* of special attacks you do.Light attack/Heavy attack/Thrust/Special Charge/Parry/Block/Dodge with the addition of  4x2 slot ""ability"" squares in which you can put ""gifts"".Each Blood Code has their own gifts, yet they can be transferred over to other Blood Codes if they're ""mastered"" (by having them equipped and killing enemies). Depending on which Blood Code it stems from it could be something like ""Less likely to be staggered and increased defense"" from a Tank-ish Blood Code, which you'd then use some Ichor for to temporarily activate. My favorites would be the gift that, while active, restores 75% of the hp you lose (over time) if you get hit, combined with something like a gift that takes some of my HP and restores Ichor for it, so I can quickly stock up on it to use other abilities, like one that increases my damage by 50% but will make me die after 60 seconds of activation (it gets disabled if you kill a boss or rest at a ""Mistle"" (essentially a bonfire)). Some gifts cannot just be unlocked by spending Haze on them. They might require Vestiges. At the ""Hub"" of the game, the Home Base, you can give the Vestiges to a certain NPC to relive a memory of someone else. Instead of getting some sort of Data Pad or reading a Letter, you walk on a path and see a ""visualisation"" of what happened in form of still areas that you walk past that have characters in them. They're voiced and if you do them in order you'll get a pretty good idea of what has happened, which is something I liked. If the memories are of an NPC that is at your home base, they're going to comment on the memory as well [for story reasons i won't mention].There's also passive gifts in their own inventory square that are just always active. Stuff like ""more strength"" ""more Haze for enemy kills"" (Souls in DS) or similar things.I found the Boss Fights to be pretty awesome despite some of them being way too easy (might be biased here because i accidentally killed the fourth boss before the second and third one so I had enough haze to level up a few times) and regular enemy encounters, unlike in some other games of this type, were actually pretty fun. They didn't feel like a chore and didn't really push the thought of ""Well, this sucks."" when you accidentally triggered an enemy invasion which caused a bunch of them to appear behind you. After defeating bosses and exploring areas, it might be worth teleporting back to them and checking your map to see if any new quest markers appeared. NPCs will appear in areas you've visited before (but if you teleport into the general area, you will instantly know that this is the case, unlike in dark souls..) and they will ask you to either fight a strong enemy that's ahead so that they can go on with their journey, or ask you to find something to conduct research with. As a reward they usually give you some haze items, or perhaps a special ""Map"" (to the Depths) where you can get some loot.(Almost) every Area feels unique and has its own setting and atmosphere. I've found myself taking an unusual amount of screenshots because a lot of the places I was in just seemed really cool, or had a great view.I liked the story of the game and it made me finish the game in just a few days (rather than the usual week or two for a game of this length) because I wanted to know what would happen. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I still enjoyed it.My first *proper* Playthrough of this game took 19 Hours and 45 minutes and I recommend it.			"

Recommended,115.7,"																I played through the entirety of this crappy wannabe anime dark souls so you don't have to. This game is not worth your money. Let's go through point by point on why.Spoilers ahead if you care about that.By the way I'm going to get angrier as I write this, realizing that I spend money on this game and played the whole thing.Visuals/character design:The visuals of this game are pretty good. No visual bugs in sight aside from the occasional clipping but that's to be expected. The anime aesthetic is pretty appealing as well, but that may be personal taste. I usually prefer a more consistent and stylized graphical approach to visuals than gritty realism. The character design and character creation are really consistent as well. I'm not the biggest fan of how most of the characters look but they fit well into the world they created. Speaking of the world they created, most of the environments are actually really well done and pretty gorgeous. The character creator is really versatile as well. Most of the characters in the game you could probably remake to a T in the character creator. If you like creating characters, this game has a pretty decent character creator.And that ends the positive things I have to say about this game.Story:The story skeleton for Code Vein is admittedly pretty interesting. Unfortunately, the way it tells its story is so convoluted and overdramatic that it's hard to understand what is happening most of the time. You have the ability to find items that let you travel into the memories of the characters which is most where you get the plot and these segments are incredibly slow and boring. The game then proceeds to use these to force constant backstory for the characters down your throat. Then there's the villain. Or is it villains? Your first real villain are the ""successors"" that were imbued with powers from the Magical Zombie queen after she was killed. Then it's this generic evil scientist guy who you very quickly learn about through entering the memories of the successors. Then it's the evil zombie queen resurrected again. Honestly, I really liked the first one and then the third. It's a decent story just told very, very poorly through the slow and boring exposition memories. The scientist villain guy is only relevant in the story for like...three areas and then is swiftly taken out.(Writing this right as I finished everything else. At the beginning of the game you get to pick a name and a codename for your character. I get the name but the codename doesn't come up even once, at least nowhere I saw. Just weird and unnecessary. Just a weird choice)Characters:There are so many characters in this game that are all very cool and have unique personalities and backstories and interesting powers and abilities and relationships and yada yada yada.There are way too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters in this game, and they constantly try to shove some kind of emotionally manipulative backstory into the plot the entire time. The worst part is, the only character I actually liked from the beginning ends up going crazy and becoming the first boss and you're introduced to this other guy who introduces you to the other cast of characters. As you play through you're introduced to more characters and have to learn their backstories too, each one more tragic than the last. One's family died, another was experimented on, it's all very sad. But guess what, because they're undead they all slowly lose their memories every time they die anyway, so regaining them has no emotional impact whatsoever since after each realization they are effectively a brand new character with a different backstory than the one you already knew, if you even cared about them to begin with.Oh I didn't mention how many named characters there are in this game? There's 18 or more, all with their own sad unique backstories. Try to see them all!Difficulty:I'll be honest in this category. I think I'm pretty decent at games in general, so my commentary on this might be a little biased.That being said, the difficulty in this game is wildly inconsistent. There are some areas in the game that have some decent challenge, but for the most part it's a breeze. I found myself getting through most of the areas without much of an issue. Having an AI companion with you that will heal you when you get downed reduces much of the difficulty down to basically nothing. Even most of the bosses you can beat in one or two tries.That being said, when the game is hard it is unbearably, unfairly hard. There will be an enemy in the area that just has something like 10x the health and 2x the damage as the others in the area. There will be times where the game ""invades"" you like dark souls, but instead of one enemy that can do what you can it swarms you with enemies until you beat them all. That's not even including the more difficult bosses. The damage that the bosses do, all of them, is insane, and many of them have attacks with little to no warning and/or have AOE attacks that can hit from halfway across the arena.Gameplay:It's Dark Souls, but clunkier. What more is there to say?Okay, okay, that isn't fair, there are some design choices I actually enjoy. The Blood Codes are a really cool mechanic for setting up a bunch of different classes and builds that you can swap on the fly. The weapon types are decent as well, and some special weapons have unique abilities. Blood veils (armor) can get pretty confusing, especially since it is literally explained at the beginning as ""Blood veils are confusing but once you learn them they're powerful"" with no other explanation, but the different types are pretty useful.The most frustrating thing in the game however is the Ichor. You have a bunch of skills you can activate and those cost Ichor. You get ichor by hitting enemies. Not a terrible mechanic on it's own. However each class has a max that it can have off the bat and you can increase that maximum by ~20 by landing backstabs and drain attacks. This maximum resets ANY TIME YOU REST AT A MISTLE (bonfire). Not just when you die. This is especially frustrating because backstabbing enemies is by far the most effective way of increasing this maximum, and backstabbing enemies is incredibly wonky at best. ""Just stand behind them and press attack"" but behind is sometimes their hip and sometimes their back and sometimes...not at all! Overall the gameplay is just a awkward and clunky version of dark souls.Lastly I'll go over the worst part of this game...The Level design.My god are the areas unnecessarily large and confusing. Most of the areas are just giant mazes that look exactly the same and occasionally have enemies. One area in particular, the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ large and absolutely everything looks exactly the same that most of my gameplay time was probably spent trying to figure out how the ♥♥♥♥ to navigate that god awful pure white maze. I've seen a lot of complaints about that area and the area ""City of Falling Flame"" but honestly the flame city was one of the areas I actually liked the most. It was really visually appealing and didn't slow you down like a lot of the other environments did with snow or sludge or water or sand. There are spots on the ground that do damage to you if you step on them but they can be easily avoided.Overall though, with little exception, the areas are just bland and unforgettable.And that's the review. Please don't buy this game I can't ask you enough not to. If you're really curious about the gameplay or story, just look up a let's play of it or something. Save your $60. I got it on sale for $30 and it was still a waste of my money.			"

Recommended,25.7,"																For a souls, it has so many problems that makes the game kinda hard to enjoy the more you progress, sure the character customisation is very well done, lots of variety in creating your own character and it's easy compared to the one in the main Dark Souls series, however that's where the line of good stuff ends.The gameplay is very slow and commands won't respond most of the times, the aim lock is pretty garbage too, since it often won't target your enemy, and completely face in another direction, hell even Dark Souls 1 is way faster than this, even if I play Demon Souls on a broken PS3 that will make my game run at 20fps, it will still be faster.The Map Design are absolutely GARBAGE!! no matter how many times you replay them, you'll still get lost and confused (I am looking at you church), nothing ever makes sense, the game barely explain you what you have to do, where you have to go, and you will often question your life choices and what kind of messed up substances the map designers took.The Weapons are VERY limited, sadly you won't have a good time picking a weapon, since you won't find many, especially since the treasure boxes in the stages you play are very limited, so you can only pray till you find something good.One thing that personally bothers me is how you cannot equip the blood veils (capes or jackets they wear) of the Story characters, they look really good and it absolutely makes 0 sense since the character customisation is well expanded, but they couldn't give you an option to obtain their blood veil? I am not sure if they forgot, ever though about it or just wanted to lock them on their original owners, either way it's a very poor decision.To 100% this game and get all the achievements is a REAL torture, you will be forced to get 400 Medals, which can only be obtain if you play with someone online, there is a method to make it faster, but you will need to have someone with you who can be really consistent to help you out, otherwise you will never make it.The DLC are absolutely garbage, 0 content, no new weapon types, despite their description says ''New Weapons'' no story related content, just some useless Arena with annoying challenges that won't affect your achievement hunting, 100% Skip DO NOT BUY THE DLC.Code Vein is worth the play for the somewhat decent story, if you have enjoyed God Eater's story, you'll probably like this one too, but besides that, it has nothing innovative, breathtaking or epic to offer.			"
Recommended,66.9,"																I wish there was an option for indifferent. This game is not bad, jut not very special.If you're interested in this game, you probably like Souls-like games. I did not enjoy this game as much as others, such as The Surge and Nioh. It's an OK playthrough, but it's in the lower half of Souls games. Only play if you have exhausted all other games like it but still need your Souls fix. I'll talk about the problems first.The story is too serious. Every cutscene plays heartwrenching music and acts like it's more important than it is. It's also very cryptic like all Souls games, but I don't feel like finding all of the answers. The big one being what really happened to the world and what's the timeline of events.The level designs overall are not too exciting. They are very maze-like and repetitive, especially the Cathedral area. It's easy to get lost and not remember where exactly you have traveled before.Equipment also feels very lackluster. The weapons I think are fine, although it's hard to tell if there's really any difference from one compared to the other. They're all very equal. The big problem is the Blood Veils. There are so many of them, and extra color variants too, but I really couldn't tell you what the difference is in them even after beating the game. I just wear the lighter ones so I can dodge faster.The biggest issue is the combat. It generally follows the Souls-like kind of difficulty where you will die in a few hits, but it does not do combat correctly. Enemy attacks do not have the wind-up animations like better Souls-likes do. This means that many enemies can go from idle animation to damaging you faster than you can react. It's especially bad on some bosses because they have instant attacks that can practically 1-hit KO you with no warning. That's terrible design.The game is still overall easy though even with the bad combat, because you have a companion that is, frankly, better than you, and when you die, they have the power to revive you. They can solo most enemies by themselves without taking damage and dish out a lot of pain. Yakumo is easy mode for bosses, and a later spoiler partner is amazing for dungeon crawling.The game also loves to have you combat multiple strong enemies at the same time. Especially in the Depths, there are encounters with waves of enemies that always have either 2 big enemies or 2 small enemies with 1 big enemy. If you didn't have your partner, I really don't see how you're supposed to be able to handle it. The game is designed too much around the partners.The game is not all bad though. I still played through it and beat it, but I really don't feel like coming back to it to see the other endings. Get it if you're a fan of Souls-games but wish it was an Anime with all the women having giant boobs and the guys have swords longer than their body.			"
Recommended,64.7,"																Code Vein is a promising game that starts out of nowhere and does a few things differently to a typical Souls Game - such as you being able to equip classes to change your various abilities and how you can respond to the world and the threats inside of it. It's a neat it!Just having beaten the game for the first time 25 minutes ago, I am fresh of all the feelings and thoughts that I'd like to put here.First off, the game starts out really fun. The options are many, you are treated to some experimentation, the tutorial is nice, the character creator *gorgeous*. The game is actually balanced around what you are doing right now...initially.However and quite unfortunately, the further you get into the game, the more it devolves into lazy design meant to irritate a player and provide RNG-impossible odds, rather than a challenge.Up until the ""second major boss fight"" the game is quite enjoyable without concern! Shortly before then one enemy is introduced that can and will kill you quite hard - a sign of things to come - based off badly telegraphed intensely fast, powerful attacks.Now, the game, being a Soulslike, definitely wants to pretend it's difficult. The problem is, it nnnnnnormally isn't. Bosses' tells are often too twitchy to make out correctly, but you can bear with it and they aren't *mostly* awful fights. Besides that it's either 1-2 enemies hiding or approaching, and then the ambush of 3-5. Unless it's a Lost Invasion mechanic in which you trip an invisible point where you get invaded by freshly spawned enemies in groups of usually 3 - and up to about 20 maximum - which you have to deal with.  This is fine early on too...however...I'm extremely pissed off with the game devolving into  laziness later. The last 15% of the game is absolute *hell*, marked by the game's attempt at Ornstein & Smough. There are two enemies, one slow and big and one fast and small. Except while Smough needed to *be there* to hit you, the other guy can just magically smack you from half the battlefield away while you are dodging the other, much more agile foe. This can and will happen with alarming frequency. This fight took me a little while and I ended up calling in multiplayer help for it because I wasn't interested in dealing with it normally.Why?Because in addition to those problems, these enemies had *so much health*. You fought 2 bosses at the same time, with each having regular boss health and more. This actually quadrupled the difficulty of the fight. Normally, aggro is shared between you and your ally, but with 2 enemies possibly both gunning for you, expect to be stunned off-screen and then knocked on your ass.For you see, if you are hit in this game, *you will get hit again*. There is no panic dodging after eating a hit, you will stagger around for an inordinately long time while every single other enemy in the area is free to hit you and *RESET THE STAGGER*.I mention this as a big point because like Dark Souls 2, the late game devolves into ♥♥♥♥ ambushes against multiple, *multiple* foes, relying on this type of artificial difficulty entirely too much.By the way, speaking of stagger - the enemies will randomly ignore their stagger threshold and when you think ""Ah yes, I will hit this  guy so he staggers"" - no. He will ignore that, smack your face off and badly wound you, knock you down, or even kill you. This happens at alarming frequencies late into the game. The fights are 2-3 types of unfair, why not have this on there as well? There are large female enemies that take 4 hits to stagger. I have many times delivered 4 hits only to eat a powerful 80% Hp bar counterattack that I should not have been hit by - just as an example.A unique feature of this game is something akin to cross-classing. You pick up classes and earn them from boss fights. Now, a warrior, let's say, has a weapon ATK buff you can activate. Neat, put it on, kill stuff - boom, it gets ""Learned"" or ""Mastered"". When you then go into the mage-style class, you can deploy that same skill , if your stats meet the requirements. This is a neat feature and even as a big warrior boy it was nice to have a tiny needly little projectile attack to lure singular foes to me.The problem here is these skills, ""gifts"" take enemies killed to master. The expensive ones take longer. What the game never tells you is if you grind an area to level, and you outlevel the enemies in the area, that learning speed becomes *glacial*. I have spend 33 hours on this game knowing this fact from the outset and I haven't mastered about six of the classes out of the first-gameplay attainable ones, during which I played deliberately underleveled to prevent slow skill learning. This feels stupid, nobody tells you and in the end it's only there to shaft you over for wanting to play the game intuitively. This *must* be removed for the sequel.A note on dying, if you have an AI companion - and you really honestly should - they have a chance of reviving you if you die. I say CHANCE because even when the skill is not on cooldown and they aren't dodging anything, they will happily watch you die and lose you progress \ haze (This game's Souls). Yakumo is the worst for this it seems, he honestly lets me die 60% of the time. Similarly, if the AI (or helpful co-op player) dies, you can use this skill to give them a bit of your health within about 3 seconds to prevent them properly ""dying"".The story is practically non-existent. It's not offensively bad, it's not good..it's barely there. A lot of it is revealed to you later on, but instead of being an actual like, reveal of importance, the main draw of the story is its relation to something else some people might be familiar with. You get that reveal 85% of the way through and that's...pretty much it, honestly.The graphics are neat artistically, nothing to write home about on the technology. There is a *lot* of clipping in character models and cutscenes, but that's just something to note, rather than actively mind. Music's all right, mostly nothing stood out but a few key pieces do ring nicely ♪ .It's just a shame that this otherwise competent game goes down that road and decides to do all that it does. I don't even know why it got so lazy near the end. Save time? Rush it out? It bitterly soured the experience for me. I was okay with vague story bits, unanswered things, but I was *really* not okay with 3-4 enemies showing up in the abandoned hallway out of nowhere when the solo enemy I thought I could handle called them. I hope that for Code Vein 2, they learn from these mistakes and strive to make actually difficult gameplay instead of giving up and going to such a base and insulting cop-out. All in all I only regret - and I mean outright *regret* - my last six hours with this game.I can still recommend it, the overall experience is positive still. 			"
Recommended,53.8,"																Code Vein is a very unique soulslike, at least on its artstyle and on some gameplay systems it incorporates into the soulslike genre. The artstyle is very flash and it's meant to attract fans of anime art, it's done very well and it indeed it attracted me.It could have ended there in terms of its uniqueness but the story is brought to the forefront, which is not typical on FromSoft/soulslike games, it kept me engaged throughout and the use of vestiges gives every supporting character some background and helps the player feel attached to each and every one of the characters.Combat is very responsive and the introduction of Blood Codes, which are basically ""classes"" that have different passive abilities and active spells or gifts as the game calls them, basically kept the game engaging throughout its 50 hours. There is a lot to unpack here for anyone that loves to minmax or just wants to construct a powerful build, variety is there, lots of weapons, armor that is directly correlated to the blood code a player picks.Really interesting combat/skill system coupled with a unique anime artstyle and a fascinating story makes Code Vein worth it. Replay value is there with NG+ and Depths maps.			"

Recommended,36.2,"																An entertaining action game with over the top anime esthetic, flexible build system and a serviceable narrative. Unfortunately, it is filled with odd design decisions (like not being able to do anything but walk in the memory sections, which is extremely frustrating, and an already dettached story-telling method that pushes the player against something that should be a focus point of the game. Or very weird tonal shifts. Or the redundancy of the gift mastery system). If you combine that with poor level design, a quite underwhelming enemy variety, rather poor environmental narrative... You want combat? This game has it. Anything else, doesn't come close to what Dark Souls accomplished. Then again, neither Dark Souls II nor Dark Souls III nor Elden Ring did, so that's nothing new.

Recommended,47.9,"																The Spectacular ""Anime Souls"" I Ever HadIf people are talking about Dark Souls with Anime version, this is what you're looking for. Surprisingly the combat is similiar to Dark Souls and the progression in this game is amazing. But what makes Code Vein different and if I said, ""Unique"" from Souls game? 1. StoryStory is satisfying and with ""Vestiges"", it determines your progression and way to build lore/story that can affect what ending you could get in this game.2. Combat""Blood Code"" is the way to determine your play style in this game. I'm very happy with ""Inherit"" systems, where you can inherit your Blood Code Skill, or ""Gifts"" that can be accessed from different Blood Code. Attack mechanics are unique too where ""Blood Veins"" has different drain attack and parry which may have benefit or fatal influence.3. GameplayI would say this game encourages you to explore more places, as it is will reward you with Blood Veins, Weapons, Items and Vestiges and they done well with the map design. Multiplayer in this game also has benefit and I'm very happy with it, the down side is you can't play with your friends or other player when some of the area already ""Explored"", but it's still acceptable. AI Partner is also a helpful feature to help your progression.4. MusicJust to be short, the instrument and the tone is fantastic.5. Character CreationProbably the best game with character design I ever had, as it's offer you variety option to create character as you want. Can't describe it each one, but trust me when I said you won't regret it.6.

Not Recommended,0.3,"																I actually have like 500 hours in this game from getting the platinum trophy on PS4 (400 -successful- mulitplayer sessions for that) and getting all achievements on Xbox as well.This is a great place to start playing souls-likes, I think. The combat is fast paced and you can change your class at any point, which means you can completely switch builds in 30 seconds and use any weapons or armor-- or spells and there's a bunch of those. Getting all the stuff unlocked is greatly rewarded and it really makes you want to pursue all the options. You also get a co-op partner, whose constant commentary you can now turn off (though the Japanese is kind of soothing to have around), and they will revive you if you die while they're still alive, if they don't get caught up looking at the sunset or whatever they do at those key moments. You can also revive the host in multiplayer in this same way, and even build so you can do that better, but now we have to talk about multiplayer...So, as I said, you have to have 400 successful multiplayer sessions (where you kill the boss) to get the achievement for multiplayer. So I have a crap ton of experience with this. The first thing you will notice when trying to help people is that you've become a noob in the blink of an eye. You can no longer fight properly. This is because Bando Namcai produced this game. The ever-present, yet varying in extremity, lag actually affects combat. Blows from enemies land BEFORE the attacks are launched, if you are the one coming in to assist. This means that once you have the bosses attention, all you can do is estimate their pattern if they launch every attack in the pattern, and dodge whatever that is until they turn away from you. You cannot actually fight them; you just try not to die. The result of this disability is that you have to come in with an overpowered build that lets you beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the boss quick as a flash before they can do anything to you. You have to output the maximum possible damage while they're not paying attention, because that's the only option you have, and the hosts always die at random points to random attacks from the boss if left to fend for themselves. As I said you can revive them though, so that is nice to have. You just have to be primed to do it instantly because you only get a short window for it.Now the way multiplayer is set up, and I especially do not recommend this game now since it's gotta be much more dead, is that you have to 'search for distress signals'. This means you hit the button, wait 30 seconds (or possibly 4 minutes who ♥♥♥♥♥♥' knows sometimes) for it to come back with nothing, then hit the button again and wait another 30 seconds. You cannot do anything during this time period. (Sometimes you can move, but you can't attack and you definitely can't play.) So, if you want to play multiplayer with random people in this game, you have to sit there twiddling your thumbs until you 'detect a distress signal' and get sent in to the Bamcai Nando lag-fest. If you are not playing at prime time you generally get to enter the Nandai Bamco lag dome every 5 minutes (this is when the game was newish, by the way), and all you can do while you're babysitting this stupid system is ♥♥♥♥ around on your phone. Playing with friends also has some issues because it will just fail to detect their signal repeatedly, even when you're using the same password in the same area, until eventually it works. Or you know, it doesn't and you just part ways I guess. Oh, but getting help through multiplayer isn't nearly as bad because you just start up the signal, which is the same as launching the flare in Monster Hunter, and go back to doing whatever you were doing while people pop in and out. You also get to keep your NPC partner in multiplayer, so the boss fight will actually be three versus one, so that's nice. It's not as nice for the guy helping you though because you never know if the NPC dude is actually going to revive the host player, so you can wait and pray that they do, or launch your revive instantly and hope that they don't, or what often happens where you and the NPC both spend your revive at the same time so you just get wounded (it costs health) for no reason, and then I swear to God this happens every time that happens, have the host die 5 seconds later while you can't revive them. I hotbarred a backup revive for that exact situation, later on in my 'career' with this game.But yeah, like Elden Ring, this is another fantastic game that has Bbbbbb Namco's stank on it so the multiplayer is horrible.			"
Recommended,40.5,"																TL;DR Cheap-ish anime Dark Souls copy. If you don't mind the Anime and that the game is easier than DS, I would recommend this. Try the demo first.CODE VEIN is Bandai's attempt at making a ""Souls-like"" game. Instead of putting in effort to create something really original, the development team decided to copy many aspects directly from Dark Souls. Players who have played Dark Souls will spot a lot of glaring similarities between the games. The similarities included bosses, items, characters/enemies, game areas and some story points. I wish that the effort the developers put into ""plots"" would have been spent on the story and level design. The combat feels good and is the biggest reason I bought this game. Back stabbing can feel a bit finicky at first, as the hit box might move and twist with the enemy, but you'll get used to it quickly. Leveling up is very streamlined. The only big issue I have with the mechanics of the game is unlocking new abilities. Unlocking new abilities requires you to watch a scene from someones memory. If the story was better and the designers had made unlocking multiple skill sets less cumbersome, I wouldn't mind this a much. The memory scenes can be skipped, but you'll still have to talk to a ""level-up lady"" after every unlock.The game worst part is the bad level design. Most of the areas in the game feel quite linear and bland. The developers tried to add a gimmick to each area, but I feel like they didn't make the areas any more interesting. The areas of the game are interconnect via long empty corridors that are used instead of loading screens.  Instead of making the player wait at a loading screen, the player must walk through the loading zone. The loading zone are quite laggy. The worst part might be asset reuse. The longest area of the game is  like a maze and the whole area is built using one small set of models. That area was clearly supposed to be the Anor Londo of this game, but it miserably failed to deliver the feeling it was designed to. The same model set is used for another area latter in the game. Enemies are also mostly based on a couple of base models, but as the game is quite short I didn't mind that.I was interested in the story at the beginning of the game, but quite quickly realized that I was expecting more than I should have. The characters in the game are really two-dimensional and basically do not impact the story at all. I felt like most of them were there just for the ""plot"". The story is a bit too straight-forward and didn't have a single twist in it.  I didn't feel the dread or what was at stake even though the game kind of tired to convey that.The game offers something between 20 to 40 hours of first playthrough content. It has some nice quality-of-life improvements when comparing it to Dark Souls, like automatic refilling usable item when resting at a bonfire. The character creator is really quite flexible and your character is not covered in a bunch of armor in the game, which makes character creation feel more meaningful. The game is way easier than Dark Souls. If you wish to make the game harder, you must dump your NPC companion. Your companion can heal and resurrect you multiple times which makes the game a cakewalk. I would highly recommend downloading the demo before buying. The demo contains the first dungeon of the game and some extra challenges (Depths). The challenges in the demo are harder than the same challenges in the main game. If you end up buying the full game, you can transfer your character's appearance from the demo to the full game.			"
Recommended,68.6,"																To summarize Code Vein; Its Dark Souls with a God Eater paint job. But surprisingly good. To be honest, I had been waiting on this game for a while now. It felt really long ago, so I can't accurately place a year, but it's been easily two. Back then it was described to me as ""A anime dark souls game about vampires"". Which interested me because I knew about how hard Dark Souls was and I like the anime art style in general.Over the time that passed, I had played Dark Souls Remastered and 3. I experienced first hand what it was like. And I enjoyed it. I had also played God Eater 2: Rage Burst (and God Eater 3), which was another one of their titles but with an anime aesthetic, and I enjoyed that as well (even though God Eater 3 from a story standpoint was kind of weak).It takes assets and inspiration from the Souls series and the God Eater series but It's honestly a touchy subject on which source material it takes from the most. Luckily, neither of which side of that argument I care about. Because, at the end of the day, Code Vein is still a stand alone title with a surprisingly decent story (considering how bad I thought God Eater 3 was), absolutely beautiful graphics, a good soundtrack, passable voice acting, and abso-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-lutely is it infuriating. Just like any Souls like game. I recommend.			"
Recommended,2.7,"																It's an enjoyable anime mess.That implies everything these three words imply, as I did enjoy playing through it, it is very anime, and it is also a mess in general. It sort of leaves you with a sense of disappointment, as you are seeing what you are having fun with falling to pieces, but wanting to play more of it regardless.It starts alright, it did convince me to get invested in it, with some reasonably fun-but-challenging combat, and some rather pretentious yet intriguing anime story. But as it went on, everything started to fall apart, like they fired the creative director mid-development and turned it into “yet another formulaic anime game”.As the combat eased you into it and showed general creativity in enemy designs, just as fast did it forget about all that and started to reuse assets left and right, or simply introduced horribly designed enemies and called it a day, bosses included.As the story begun with some interesting mystery going on, just as fast did it turn into a good versus evil bollocks about saving and protecting your friends and there’s no other option.And so on and so forth. It’s as if there were some good ideas while pitching this game, but not all of them went past the focus testing to actually be included in the game fully fleshed out. Some were sneaked in, served as a promise of amazing things to come, but were abandoned or turned generic.I’d be lying if said I did not enjoy it, otherwise I’d have refunded it, not have played through the whole thing once. One thing I’ll admit is that they somehow found a way to make the city setting interesting, with an incredible variety of locations in terms of design, though even that gets eaten by the wave of laziness that hit the developers while creating it at later stages.But, as I did like it, I think it is worth a recommendation. It is not amazing, and even what it does it doesn’t do it “right”, but at the very least you can look at it for the sole reason of seeing what it did wrong while enjoying what can be enjoyed.On the technical side of things, I personally had a ton of freezes and crashes which I never found a solid solution for.

Recommended,31,"																I've taken my good time to play this game and some more time to re-evaluate what I came in hoping to experience as I started this game. Having said that, here's my review as of now 18 hours into the game:The bad:Code Vein takes a lot of inspiration from the Dark Souls series when it comes to level and monster design. Unfortunately it fails to reach the same height and it doesn't go far enough to add its own unique flavour to the experience. Sometimes it feels like a cheap copy of something great. Along with bad textures and floaty controls it doesn't do well to compare it to the Dark Souls series from which it takes its inspiration.The controls are wonky and honestly pretty bad. You can change the controls but the inherent combo system won't get much better no matter regardless. It feels awkward and combos don't come together naturally. The level up system doesn't allow you much personalization or customization. Instead all you can do to make yourself a ""unique"" build is to rely on the weapons and armors that you equip, along with some skills that ultimately don't feel important or interesting. The game has an interesting story to tell, but it does a bad job telling it. Instead shoving exposition and character backstory down your throat through endless cutscenes wrapped together with a frustrating amount of loading screens. So far I have yet to experience any PvP element. It seems like invasions, one of the things a lot of people loved in the souls series was not included in this game. Which is a shame.The good:The character creation is splendid and probably the most fun I've had with character creation in any game I've played. Though it lacked certain elements I would have loved to see (difference in muscularity, nose and mouth adjustments together with some more body adjustments) I still sat through multiple hours of it. Another thing I like about the game is the ability to play with a friend. I don't know how many you can play with as I've only tried to play together with one. The game has a lot of different classes which helps you to create something that feels unique, despite the very limited and badly designed leveling system.Summary: Don't go into this game expecting anything near what Dark Souls has to offer. Play it like its own thing and play it with a friend. It's a decent game but not one I'll be remembering in the future.			"
Recommended,35.9,"																The game is good. I own this both on PC and Xbox 1. The base game is really good. Its got an alright anime story line. The combat is fun and the blood codes add a different level of depth to the character and combat. The levels can be interesting and some seem a bit uninspired. The depths are fun to an extent. Although it is much more fun due to mods. Know Ill discuss what is bad about the game. Lets start with the base game itself. The game is extremely easy for a souls like and only seems to offer any sort of challenge with one boss. The boss that is hard is only hard because its mechanics are cheep. Although it becomes easy on the next few runs of the game. Most of the weapons and armors are boring although some are really cool. Last but not least the DLC. The DLC in this game was trash. They were just one little area with one boss for each one and the rewards were just reskin weapons and armor from the base game. If there is on thing I will say is that I highly enjoy the base game but do not buy the DLC with it. It is a complete waste of money and is not worth getting. They add nothing of value whatsoever to the base game at all.			"
Recommended,82.8,"																Good game. Little clunky at times, but overall, well executed gameplay. Story is mostly just repeated anime cliches, but not terrible, and the writers genuinely try to get you to like/empathise with the characters.Hard, but not as hard as it was hyped to be. Certain sections feature noticeable difficulty spikes, but mostly, the level design/progression is well executed.Best part of the game is how you basically create your own custom class, which you can modify and add to as you proceed. You're never locked into one path, and can change your build pretty much entirely at just about any time.8.5/10			"

I wouldn't say that's a bad thing especially if you wanna use this game as an entry point for those types of games. I enjoyed the character customization. It's fun and makes it feel like you're being immersed though as anime as it is, this is a Bamco game. I've seen a few complaints here and there though I personally have not quite felt them myself, referring to graphical aspects, except one very small part in particular.

The blood code and gift systems make character builds simple to get into while maintaining some amount of complexity. The story and characters are alright, Its not exactly a literary masterpiece but it doesn't need to be.The game is balanced around having a friend or one of the AI followers with you at all times. You can beat it without any helpers, just expect it to be more difficult. The bosses and levels generally feel fair, there are a couple that have a tangible difficulty spike though. I personally like the individual level design, but the actual progression through the game is incredibly linear.The biggest problem is the fact that unlocking new gifts requires you to slowly walk through what is basically and interactive cutscene sandwiched between two long loading screens.Overall, tight mechanics make it worth playing. I would recommend buying it, probably when its on sale.			"

Recommended,36.5,"																While the early game is very easy for a soulslike, the difficulty spikes noticeably after a certain point and suddenly, all the combat customizations like blood codes, gifts, and equipment become a wonderful way to customize your play style for every enemy and environmental hazard you come across.The combat is a bit floaty, but it's also fast paced and, once you've figured out the basics, satisfying as you take chunks out of enemies.The plot is fairly straightforward and packed with anime cliches, but that's not a bad thing. The characters you meet are engaging and the story packs some emotional gut punches along the way.The character customization menu, however, outshines everything and is a true glory to behold. Getting past character creation may in fact be the most difficult boss in the game.			"

The levels, overall, are pretty boring samey-looking corridors with enemies (and lots of bottomless pits for you to be thrown or roll in), and I wouldn't really say that level design is where the game shines.

Recommended,11.1,"The enemy variety is pretty low, and you will absolutely meet reskins of enemies you saw in the beginning of the game in late game areas. Combat and boss fights can be quite fun due to the big anime weapons and the cool blood magic abilites, but all the aforementioned factors turn the game towards boring tedium most of the time... So the story cutscenes at least give you a nice feeling of ""Woohoo, I progressed!"" every time you beat a boss and finish a level. Until you stop finding a reason to keep logging in, that is.Overall, this game has a tendency of not respecting the player's time in tiny little things that just keep adding up. For example:One of the main story elements is the fact that our main character has ""Void-blood"" - meaning we don't have our own blood code (class) that we're bound to, but can absorb blood codes from others. You do this by collecting vestiges to unlock new abilities... and unlocking new gifts is one of the more tedious parts of the game. To unlock the power of a vestige, you need to ""watch"" a memory - a tiny flashback into that character's story. You get ported into a mindscape with decorations and you are locked into slow walking between flashback landmarks. Think Fallout 4 Kellogg's memories, but slower. And with dramatic music. The sad thing about this is that you can't speed anything up. You can only skip the memory outright, which, for one, is not very obvious (it's a gameplay section, after all), and of course is not ideal. If you want to actually see the story (which is pretty much the only reason to see this game through), you will have to slog though the painfully slow, scripted walking.So, now I get to best part - each vestige consists of like 4 or 5 parts. So that's how many times you need to do it for 1 blood code. And there are many blood codes to gain through these vestige shards. You can see how it adds up. Especially if you have a backlog of them.This vestige + memory mechanic of some characters is also very important for the main story itself and will affect your ending, so you can't just forego it entirely if you want the good end.Controls (and a bit on the tutorial)I harbor a thorough dislike for games that like to waste your time with remapping controls because the default ones aren't playable in the slightest. And yes, the default PC controls are horrible. Yes-yes, the game was made with controller in mind first (and plays great on the controller - no complaints here), but it doesn't excuse the absolutely baffling ` + F(1234etc) control scheme for gifts that is there by default. How is that even supposed to work? What kind of hands do you think we PC players have?! You can do better. ""It's meant for the controller"" should stop being an excuse.What's even more annoying is that the game BEGINS with a ""blank space + dummy while a voice explains to you how game work"" kind of tutorial (it's literally the first thing that happens after character creation), and now you need to figure out how to remap controls ON TOP of, frankly, all of gameplay mechanics being dumped on you right off the gate instead of fed to you organically through gameplay. This sort of tutorials is another pet peeve of mine. One would think they should be a thing of the past since they are just not that helpful. For me, personally, such an approach results in fragmented knowledge. I basically just end up not using the mechanics I did not understand. What that means is when I played Code Vein for the first time, I ended up heavy rolling around with a Zweihander and my boi Yakumo, because thankfully if you have brute force and determination, you don't need any skill.CompanionsIn Code Vein, you pretty much always play with an NPC companion. Of course, you can play solo if you want a challenge, but it is quite obvious from the beginning that the game doesn't want you to be alone and is designed with a companion/co-op in mind. You will start off your playthrough with a companion by your side, and as soon as you lose one, you will find another one soon after. I spent my whole time playing this game with Yakumo, because him's hot with a big ash sword. And he... can dish it out, oh boy. It sometimes feels like he's carrying all the damage. I haven't tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised that if you played a support character, he could solo the game for you. Some would probably say the game isn't even hard because of this.On a side note though, when I returned to the game and realised that you can have ""quick"" movement speed, instead of heavy rolling with a big bonk weapon I decided to dash around with a bayonet. Did you know that if you are shooting at a target, Yakumo will stand between you and that target and block, protecting you from incoming attacks? I didn't, and I found it beyond cute. He's such a sweetheart."

This way you can really close your eyes on the flaws of the game that happens after the character creation screen. Yes, it's a big game with some interesting systems that can scratch your souls itch, but the reason it's big is mainly because it's padded out with uninspired levels. If you don't mind that, and are interested in the story, then maybe give it a try.			"

Recommended,95.2,"																I am still playing blind at this point, and I am 21 hours into playing as of this review.  It's pretty good so far, Expect it to be extremely anime, in the dialogue, design, and story. The beginning bit is very ""My friends are my power!"" cringe, but it tapers away and the story becomes rather intriguing.I don't know how far into the game I am right now, but I am past the dreaded Cathedral of the Sacred Blood. It's a pretty mind numbing if you're alone, so I suggest sending a distress signal once you realize how convoluted and daunting it can be at times. You may or may not wish to re-bind your controls a bit if you come from Souls games. I personally didn't. I got used to the differences quite fast.This is an anime souls-like experience that is entirely PvE. I think it was worth my money, but some may not.			"

Recommended,21.5,"																Anime Souls. 10/10.The Good:The difficulty varies throughout, but climbs steadily, especially during solo play. The game can feel a bit underwhelming in coop for an experienced souls-borne player. The AI team mate was a bit of a concern initially, but I found that the allies function in much the same fashion as a soft feather pillow does when lying on a cold hardwood floor. The game is hard, but at least you had a pillow to rest your head on.Story-wise, it a polished anime-tastic drama with all of the beauty and some of the awkwardness that comes with it.Art-Style is top notch, with the variance in Drain and Back Stab animations being a very nice touch, which adds even more satisfaction to landing those parries and sneaky boi stabs. Character Creation is a blast, with enough nonsense to keep you busy for hours if you're into that sort of thing. Want your hat's hat to look more dapper? Give your hat's hat a hat, so it can look classy while keeping your hat's hat looking fresh. Wanna walk around as a giant burnt marshmallow monster? You can do that too. See screenshots for details. Combat is nice and smooth, and I think this game has a really nice Melee vs Magic balance, with an absurd number of build options and ways to customize your moveset to fit your perfect style of murderous rampage. Combo-ing magic feels great, combo-ing melee abilities feels great. Multiplayer is incredibly streamlined compared to souls, and dropping in and out of a friend's game only takes a couple seconds, literally. I would have liked to have seen a friend take the place of the AI ally, instead jumping in additively, as that would increase the difficulty, and add more opportunity for teamwork via the support/life giving abilities. I do feel like having the AI plus a human ally makes things a little too forgiving, allowing for more careless hack'n slash playing rather than the souls-like dance of dodging and attacking at opportune moments. Also, allowing for more players couldn't have hurt either. I typically play in groups of 3 when playing souls games, so having to ditch one of my buds was difficult. Scaling difficulty for multiple human players wouldn't seem like too hard a thing to implement.Shortcomings: My only true complaints thus far stem from perhaps a too forgiving mistake system, and the lack of pvp/invade mechanics. The memetastic and magical random invades from the souls series were a large part of what made souls games fun, post story, and gave them their longevity. Never knowing when someone was going to pop into my game to murder me was an exciting feeling. I understand that balancing pvp would probably completely destroy the game play they have in place, but I can't help but feel a sense of emptiness at the thought that I've spent hours designing a monstrosity of a character, with no one to murder with it. Why take to the time to stack hats on hats, if no one gets to spend their last moments (and their souls) watching me emote over their fading corpse?All things considered, I give this game a 10/10, and hold it with the same high regard as the Dark Souls series. I have found myself already craving more content, and though I have not beaten it yet, I'm already living with dread and anxiety for when it ends. Finally something to sate my endless hunger for more ""souls"".			"

Recommended,7.8,"																SHORT REVIEW:  DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE A SOULS-LIKE EXPERIENCE, ITS DIFFERENT.I totally recommend this game if you like anime and the Dark Souls-like theme. I really liked the lore, the characters, the concept and the way it ended. It is in no way perfect but for me it was worth my money (bought the game on sale though).  Score: 7.5/10LONG REVIEW:Very good Souls-like game. You can see all the inspiration it got from DarkSouls, HOWEVER, do not expect to play a Souls game here. It has its level of difficulty but nothing compared to a Souls game. I barely die on my entire playthrough. This is a good thing, because you can focus more on the story and exploring without worrying too much. It is a heavy story driven game, so expect various cinematics and dialogues. Because of this you will understand what is going on from the start. It has cool characters and interesting lore behind them too. My only concern might be the combat, it's not bad but it doesnt feel as impactful as I am used to in games like Dark Souls but it was good enough for me to enjoy the game.			"
Recommended,61.1,"																Too Long, Didn't ReadHave you ever wanted your Dark Souls to artificially slow you down through literal waist-high swamp water and quicksand? Have you ever wanted an uninspired Anor Londo copy that has more doors and ladders than it does enemies? Have you ever wanted those bonfires to be spaced twenty miles apart so you had to walk back for several minutes every death?Code Vein allows you to pay $60 to relentlessly torture yourself with everything above while also providing a overwrought narrative that puts modern Shōnen to shame. The combat is clunky and uninspiring, even though convoluted, and the progression system is a slog.Dark Souls may have taught you to have an iron will and persevere through the most dreadful challenges, but it never prepared you for this abuse. Would recommend saving your money and finding something else to spend your time on.Full ReviewThe StoryEarth is suddenly engulfed by gigantic thorns that pierce through the ground. They are the Thorns of Judgement. What does that mean? Who knows. Due to these thorns existing, monsters suddenly appear. Why? Again, who knows. "
Recommended,26.7,"The best way for Earth to fight these monsters is to toss parasites into humans and make them into vampires called Revenants. In typical fashion, Revenants need blood to survive. This nourishment becomes scarce, however, and starved vampires turn into the Lost."
Recommended,54.2,"The Lost, being mutated and ravenous monsters, are motivated to kill whatever moves. But they also exude a deadly miasma. You play as a Revenant that can clear this miasma and your task is to find sustenance in the form of Blood Beads and kill enemies Dark Souls-style.Things that aren't memorable here: The story.  The characters. The dialogue.Things that are memorable here: Having to walk at -90% movement speed through boring interactive memoriesHow many times do those memories occur? Often. The fundamental ability-gathering of the game is constantly rife with memories that take twenty minutes to tell a one minute tale. Sure, you can skip it. But if you want any narrative at all, you'll have to sit through dozens of them.The characters are boring and uninspired. They are caricatures of terrible anime tropes; along with backstories and dialogue that'll prove this point. At a certain point, I skipped just about everything the game would allow me to as it was that soul-crushingly awful.The story feels like a fan-fiction written by a thirteen-year old. In standard pubescent lechery, the actual plot is lost about halfway through chapter one to make room for the several female characters that'll wear scantily-clad clothing and have their breasts nearly popping out of their tops.If you are looking for anything enriching, this ain't gonna be it.The EnvironmentCode Vein does everything it can to shield itself from how short their game actually is. Since bosses are relatively easy and enemies all have the same three moves that are mastered by the end of the first act, players would finish it in reasonable enough time.But that's just not good enough. So, a quarter of the way through the game, you'll have to wade through swamp water that'll decrease your movement speed substantially. Maybe the next act will be better, you might ask. Nope! It's a maze of stairs and ladders that takes at least three hours.There's a flame level that forces you to heal every twenty seconds because every mandatory path is covered in fire that is as unavoidable as it is dangerous. The level after that forces you to wade through quicksand that's even slower than the swamp water from before.At a certain point, it feels more like you're fighting with the game than the actual enemies themselves. Constantly trying to find ways to squeeze a little more speed from your character while becoming exhausted by how far apart the spawn beacons are.What might have been a very interesting and captivating look into the environment is constantly soured by the fact that you constantly have just a little bit more to go. Often, you'll feel compelled to just turn off the game because it acts like a chore the majority of the time.The CombatMost abilities or mechanics in the game are either fundamentally weak or just plan unneeded. I've used the same weapon from the first act just upgraded and transformed. There was never a reason for me to use anything in my inventory aside from the actual healing ability.There might be certain enemies that might be easier by imbuing certain buffs onto your weapons, but I never really found myself hitting that hard of a wall that I needed to reevaluate really anything in my arsenal. It just felt convoluted for no reason.Usually, the walls that you'll hit have nothing to do with buffing or debuffing. It's more a consequence of the enemy mechanics themselves as they're often too fast to give you any opportunity to either (a) hit more than once or (b) heal yourself after being wounded.It creates a scenario where almost every enemy is just dash-dash-dash-hit. Even the smallest enemies turn into mini-bosses that you have to begrudgingly fight through to get to an even more boring boss using the same mechanics with larger hit-boxes.It's tolerable enough, but it's definitely nothing to write home about. OverallEmpty world with an even emptier cast. The flawed nature of nearly every aspect of the game is immediately noticeable upon launch and the only redeemable thing about the game is probably the soundtrack. Which you can access for free on YouTube.Don't buy it and spend your money elsewhere.			"

Recommended,51.2,"																Haven't started the game yet, was too busy making my character. Will update soon.			"
Recommended,55.3,"																I wish I could be more conditional for this review. Take my ""Yes"" with a HUGE grain of salt. I don't regret buying this game, but I also don't know that I'll sink much single-player time into it with all the variety of other games I have available to me. If you don't want to read the deets (they're spoiler-free beyond comparisons to similar-but-not-the-same games and anime) you can skip to the bulleted stuff at the end.My Trepidation for Your Experience:At its core, Code Vein is a mildly perverted conglomerated rip-off of several things. My brother pointed out to me that there are some stark parallels to the anime Tokyo Ghoul. The game's mechanics are mostly built around (read: nearly directly ripped off from) Dark Souls' combat system. In playing the game with others, I've been told about how the few things I didn't see as ripped off from other media were in fact ripped off from other media, I just hadn't seen / played those titles yet. Speaking of titles ... the huge tracts of land that the first NPC you encounter outside of the tutorial happens to be sporting are nearly as capable of destroying your suspension of disbelief as the Zweihander sword in the game being casually held over one of the character's shoulders, despite it being apparent that the thing would weigh fifty pounds at best. I suppose that's another parallel to the aforementioned titles that the NPC pushes into your face at various moments. So, long story short: this game is a cobbled together mish-mash of Chester the Cheetah level dangerously cheesy anime tropes, stolen ""it worked for them!"" game mechanics that are satisfactory but which pale in comparison to the origin material, and enough cut scenes that it makes you wonder if an anime studio wanted to make a miniseries but could only get funding for a game instead. All of that is taped together with enough sexually suggestive material that I would hardly be surprised if somewhere further down the line it crosses said line into full on softcore hentai. Positive Notes:If none of this really makes you take significant pause, then I think you'll enjoy the game, simple as it is. Visually, it's often quite stunning... though simple. The levels are simple, but they're interesting. The characters are not simple, and look pretty cool/interesting. The customization is RIDICULOUSLY deep. I spent around an hour working on my character before I ever played the game.Depends on Your Tastes:This game is definitely (though often fairly subtly) perverted, and it's not at all ashamed of the fact.Though the levels are interesting, they're not terribly complex.Pay-to-Win features from the Deluxe Edition include an overtuned NPC who does massive ranged damage and can revive you by sacrificing a small amount of her health with what feels like a < 10 second cooldown. Stealth / Backstab mechanics are present, but so minimal that it doesn't even feel like that's what they are.You don't get i-frames from dodging. If you didn't get out of the way, you're getting hit. I suppose depending on your connection speed, your might be getting hit even if you did get outta the way.No PvP that I'm aware of. While not getting constantly invaded is a plus, (I'm lookin' at you, Undead Settlement...) there's nothing to even elect any kind of PvP. (Again, that I'm aware of. I'm not terribly far into the game at this juncture.)The game difficulty is like returning to Kindergarten after getting your Master's Degree comparatively easy if you are a veteran Souls player. Pros:Feels like a Souls game sometimes, utilizing many of the same mechanics.Character customization is incredibly deep, but far easier to use than say... Soul Caliber.Unlike many of the recently released games I've played, I have barely noticed any immersion-breaking issues with connectivity while enjoying the multiplayer aspect of the game.Speaking of the multiplayer: It is pretty fun, overall. It's definitely what's kept me playing it thus far. Cons:Leading into the cons list from the last 'Pro' listed above: With how fulfilling the multiplayer aspect can be, it sure is crazy that this game is only cooperative for two players.Have I mentioned how simple this game is? It's as wide as an ocean and deep as a shower closet. Lots of promising stuff that just never really sees anywhere near its full potential. It feels a little... ahem... Soulless, because it clearly ended up a box of ""Oops! All homages!"" instead of adding its own flavor or spin to the video game equivalent of a high school band's Nine Inch Nails cover. Just like when you leave the concert and put the real NiN on your car sound system, the first time I played this game I just wanted to go play Dark Souls 3 again some more.So far at least, this game is just ""sexy"" enough to be awkward to play around some people, (""Hi, grandma!"",) without even culminating in any kind of significant hotness. It's like a person's first intimate relationship, where their partner teases them but has no idea what they're supposed to do next, even if they want to. (They want to.)The dialogue is often worse than I've ever experienced with even the most watered down, cheesy, English-dubbed, edited-for-TV anime.TL;DR:Wait for it to go on sale. I bought it for around $20 and it was worth about that to me, nothing more.I hope you enjoyed my review. If you take a chance on this game, note that you can play a Demo version of it first, which I understand allows you to save your intricately customized character for visual import into the full version when you buy it.

Recommended,100.5,"																game too hard, never got past the character creation menu.on a serious note - there is a lot that i like about the game and a little that i do not like. So i'll start on the good and move to the bad. The good;- adaptive gameplay, if you like to be agile and swift, you can do so. however if you want to just beat down some poor fleshbag with an anime-sized sword, you can do that as well. - replay-ability with the new game plus system. - unique map designs and ideas- clean combos and fighting animations- story line was good, if not a bit rushed- Sudo-open-world-Characters are well made and look great-the visceral attacks and animations are very cool.The bad;-highly complicated menu at first sight with little information- i'm still trying to figure out how to raise roll weight (if it is % based, then my copy is bugged and capped at 50 units limiting my armor choices to low weight ivy and swords for fast mobility)- jumping from heights can result in various results, you can either A; travel a small distance outwards and straight down, or B travel at a large distance and often off a cliff or missing your platform.- all of the maps are made exceptionally well... except the blood cathedral... that place is a maze upon a maze upon a maze upon a maze. the layout is HIGHLY complex and took the majority of my first playthrough (28 hours or so).-for the first playthough mages are super fun, however afterwards they begin to lack in damage compared to using a halberd or one handed sword. -balance is about as useful as poise in DS3, not very.-after NG 3, there are few VIABLE fighting options.-the DLC's are ONE MAP and ONE BOSS for $10, there is also no story to them, and are purely for the extra challenge they provide. do i like this game; YESis there much to be desired; YESdo i wish for PVP; YES			"

However, for me that doesn't really like story based games and like MMORPG types, this was really nice, you can customize the character you want, and with people that have an oc, my character has a pink and blue eye, so it can be different colours. Hopefully you'll try this game out, it is confusing if you don't have a friend who hasn't played it to help you get along the road.			"

Recommended,58.4,"																This game has more hats than the Queen of England. And they're not hidden in lootboxes. You pay for a game, you get a complete game, what a concept!The strongest part of the gameplay, in my opinion, is the vast number of options you have with all the skills, armor, weapons and 'classes' that you can switch between at will. Lots of room to experiment, which I needed for several of the infuriatingly hard bosses. Mind you, that's coming from someone to scared to even try Dark Souls.I encountered one large bug that had me stuck, but the devs fixed it with a quick update. I think the real quality of a game is in the level of support it gets from the developers. They seem to stand behind their game. And they should, because it's good.			"
Recommended,77.2,"																As a new player on this genre (Dark souls like genre), this has been an amazing experience. This game is great for new players with it's partner mechanism, it helps to introduce us the world of failing over the same area/boss multiple times, but not as rough as other titles. Failing over multiple times, grinding for the things I want, and finally dominating enemies with the result of my hundreds deaths rewards me with such an amazing feeling of accomplishment and I would do it again. For the visual, it was truly great. The character customization is an important aspect of this game, you will see your character not only while exploring the game, but also during cut scenes. Your armor (Known as blood veil in the game) is a huge part of your appearance with the many choices of colors, styles, and animations, which will differentiate the vibe your gives, a stealth assassin or an alpha male/female. The combat mechanism is close to perfect in my opinion. There are a lot of different builds you can go for. You can be a mage, a two-handed sword user, or even a bayonet player, but the best part is the active skills could be mixed and matched to create a new style to play. Regarding the difficulty, players like me who wants to play to chill can fully utilize the partner mechanism to relax in this kind of game. For others who want a harder experience or comes from other games, they can remove their partner and the difficulty would drastically change, resulting in a huge different from before. The cons of this game is that there are some things that I never get to use. There are lots of consumables in this game, yet the only ones I use has always been heal and increased resistance. The other items seems great to use but I never got the chance because I find them to be more of an extra fun items rather than an actual assist items. A bug (Probably?) I found was that sometimes when I tried to run (Left Shift + W) my character would rather do an attack move (Left Shift + Left mouse button) even when I was walking before pressing the run key. This only happened once during combat luckily, the other 10+ times happened after the fight but it was still annoying. I think this game is designed to be more friendly towards controller users (Haven't tried using it for this game). Overall this game is perfect for newcomers and great for veterans. Whether you are into Japanese culture/anime or not, to play this game and enjoy it is something that everyone could experience. Bought this for full price and I find it worth, if this game is on sale I would highly recommend to buy it immediately. 			"

Making up strategies on how to fight bosses, exploring every inch of the map to find amazing loot. For gods sake, you are literally playing through an anime with good cutscenes and interesting story with emotional parts. Little hints at romance too is appreciated. A lot of replayability value to get all the endings, and maybe change around your playstyle.There is so much variation and hybrid builds you can make that's unique to you. I honestly think this is my game of the year as I'm a huge anime fan. Defo recommend as I'm going into my NG+. See ya!			"
Recommended,73.6,"																Code Vein reminds a lot of Bloodborne for PS4 or even Dark Souls. Even though it's animated, and you can create your own waifu's, the gameplay and the story itself is amazing on how it pieces it all together. It may seem confusing at first; asking yourself ""what is going on?!"", the answers become clear the more you progress. With only 42 hours into the game, and multiple hours of watching others play or stream (including speed runs), it still has a hold on me to continue playing. I'm still only on NG+ and slowly taking my time through the map this time rather than getting through the story mode.One thing I would like to say that when you enter NG+, I absolutely LOVE that the map stays uncovered; you still have to activate the mistle's but it's nice to see where I'm going, especially in the Cathedral... it has even given me time to learn the Cathedral map.I would recommend anyone of my friends, or even a random stranger I just met to try out this game.

IF you don't have a console, then play it on PC. You will still enjoy it. The appearance customization is very fun but it has too many glitches unlike other games that offer this kind of customization. Many times I have seen the hair glitch out if it is incompatible with the hat/some other accessory that you have given your character.			"
Recommended,21.7,"																Sound: Good musical scores and decent sound effects, weapons have solid and impactful feel.Graphics : Good graphics and animation. Although there is quite a number of clipping problems in some of the cutscenes.Gameplay: Having a partner AI makes the game alot easier, I would recommend not having a partner if you're looking for a Souls-like experience. The customization where you can mix and match different skills and basically build your own class to fit your style allows for alot of creativity and fun. There's also the potential for building really OP builds that makes the game very easy. The game can get very challenging when it throws 3 or more foes at you at once and they all hit very hard. Most people don't bother trying to parry in this game as the timing on it isn't useful in frantic fights, so dodging and blocking are used more often and worked into more successful builds. The boss fights are frequently not that difficult, I pretty much beat the majority of the bosses on the first try thanks to my helpful AI partner who keeps the boss distracted. Again, remove the AI partner if you want a tough boss fight.Story: For a Souls-like game, this actually has a very good story and characters that feel meaningful and not static window dressing.

WHY it's not needed this just limits to much customization please remove this im not asking for more slots just remove that annoying cost amount Anywho now that is out of the way here is my review:Pros:The Story is very easy to immerse you're self into very well written easy to follow lots of moment where i was tear jerked  ,some moments that i was very angry and there some things that will blow you mind ! but ill leave that for you to find out for you're self -.^ 10/10For the Combat let's just say it fun some of the mechanics will leave you scratching you're head but that will not happen often almost all weapon offer unique abillities that are fun to use ill give the combat a 9/10 Customization for on thing is a double edged sword it's pretty good but limiting is some ways some thing you would like to create but held back by the cost of accessories clothing could use  some more variaty and skin color should be alot more vast then what they allow you to chose also they should let us change the color of our mask why we can't is beyond me but with all the back comes with the good and yes there's is still a lot of ways to create and amazing looking CAC i have spent hours just making new looks for my CAC for that i can only give this part a 8/10 if they end up fix / remove some aspects of the CAC creator ill change it to 10 /10Story Characters let me tell you just WOW very well done in telling each and individual character in there own way they really captivate there emotion and feel of the characters they could use some facial expressions tho i give this a 9.5/10 the .5 is really just the lack of facial expresionNow For the Cons:The areas the you play in lack the graphical details but none the less is still pretty there are also some bug with elevators you might run into all you need to do is be patient it will eventually move  but for this i give it a 7.5/10Lost originality this part lacks a lot there's is not much of a unique aspect in the enemies you fight very bland as in mostly re skins and throw big numbers at you but i am willing to look past this since all other aspects make up for this short coming i give this a 6/10Now for the biggest down fall for this game IMOThe multiplayer since its a dark souls alike game i can understand why they did it like this but i can not except that when you help someone you will be kicked out of there game when completing the final boss of the area that is just annoying at best , other then that you also get kicked out when you die when you go help someone now for  a random person you're help i can agree to this but with you're playing with friend its just annoying to have to re connect together every time something does not work out .another thing is the lvl scaling i don't know how many times i have joined someone that is seriously under lvled for the boss there doing leaving us to not get hit once since they will one shot you without even trying this also leads into the next issue lag even tho this game has a really good net code it will still have slight lag spikes and they always seem to happen when you need it the most so when you're playing with someone on a very low lvl it is very annoying i know this can't be altered since just imagine some one lvl 100+ going into some that only lvl 20 ish the fights would be to easy  but there is one way they could fix this and that is to scale the mobs to the client side and not just the host that would make it so you can play just like you have in solo modeanother thing is why can't you have your friends join in to you're home base that makes no sense at all or even trying to join some one to help them you need to be out in the world to even play or use multiplayer at all Well after all this ranting i do recommend the game yes this game does has some issues but very worth getting the game for even just the story			"

Recommended,412.2,"																Edit: sometimes when you fall, you fall all the way down. That's what this game does best.This game isn't good. It isn't terrible. It's mediocre with good elements and glaring flaws. Where the character creator, combat and systems are relatively good, that's kinda where it ends. The story is kinda meh. It's just kinda there. There's nothing interesting about it. Characters decide to have random backstory dumps at odd times, which can be very jarring at points. Where the game seems to somewhat care about the characters, it cares very little about the world itself, giving a paper thin backstories as to why the events that we've seen have happened, but completely neglecting to explain why you're running around an apocalyptic metropolis that looks like it has been hit by every natural disaster known to man, at least once each.There's very little in terms of outfits for your character in comparison to other character elements (to begin with at least), which is pretty disappointing given the many options for other aspects of your character. The game gives you the ability to toggle individual elements or an outfit on or off. This at least allows you to make all the overly extravagant outfits into something a bit more minimal. This doesn't really solve the lack of options for outfits.A lot of the enemies have weapon swings that reach significantly behind them on both sides, meaning you practically have to roll for every attack and there are no reliable ""safe spots"". Some enemies have stupid long attack ranged with melee attacks that you expect from a boss, not an early game mob. Each level has a small pool of enemies, maybe with a couple of different weapons if they use them. which are copy-pasted everywhere in those levels, which results in very little variety and pretty boring gameplay. The game gives you NPC follower to help you throughout levels, but I often found that where I played cautiously, the NPC would jump in and kill everything. Backstab angles are far more forgiving than DS. A lot of the issues with the combat result in either feelings of ""wat"" or ""well that was so easy it was boring"". All the feelings of excitement and adrenaline you get from playing DS just aren't here. If that's what you're looking for, look for something else. You won't find it here. If you're just looking for another action RPG, then this exists I guess, but there are better options. If you're looking for a co-op game, then you should know that this game functions similarly to DS. It's a bearable co-op system on top of a mediocre, yet very flawed game. No matter what angle you're coming from, my recommendation is still to look somewhere else (unless you're just looking for anime dark souls, in which case, guess this fits the bill on an aesthetic level).

Recommended,146.7,"																 Gameplay This anime soulslike game not as hard as Dark Souls, but still consider as hard. The story gameplay needs 20 - 30 hours to complete except you're a speedrunner who keep moonwalking. There are 5 types of Weapon and Blood Veils, which affect the drain attack. Every weapon has it's own unique ""attack"" and sometimes it needs ichor. And Blood Veils has variety of drain attack, parry, backstab, and that focus attack (or anything, I forget the term for that). There are The close-ranged ""Ogre"". The long-ranged tail ""Stinger Blood"", ""Hound Blood"" which good for parrying but heavies among of those, and lightest Ivy Blood with unique Charge Drain and the ""Area of Effect"". There are also ""Blood code"" that will affect the statistics and the Gift (spell) some of Gifts can be used on every blood code which needs to maxed out the Proficiency first, also there are some Exclusive Gifts that can only used on specific Blood code. Story Starting from an apocalyptic event ""The Great Collapse"" which almost caused humans to become extinct. However, there are some scientists who have succeeded in making cells that can turn humans into ""Revenants"", the Vampire-like creature. Revenants do not eat human food, they drink human blood and will experience a Frenzy phase if they do not drink human blood. If they have reached the Frenzy phase and are still not given blood, they will become Lost, which is a monster who is our enemy in this game. You, the main character will wake up without memory next to the unknown white girl. And the journey start from here. There are 3 endings which you can achieve with  either restore the Successor's Vestige or not . The Good Ending can be achieve by  Restore/Repair all Successor's Vestige before fighting them . The second Good Ending can be achieve the same way with the first, but you'll need to  restore all Eos Vestige too . The Neutral Ending (probably most of people got this ending on first gameplay) can be achieve by  Restore/Repair some of the Successor's Vestige . The Bad Ending, you can just  fight all Successors without restore/repair their Vestige . After you complete the story, you can start the story again with the same level and equipment. You can choose between the same difficulty or the enhanced Graphics and Soundtrack I don't know what to say, but the graphics quite good. I have mid-end device run the game with 30 - 60 FPS, I play on Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 14ARE05, Ryzen 7 4700U (Vega 7 Renoir) if you wonder, and play on 720p with Medium-Low setting except the Texture is Highest. The BGM is good too, I love the tutorial BGM and the Choir on Main Menu. My Impression This is a good game for someone who likes souls-like game, but not that hard so you can play this game without tryhard as dark souls. I kinda hate the delay parry animation which makes parry a little harder. The hardest boss is actually Cannoneer and Blade Bearer Cathedral is the most liked map on the entire community 			"

Recommended,103.7,"																If there was a button between Thumbs up and Thumbs down I would press it.Very mediocre soulslike filled to the brim with edgy storytelling, melodramatic monologues and weapons double as big as the character. Or to sum it up in a question: ""What if Dark Souls was anime, but we add vampires and this fanfic of my moody 15y/o brother who has his ""xXDarkShadowkillerXx""-phase?""Either you enjoy this game by taking it 100% seriously and sink into the storytelling or you laugh your ass off by how overly dramatic yet senseless everything is. I did it the second way.The gameplay is sadly very underwhelming, it's very similar to Dark Souls with dodge rolls, blocks, parrys and abilities, but it barely matters because enemy attacks are often too simple and npc movement is pretty hard to read/predictpros:+ edgy as hell, just watch the intro and you know what you're in for. Can be super entertaining+ beautiful models and environments, also really nicely designed clothes and characters+ beautiful theatrical music+ VERY huge character creator (but for some odd reason there's no beards at all. I mean come on, even with a mask you can have some kind of beard)+ fighting with a sword that is almost double the size of your character is fun- despite the seemingly big variation of skills and classes, gameplay is quite dull and easy- levels are just tubes, very boring sadly- 70% of the game's music is one song that is played over and over and over again. Had to deactivate ""music"" in the settings after a couple of hours because that ""opera voice""-song just kept popping up- edgy as hell, everybody has a dramatic, dark past, everybody is sad, everybody wears variations of black- monster designs are extremely dull, your typical spiky anime demons with typical anime demon voices- there is SO much empty talking with anime trope topics like ""what are we living for?"" or ""I can't forget the past!""- whenever you recover a memory you have to play a little walking simulator where a small story is told, feels more like little fanfics of ppl being all ""uh, my sad past :("". And guess what, every single one of them has the mentioned ""opera voice""-song. And there's probably around 40 of those sequences in the game, sooo I hope you like walking sequences! Sadly you need to play those because you receive a skill afterwards. Felt a bit like a mobile game where you have to endure a commercial to get a benefit lateron- mediocre animations, but that's sadly kind of a standard with games from japan- tries a bit too hard to be dark souls (ambushes, shortcuts, elemental upgrades increase elemental dmg but decrease the core dmg of the weapon, bonfires, etc etc)It wasn't really fun, you know, okay-ish, mildly entertaining. If you dig anime styled visuals and soulslikes then you might have a try, but please don't expect much of it, it's more of that kind of game you play when you don't really have anything better to do5/10, mildly entertaining vampire dark souls 15y/o fanficOh oh and before I forget, curse the guy who came up with the cathedral level, god that was agonizingly terrible to play			"

Recommended,47.8,"																Biggest issue is combat for me, it just feel clunkyDodge type is based on weight which means you have slow, normal and quick blink(fast). iframes are fine for 1v1 add multiple projectile or multiple enemies and dodge feels awful.Parry exist but you have to parry before the enemy has attacked but not to soon and not to late. By this i mean it feels off you dont click it when it feels right.Backstabs is the most consistent mechanic but i dont know when it works and when it wont... get behind enemy click normal attack if you dont get backstab quickly dodge and try again.Stagger mechanicThis is propaply the biggest reason for the game feeling clunky. So every enemy(not bosses) has a meter that build up from attacks. So you hit something with a big hammer and the enemy wont care until the meter has been completed. Once the meter is full that dosent mean the enemy is powerless, it will stagger for a few moments and then attack again.Skills and status effectsI would split up skills into 4 categories-big damage, I Would say this is the most useful to deal with high health enemies-status effects, not very useful but is usually cheap and low effort-crowd control/stagger build up, used to knock down trash or build up the stagger on higher health enemies-buffs, more damage,more defense etcSo most effective method is the backstab on everything that isnt a boss. Does the most damage and is the easiest to pull off.Level design was fine except one area that the game itself called a maze but it was mostly just infuriating.Story was fine, nothing to be wow´dI cant recommend this game since it falls short on everything it is trying to do, its a solid 4/10			"

Recommended,105.8,"																Code Vein: A Dark Souls-Inspired Adventure for Anime LoversIn Code Vein, you rise as a vampire and embark on a journey to remember your own past and uncover the mystery of the Red Mist. This hack and slash game combines the fast-paced gameplay of God Eater with the challenging difficulty and mechanics of the Dark Souls series, resulting in a unique and enjoyable gaming experience that's both fun and challenging. In this game, you play as a vampire, or Revenant, who has lost their memories. Guided by a mysterious girl in white, you join a group of Revenants to unravel the origins of the Great Collapse.The gameplay in Code Vein focuses on hack and slash combat, allowing you to confront enemies head-on and even perform backstab attacks at times. In an attempt to mirror the mechanics of the Dark Souls or Soulsborne series, the game introduces a forgiving feature for players new to these types of games: companions. Companions are there to assist you on your journey, particularly in battles, as they can attack and draw enemy aggro, making the game more accessible than many entries in the Soulsborne series. Most companions can also revive you (and vice versa), but this comes with a cooldown period. While this feature is invaluable, the revival animation takes some time, highlighting the importance of timing.The presence of companions can be disabled, creating a more challenging solo experience for those seeking greater difficulty. Each companion possesses unique abilities and fighting styles. Some are frontline fighters who draw enemy attention but deal lower damage, while others attack from a distance with guns and gifts (magic), keeping you safe but needing your defense. There are also well-rounded fighters. You can also engage in cooperative play by inviting other players to join your journey, essentially making them your companions. While I personally haven't used this feature, it's worth exploring for those who enjoy cooperative play.Code Vein offers a wide range of weaponry, diverse gifts (magic), Blood Codes, and Blood Veils, allowing for nearly limitless customization of your playstyle. Blood Codes primarily determine your stats, which you can focus on when building your unique style. They also unlock gifts associated with that Blood Code, eventually making these gifts accessible to all Blood Codes. Although unlocking all gifts can be somewhat grindy, you can concentrate on unlocking those that align with your desired playstyle. Whether you wish to build a magician vampire capable of ranged attacks, a sword-wielding character dealing heavy close-range damage, or a tank who relies on your companion for damage, the possibilities are extensive.The game's difficulty and boss battles are manageable for newcomers while providing a satisfying challenge for Soulsborne veterans. The maps in the game, although at times appearing vast, sometimes feel like reskins of each other. For instance, the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, while visually striking with its white color scheme, bears a resemblance to Crypt Spire. It's a minor issue, but one that can be bothersome. Fortunately, the game offers plenty to explore. You can discover secret maps and fragments that unlock memories and gifts, making map exploration highly rewarding. The map design also allows for unlocking hidden or blocked paths, reducing the inconvenience of backtracking.One notable feature worth mentioning is how the story is presented. Throughout the game, you'll come across memory fragments that serve two purposes. Firstly, they allow you to unlock and upgrade Blood Codes for your use. Secondly, they help you recall and experience the past of related characters. The story is portrayed as frozen moments while the accompanying voiceovers narrate the events. Some may find this storytelling approach somewhat boring, but others, including myself, appreciate the uniqueness it brings to the game.In conclusion, Code Vein is not without its flaws, but it offers solid and enjoyable gameplay. Some enemies can be challenging, often ganging up on you, but the presence of companions can provide significant assistance. While the base game is highly enjoyable, the DLC content may not be as worthwhile, as it primarily consists of boss reskins with inflated stats.IO is best girl			"

Recommended,4.1,"																This game aspires to be a soulsborne game but has a few key differences that might make it more palatable and less punishing to those seeking a more consistent and smoother gaming experience. There isn't as much customization in general traits; they increase with the level and then alter based on which type of Revanent you choose to fight as. Weapon drops aren't as difficult either. It's a fun, somewhat of a less straining adventure game. The story is interesting but not cumbersome.			"

Flashback cutscenes wich you get when you watch characters memories are made in a very lazy way - you walk around in the darkness and see idle figures of characters talking. Some enemies have very wide weapon hitboxes and can hit you behind their back, wich is annoying. During second half of the game I`ve encountered location, wich was too big, and it took too much time to beat it, so i`ve become bored to be in it. Otherwise I`ve enjoyed the game, and was nicely surprised when I`ve discovered that game takes place in the same universe as godeater series.

Recommended,59.3,"																It's anime Dark Souls.So if you like both anime and Souls-like games then check it out, download the demo and give it a go. Definitely worth getting during a sale.If you hate anime, then you better skip this. The story is a overly melodramatic, the character and enemy designs look like they were made by horny teenagers. If this bothers you then you won't have a good time. On the other hand there's no romance, no sex scenes, so if that is what you're looking for, again probably not your thing.The game differs from Dark Souls in that you can have a partner for the fights. The partner is competent but won't do everything for you. So you still have to master the various gameplay mechanics, simple buttonmashing won't get you through the entire game. The demo has a section where you must fight alone, this will not happen in the main game. However you can choose to fight alone if the game is too easy with a partner.You gain XP from killing enemies, this can be used to 1: level up 2: buy gear (I almost never did, mostly everything you need is just drops)3: upgrade gear (necessary)4: unlock class abilities.Class abilities have two tier unlock, one to use the skill on that class and one to use it on any class. The second requires defeating enemies while that skill is on your toolbar (you don't even have to use the skill). However if you level up too fast then the game won't let you unlock the skill trough gameplay, you have to use items and XP and the items (various Awake upgrades) are somewhat random drops. So it makes sense to level up slowly, once you unlock a new class, grind out the skills in the Depths (smaller maps unrelated to the main story) and then continue. When you die then you lose the XP (items and gear luckily remains). XP can be regained if you do a successful corpse run. You might get unlucky and die again before reaching where you died the first time tho. But this is no reason to rage quit at that point. The XP you get grows exponentially over the course of the game. So it might have taken hours to get 100k XP at the beginning of game but at the end of the game it's like 6 enemies within 1 minute of gameplay. So even losing million XP is not that big of a deal (happened to me a couple of times), you will get tons more.Overall I liked this game, I hope there will be a sequel.			"

Recommended,59.9,"																Code Vein is an excellent game that provides an exciting and unique take on the Souls-like genre. One of the standout features of Code Vein is its character customization system. You can choose from a vast selection of abilities, weapons, and character classes to create a unique character that suits your playstyle. The game's combat is fast-paced and challenging, with a variety of enemy types that require different strategies to defeat. The game features a 2-player co-op mode that allows you to play with your friends. However, you can only invite another player to help when the boss of the map has not been defeated. One thing worth noting is that if a player dies, the guest will have to reconnect with the host, which can be a bit of a hassle.I bought this game when it was 80% off, it's such a steal for a game like this.P.S.

Recommended,28.5,"																True to the Dark Souls formula with an Anime aesthetic to it. Slightly easier since you have a partner through the entire game that can take aggro when you need to flee. The game is of course, pretty challenging and definitely throws some cheap ways to kill you.The story was pretty decent and teh game offers 3 different endings. The environments are really detailed as well as teh character and enemy designs. The boss designs are really cool looking too. Levels are mostly linear but can get confusing since the devs designed them like a maze that get you to circle back alot. They do feel rather large since most areas transition into each other without a loading screen. Like FromSoft games, the weapons and armors all have unique designs and compliment the characters really well. CodeVein has it's own style though and with your partner, you can obtain special skills from other partners to use in combat.There were some minor micro stutters here and there but nothing too drastic and I never experienced a stutter during an actual fight. There are a few clipping visuals in early cutscenes with armors and hair, but is just more of a nitpick really. Running also feels sluggish and almost similar to Monster Hunter in a way, I was usually dodge rolling everywhere I could since it was faster.Out of all the level designs, The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is probably one of the worst designs i've ever played in a Souls game, let alone any game. The sheer size of it mixed with the massive back tracking, specific keys, hidden pathways, death around every ledge and corner, and teh massive maze like structure, made this specific part of the game a true test of patience. At times I got lost, and other times I found myself falling off ledges and floor holes. Compared to the other levels of teh game, this part took me a better part of 4hrs to do specifically because of how lost I got.Overall a fun souls game. It's different, but enjoyable, with cool designs and decent story.			"
Recommended,363.2,"																Look, I'm gonna be real here: are most of the reviews correct that say this game has some big tiddies and the Cathedral kinda sucks?  Absolutely.  Play it anyway.  Code Vein was rewarding, the right amount of challenging and the multiple build options for your character (with the ability to change them up at any time!) mean you always have an option to fit your playstyle or you can just change it up if things aren't working.  The story features some excellent moments, though your mileage may vary there.  The more ""anime"" moments thankfully didn't feel too over-the-top here.  Visually, CV has some gorgeous areas, effects and direction.  Is it flawless?  God, no.  There's model clipping, some dull spots and a handful of ""how do I deal with this"" moments in the gameplay, including some late-game areas that were a bit of a chore to navigate (looking at you, burning city), but I wouldn't trade my experience for anything.  I'm not a ""beat my head against the wall"" hard game fanatic, but CV had just the right amount of everything I wanted from a game like this without feeling unbeatable or too easy.  If you're on the fence, pick it up, on sale or not.  I don't regret any of the 60+ hours I spent with it and I'm even working on a LVL1 Challenge Run because I enjoyed it that much and because learning the game makes that feel surprisingly doable.  If there's ever a Code Vein 2, trust that will be a day 1 purchase.			"

Recommended,46.5,"																Definitely a solid souls-like with great combat and a variety of builds and classes available.The best thing about this game is that you can hot-swap between blood-codes (perk decks) which make up the bulk of your build. So you can switch builds/classes whenever you want. This is a ton of fun because you can make custom builds for different bosses and there is a TON of variety.That leads me to the one HUGE problem with this game which prevented me from playing any NG+. The more you level your character, the less XP you get to rank up your blood-codes (perk decks). This is a huge nerf, because when you max rank a perk deck then you can use the perks in other decks, which is where making all the fun builds comes in.If you level up your character enough, it becomes insanely grindy to level up cloud codes, which are at the core of making builds.So if you play this game, don't level up your character very much because the benefits are so small in comparison to what you get for mixing blood codes.

Recommended,258.2,"																I really enjoyed this game despite the anime vibe.(I know many people have been put off by it). It's not my thing but the combat was fast, smooth and there are some really cool weapons. I played it solo and blind first play through as a souls veteran, and oh boy it is challenging. You can tell it is made for co-op/your little helper. Especially the ""O&S"" of this game. monkaS. Worst ever. You still get that rewarding feeling when you beat them though.I will still recommend this game, but I have one MAJOR gripe and that is the achievements. Like many I presume I have 1 left. ""Exalted Reputation -Raise your reputation as a companion to rank 30"" This is garbage to try and achieve even in the games height when it was released. (Yes my review is very late). Even if you try to grind the offline way of getting it, it is too much. And oh yes I and another player did grind for it. Still too much and didn't get it. I have 100% in all Soulsborne, many other games. This one is still too much! LOL.			"
Recommended,12.3,"																First of all, I must give a shout-out to Elden Ring, as without it (my first souls-like) I wouldn't have enough skill or patience to play this. For Code Vein, now I'm done with my first playthrough, and about to head into NG+ for another ending and I'm loving it.I wish other souls-like would be more like this story-wise. Yes, our character is speaking only through written lines, but here it feels like he/she is truly relevant and part of the story, not some random someone. What's more, mixing the slow unveiling of the world through cut-scenes and dialog and still adding some details in equipment descriptions works much better for discovering the world imo. Add to it the ""Vestige"" system and the music coming with it... Awesome.The game certainly could've been longer if it's about the story itself, but I'm not regretting farming the ""Depths"" (repeatable side dungeons), as maxing out gift (skills/abilities/spells) proficiencies and experimenting with different builds was fun in itself.The Blood Code, or rather class system is innovative, though I can understand that some players may be annoyed by the prospect of ""farming"" proficiency, especially with something unfitting their playstyle...The world we can see in-game is... It's not anything that new, but it certainly is able to add to the atmosphere and remind us of the situation we're in. Although, I must critique few indoor/man-made levels as they're little too confusing to move through...Now, onto the DLCs, for which I feel very conflicted. I got them while the game was available with Season Pass and at a discount... And I wouldn't pay full price for them. Each DLC is a Depths/Dungeon area with 2 mini bosses (reskins), 1 new boss... and with difficulty automatically turned to NG+ level even if you play for the first time. Despite the description, the only new ""story"" is 1 vestige memory per DLC for ONE class. (Yes, you need all 3 DLCs to get through short side-story divided into 3 parts...)As for the bosses themselves... Annoying, though mainly due to health pools being over 100k each, but certainly doable. The achievement system for them is somewhat rewarding and satisfying... But most importantly, some of the abilities of new Blood codes/classes they bring are insanely powerful.All in all... Yes, I certainly would recommed playing this, though mainly because of the story and anime-style. For those unfamiliar with souls-like games... It's not as difficult after all, but difficulty spikes every now and then can easily discourage some people.			"

Recommended,74.8,"																I enjoyed it. It's hard to compare it to the game I had finished just before, Dark Souls 3, which has been the best in the genre by far to me. But on its own, Code Vein was a solid entry in this style of game. Easier by far than Dark Souls games if you keep the NPC AI partners with you, which is how I played it. I had a good time with it though and found the story, while pretty standard anime stuff, solidly delivered with quality cutscenes and good voice acting.Would certainly play a sequel if one were ever to come out. I only dabbled in the DLC. It wasn't interesting to me and had no story element to it, so I didn't really play it all.			"

It's dark souls with anime vampires.It does have some bugs that rank from annoying to potentially life-threatening, examples of those both extremes are some relationship items being deleted when changing menus for the former and the game not recognising mouse input at random during fights for the later.Beyond that, backstabbing is really satisfying, the fights are entertainingly challenging, the environment is beautiful and the soundtrack is great.

Recommended,8.1,"																Is this a good game?A clone of DS, whose developers have not fully thought out the nuances of the combat system. Because of this, those brave men who dare to launch this game suffer greatly.Pros for me:Great weapon and armor design. The partners are memorable, some are especially fanservice.Crafting weapons and armor is easier than in DS, there is almost no grind. At least I had enough resources to craft everything I need to kill bosses.Then there will be cons:The plot is more for show. The theme of the city in ruins has not been revealed, the feeling that you are walking through a labyrinth in urban scenery, nothing more. There are few monsters, and they do not shine with special originality. Except for the bosses, of course, which are mostly taken from DS.Features of the game:The trick of Code Vein is skill assemblies. Most of the game you just open them, then you try to do a targeted build. At the same time, there are no super strong skills - they all insignificantly affect a particular stat, while the number of slots is limited. And the number of buttons on the joystick too. In addition, special mana is required to use skills, so you won't be able to spam them. Yes, the enemies do not give, as a rule. However, it makes sense to build assemblies for a certain damage / resistance, although without a guide it is not so easy to do this.The second and more negative point for me is how the developers reworked the standard Dark Souls combat system. If in DS heavy weapons or long weapons meant slow strikes and long pauses between strikes, then in Code Vein this formula only works in relation to the player. Monsters and especially bosses all have 2-5 meter weapons, which they swing without stopping. They almost never hit 1 hit, as a rule, there is always a bunch of 2-4 hits, if the hit touches the player, it interrupts the attack animation or even knocks him down. The player's blows never knock monsters down, and their animation can be interrupted only if you are very lucky.As a result, the boss fight is a constant blocking and rolling, in the hope of finding a window to deliver one or two hits. Mistakes are punishable by death. By the way, the rolls have completely migrated from DS, they also consume stamina. But because of the increased radius of attack of enemies, one roll is usually not enough. It is necessary to do two rolls to the side in order to dodge. Then run to the enemy, and during this time he manages to start the animation of the next attack, which must also be dodged. The only reliable option is to roll behind the enemy's back.There is also a small bonus - in this game we run with a partner. Some partners, alone, are capable of holding a whole bunch of mobs on themselves and inflicting serious damage on them. With bosses, their help is generally invaluable. If there were no partners, it would be almost impossible to pass some bosses.In the end - if you have not completed all DS - go through them first. If you have passed and want new challenges - you may like this game. In my opinion, it has enough minuses, but the pluses balance them. Ultimately, it gives pleasure.			"

Recommended,93,"																Check out my curator page for more awesome reviews TL;DRFrom the makers of God Eater: A decent enough souls-like that does not many new things, but more often succeeds with the new ideas, but also fails to deliver on the fundamentals.If you really need your souls-like infusion and do not mind anime, Code Vein can be a decent experience.The Souls-Like ExperienceAt this point, everyone knows the Souls formula:The player has limited healing and needs to conquer areas, from checkpoint to checkpoint, finally reaching a boss that claps the player.Not only scarring physically but also mentally. After a cycle of repeatedly dying and getting good, the player succeeds and repeats these actions in the following area.There is nothing wrong with a simplistic loop, but it is the execution that is relevant. The Design of Code VeinCode Vein is a lot more conventional in terms of storytelling and lore implications than Dark Souls. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but it suffers from the usual anime tropes: overbearing dialogue, lack of subtle changes, and oversexualized designs. Especially the last one overstays its welcome:There is a definitive horniness to everything. Especially the chest area of female characters has been hit with the enlarge button and jiggle physics. These prove that in the Code Vein-universe five fundamental forces exist.If you like these visual aspects (or at least they do not bother you), Code Vein looks alright: Most areas use the same assets repeatedly, but every place has a relatively distinctive identity. Traversing anything in Code Vein is boring because of that. Nothing catches the eye. At least the music is pretty good and keeps the spirits up while mostly nothing happens.There is an argument to be made that the characters are somewhat of a saving grace. While their arcs are not unique, some of their stories were gracefully subverted. It is just a slog to get the whole picture because the presentation of any character's past is too slow.At least they are very distinctive in their designs which is one of the strong suits. Argue with modern anime design all you want, often modern anime characters are visually extremely memorable.Last but not least: I have to applaud the character creator. It is indeed the true final boss of any player. This makes Fashion Vain a viable option and maybe generates 20% of the player's interest. Level DesignCode Vein is conventional in its level design. While a linear approach works, CV does not utilize strengths and adds to this the unpopular Dark Souls 2 popularized idea of spamming enemies against you in ambushes.Code Vein Does not support this approach with varied enemies. They feel and are similar in design, killing the variation in the process. As a result: encounters are just pretty bland. None of them create memorable scenarios that require brainpower to solve. I consider most areas filler to test your tools.Some levels even become obnoxious and are frustrating mazes that are long stretches of the same corridor.The ToolsThe weapon sandbox of Code Vein is impressive as there are three things to consider:Multiple blood codes exist that contain abilities that can be mastered and then used with other blood codes. Blood codes decide the stats of the protagonist because the player does not level individual stats. That means the player can use any build at any time, just by switching the blood code.The equipment decides the style of the actual gameplay. There is not much to say here. It is remarkable in one aspect: Armor is relevant for the drain, parry, and backstep animations.  The equipment provides perfect synergies with particular blood cores. Complete freedom does not exist but testing out what works is fun while it lasts. Code Vein generates the most fun when it lets the player run wild, but this fun gets blocked by longwinded and arduous unlocking of skills which takes the momentum out of the game.The other problem is that Code Vein lacks the polish of the Souls series in terms of sound design and the feel of weapons. There is no real impact to any action which cheapens that effect and personal satisfaction. ConclusionCode Vein often stops itself from becoming a great experience by sabotaging its own strengths while lacking polish around the Souls-basics. If there ever is a Code Vein 2, I hope that the responsible studio learned from their mistakes. If that happens, Code Vein 2 could become a great game.Originally posted by author:As of now, meme curators dominate Steam.

Recommended,50.1,"																While the game is brutal and sometimes very difficult, the story it tells isn't. Underneath the hard bosses and the maze like levels is a game that tells of a beautiful story of friendship, sacrifice and a commitment to do good. If you're coming into this game expecting some dark setting like dark souls where everything is depressing or some crazy story telling like Nier Automata, then Code Vein isn't that game. What Code Vein does is consistency in its narration and rewards you for sticking with it. Yes the world is in the apocalypse, but it doesn't have to always be the case. This is what I believe its main theme is, and it does this really well. The characters knows how bad they have it, yet are mature enough to realize that its not as bleak as everyone else thinks. And I like that.Gameplay wise, I have no comments. I can't judge how faithful its difficulty is to Dark Souls level difficulty, but its enough for me. I like how we can have multiple powers and cool ways to devour enemies. Although I did note that bosses sometimes cheat on me when they can hit me when I'm sure that it wouldn't have been possible, it could just be me, and the games generous enough to provide you a companion to fight alongside with.Music is great, but there are a lot of vocals especially during cut-scenes.Would I recommend it? 50/50. You have to know what you're getting into. After playing so many Tales games and other Bandai Namco games, I kind of can tell the kind of games I expect from them. If you know you don't like games that talks about the power of friendship and where everyone can be matured enough to deal with the problems at hand and not go all dramatic, then you might wanna skip this one.But all in all I'm glad Bandai Namco can keep up with their consistency win making games that I enjoy			"
Recommended,111.8,"																  One of the best souls-like games i've ever played.   Code Vein's leveling progression system resembles a lot Dragon's Dogma, where you have different classes with different atributes and skills, but they can be changed at any time, and once you level up the skills in a class, you unlock it to all other classes. This makes it extremelly flexible and configurable, as you can combine multiple skills from diferent classes in a single one to make it more unique.  The combat mechanics though, are a bit more complex, but a lot less polished than the Souls Series, that including player attacks, dodges, enemy attacks, environment and so on.   The exploration is very satisfying and feels balanced, to a point where you don't require a guide to get all items, if you just dedicate a bit more time to explore every path.  The design of the game in general, is ok. The anime-like aesthetics were well implemented, and they made most of the characters very pleasing and unique. As for the enemies, they feel a bit dull, and later on, they become repetitive. The bosses also feel a bit uninspired, compared to the Souls Series, but overall, they're ok. Of course, there are exceptions, some enemies are really cool, and some bosses (like the first successor) are nice.   The map design is good, most of them are just destroyed parts of the city or some type of cavern, but it's very pleasing to look, and are good to explore. One map worth mentioning here is the Cathedral, wich is the Anor Londo of Code Vein. Astonishing design, enemies and lots of traps and ambushes, but 9 times out of 10 you're lost not knowing where to go.  To wrap this up, the general flow and balance of the game i think are it's main flaws. On the beggining, everything seems perfect, then you reach the first ""real boss"" of the game, wich is extremelly hard for a first timer, and it feels great. But from that point on, you power creep very hard. The game features a companion mechanic, wich is someone from your main base wich you can ask to acompany you in your journey. They are really cool, awesome design, unique abilities, they make comments on the landscape and the situations you go through as you explore. But they are very overpowered. Each in their own department (there is a guy that tanks a lot, another one wich deals TONS of damage, a balanced, one that buffs you, etc), you have the option of going alone, but once you are familiarized with the systems it's a breeze even without them.  It's combat is more fast-paced, so you take a lot of damage but also deal a lot of damage, once you start building your character to deal imense amounts of damage, you kill almost eveything in 1-2 hits, and boss battles last for mere seconds.  Overall, even with it's flaws, the game is very fun, has a lot of content for a first playthrough (wich i haven't finished yet), also has tons of replayability with multiple endings and new classes for NG+. I consider it a very solid 7/10.			"

Recommended,52.9,"																Let me start by saying that the world of Code Vein is very interesting and I sincerely hope the devs are on their way in making a second one which expands the world and lore around it!With that out of the way lets talk about something that probably everyone wants to know about this game, is the story good? I'd say its interesting, albeit a bit dull due to the fact that your character mostly stays as the silent protag. Due to this, the story and world is explained and shown to you through your companions which thankfully are an interesting bunch! most if not all of them have tragic stories to tell and if you are diligent enough in finding their lost memories the end result is quite sweet for some of their stories and with that you learn more about the world and its inhabitants. For a player like myself who does enjoy collecting and looking for these sort of things its really not that big of a problem, however I can see how some people might just forget about restoring the memories and just rushing straight for that ending to get it over with.The gameplay is very fun, you can change your blood code at any given time to best suit the situation hence making every boss fight different as you trial and error your way into finding the right tools for the right job. Of course, you  can play as I did and just brute force your way through with the Broadswords however i did find myself changing the type of buffs and armors. Its fairly challenging and I have found myself in several situations where it was pretty clutch where it was either me or the boss who was gonna die! Pretty intense stuff!Character creation is great, you can make some really nice anime protagonists, however i found the clothes option to be somewhat lacking as well as the photo mode being very basic. (like you cant even pose with your NPCS) Graphics look good. Overall, I quite enjoyed playing Code Vein and I really hope there's a second one coming! with expanded customizations, maybe some dialogue options too and a better photo mode! Get it on sale for maximum value, its not for everyone...however its definitely worth a try as well			"
Recommended,18.5,"																UPDATE AFTER GAME COMPLETION :-I love the game, especially the mapping system. Just when I thought that today's games cannot be more creative, I was proven wrong. The mapping system is great. It shows the traces of footsteps in two sizes. The bigger one is for the most recent one, and the smaller one is the oldest.  Also, in NG+ and beyond, all the maps that were cleared, will stay clreared, and wont be reset. That means, for those willing to speedrun the game for different endings, it will be a lot easier. The story is way too depressing though.  . Apart from that, what I didnt like is the most common thing in any souls like game where bosses are considerably easy - the bosses are easy, but they can one shot.  I AM WAITING FOR A SEQUEL. HOPE THEY PLAN ON IT. The game is great. Not as good as Dark Souls for sure (in terms of gameplay), but great in its own way. I especially liked the anime style game. The bosses can be a bit challenging at times, but still easier than Souls. Also, you can have a partner to accompany you, and it is a great improvement as well. I dont like a lot of co-op , but having an AI based partner is great.But the most bada** about this game is the feelings.. the feelings about struggling to live, and the soundtrack accompanying this feeling,........ is way too overburden for me.

Recommended,106,"																It's Absolutely Dark Souls, but There's More to ItAs someone who's beaten Dark Souls 1+3 multiple times, I can say that this game has more in common with Dark Souls than not. So I'd like to highlight some key differences since this game does manage to carve out its own identity. Here's a few things it does that Dark Souls does not do:- The Blood Codes: this game uses an interesting mechanic in which you can re-spec your character on the fly. This makes it fun to try different play styles. Dark Souls locks you into their level-up system, so there's not much room to try new builds once you get going. This game is way more flexible. I found myself re-specing my character a lot depending on the situation. It's a great addition.- Multiplayer: Unlike Dark Souls, this game has multiplayer. I didn't use it much, but the game is designed for 2 players. They offer you a wide variety of NPC companions, each with their own abilities. So the game is essentially designed for co-op. This does make the game quite a bit easier than Dark Souls though. However, this also makes it less infuriating. People may have different opinions on this, but I enjoyed it.- A Story: Unlike Dark Souls, this game actually has a story with cutscenes and exposition. It's not very compelling, and it's pretty confusing at times. But the ""memories"" you unlock add significant backstory to the characters and at least there's a narrative to drive things along. It needs work, but hey, it's there.Overall: Although the game's mechanics feel identical to Dark Souls, it does manage to have its own identity. It's easier, the level design definitely isn't as good (although there are some pretty neat areas), it has a story, it has multiplayer, it has a flexible level-up system, and it doesn't out-stay its welcome. It scratches the itch if you're wanting more Dark Souls. I'd give it 8/10.			"

Recommended,89.4,"																Overall I could maybe recommend this game. But to be honest, is hard to overlook all the bad soaked to the bones (and the ""season pass"" scam).First, art design is bad. Models are overly simplistic, weapons are weird in general (thick, overly flourished - not in a good way, more like in a ""5yo drawing"" way), movement is clunky (they f***ed up even the dodge-roll), general weapon animations are repetitive and not engaging (or unique) enough to create a good diversity. Level design is one of the worst I saw to this date in a souls-like... If every single ladder had a unique model with his own texture (instead of coping/paste the same 731 times) this game would probably be over 300GB in size. Seriously... The ""loading corridors"" plus the ""biome-like"" areas are just weird. The whole world is just a bizarre patchwork, and not in a good way - is such level of bad that will make you change your DS2 ratings from ""meh, not the best"" to ""masterpiece - game of the century"" in a hearth beat.The ""blood codes"" are a good idea, and also the vessels storing memories alloying you to have a glimpse of the past. But is so poorly executed... the loop is like:(1) Io sleeping (always); (2) click and wait the b**** to get up; (3) click restore vestige - LOADING; (4) walk stupidly slow for two or three minutes (sometimes to just hear a single f***ing line of dialogue); (5) reach the gate - very slowly; (6) LOADING; (7) Brief conversation. Now repeat this 50-60 times... Brain damage unlocked.You get where I'm going. Every aspect is half-assed, nothing above average. Even the waifu/customization aspect is overrated (and extremely limited). Bad engine (not optimal for this game), bad writing, bad presentation, bad design(s).

Recommended,46.2,"																Would recommend, but only if it's on sale. It's a decent anime-styled Soulslike. The highs: Fast-paced impactful combat.In-depth character builds which really open up towards the end. You can be a speedy fencer, a sturdy tank, a mage that shoots giant lasers, or a lancer.Lows: The awful, mazelike Cathedral area which goes on far too long. Honestly I'd be on a New Game+ run if not for the idea that I'd have to go through that crap again. The game in general, particularly the bosses, needed a few more balance passes. Invading Executioner particularly is extremely difficult for the point of the game when you fight her, with a poorly telegraphed slide attack that does way more damage than her others. As the game progresses, bosses require you to run high-damage ""Glass Cannon"" builds more and more. I found myself trying to fight certain later bosses ""honestly"" and struggling. So what you do instead is pre-buff before the fight to the point where you can just run out and kill them in 3 hits.			"

Recommended,490.7,"																My first souls like game, since I finished it and immediately wanted to try Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I'd say it's a good intro into the genre. The gameplay is flexible, allowing for quick switching between dozens of different classes and abilities, this plus three different endings based on choices you make give it good replayability too. Art design and overall graphics are very impressive and creative, giving it a recognisable identity, and the music is great with multiple memorable tracks. The many bosses are creative and challenging, but not so much that you feel the need to smash your keyboard, creating fun fights that feel accomplishing to beat. Main complaints go out to some very cringeworthy writing and some rare instances of horrible level design (Screw the Cathedral of Blood). Also, catgirl enemies. Rating: 7/10			"

Recommended,32.7,"																Honestly one of my favorite games, not as hard as the other souls-like games, but enjoyable for a person who haven't played a souls-like before, and the story is good. Character creation is also a bit funky and allows for both really weird funky characters and the more edgy ones, for those that wants that. Overall a pleasant experience.			"
Recommended,57.6,"																This is my first time ever playing a Dark Souls-styled game, and I can't believe how much fun I've had so far, despite only playing for a few hours. The combat was really difficult at first, as learning to time my parry and dodges took some getting used to, along with learning how certain enemies attack, but as I died time and time again, I found myself learning how out manuever heavy attacks and watch for openings. It was also interesting with having to conserve my healing items and plan ahead for fights, which is something that a lot of other games don't really push that much. The story also does a great job at building an interesting world to explore, and does a good job at explaining all the ins and outs without overwhelming you or making things seem overcomplicated.I'd say that the only gripe that I have with the game is how some large enemies are able to attack you through walls, which can really suck when you're trying to get a quick heal in.			"
Recommended,29.9,"																This game features combat which that is like Dark Souls combat, but with a stronger focus on combat styles. The combat styles feel very unique, and they are the most important part of the gameplay. This means that there is more to the game than simply just levelling up. I am yet to complete the game, but so far the story is very good, and reminds me of Nier: Automata. The sound track is also nice to hear, and i enjoy listening to it. I also like the anime aesthetic of the game too, it looks very pleasing without looking overly cartoonish, and it matches the style of the game very well. On a less important note, the game does also feature probably one of the best character creators among other games like it, so if you like customisation, that's another thing to look forwards to.Overall, if you like Dark Souls combat, Nier: Automata and Anime, then i can say confidently that you will fall in love with this game just as i have, and thus i highly recommend this game to you.

Recommended,11.2,"																This is a really solid action game; the mechanics all work together perfectly.By using melee attacks or blocking hits, you build up points that you can use for buffs or ranged attacks called ""gifts."" This creates a fantastic in-and-out rhythm to every combat situation where you have to strategically hang back or close in for the kill. The game encourages you to have an AI or human-controlled partner with you, which splits enemy aggro between you and your partner and allows you moments to use gifts or heal.Levelling is a single number that increases your stats across the board; your ""build"" can be swapped on the fly by switching out your ""blood code,"" which changes how each of your stats scale and grants you access to exclusive gifts. New players have plenty of options to try out many offensive and defensive playstyles without being punished for experimentation, while veterans can quickly learn how to strategically hit each area to maximize their planned build.There's not as much variety on offer here compared to the Souls games (especially the first two), but what you get instead is a focused action experience that gives you the freedom to be challenged, experiment, iterate, and succeed.Also waifus or something.

Recommended,85.5,"																The game was very good, with a clear gameplay and quite intuitive keyboard layout, even tho I had to change Guard (block attacks) to lateral mouse button, which was at left Alt instead. The game is very deep in lore and interesting, and if you know someone else who played it you can keep quite a time speaking about it and making out stories or hypothesis. There's one big problem tho, I had bought this game for 2 persons, as well as for me, we were all interested in the game but we also really wanted to play together, as it looked like a real fun souls-like but with co-op! For some reason, the game doesn't let me connect to no one in the world at all, even tho I followed all sorts of tips and helps for people that already had this issue and didn't work at all. I did contact customer support twice, and very kind people replied to my e-mail within a couple of days and started trying to help me out. Shame was there was no solution to my problem at all, or so they thought.The solution was to use a bridge program to connect a direct tunnel between computers, with an application for example called ""Hamachi"" that allows two computers to connect. That way, and if both have strong connection, you are allowed to play together with another person.The other issue was the design of the multiplayer itself. You send a distress signal, and tell your buddy to search for a stress signal set with the same password he has set, and within the same network options set. After a roughly 15 seconds, the system finds the distress signal, loading screen, and join my game. Great, we're together, and we can play.When you're with another player, you can't access mistles, the checkpoints. You can't manage your storage, level up, or even rest if there's another player in the game. To do so, the other player would have to leave (another loading screen) and then join after you've done your business (yet another loading screen). You can still active new Mistles nonetheless. Also, if your buddy dies while fighting, he will be disconnected from the game. 2 more loading screens for him to join again. And, if I die, the one hosting, he's kicked from the game, and has to do the whole process again. Also, there are some areas where you can't send a distress signal, like while fighting or in a final boss area. Sometimes, randomly, the game doesn't let you send a distress signal, apparently for no reason at all, but lets you after a good while (last time, 45 mns).Overall the game is very great, very inmersive and fun to play, but if you're planning to buy it just to play with someone else, think twice about it. If you do anyways buy it and try and have trouble, asking customer support is a good idea.			"
Recommended,70.2,"																Soulsborne-like with big anime tiddies including a great character creator. If you're going to compare this game to a Soulsborne game in its entirety, you're gonna have a bad time. Environment/Graphics: Accurately hits the anime stylings it's going for. New areas are cool but the looks start  to get repetitive. Enemy designs are pretty cool. Character design in general is great, did I mention anime tiddies?Cinematics: Basically pulled out of any modern anime-adapted JRPG style, drag on a bit long and are overly dramatic for no apparent reason. Wonderful fantasy and escapism at its finest.Combat: Kinda like if Nier Automata and Soulsborne games had a baby.Skill System: Confusing and different but once you figure out what's going on you'll spend some time planning your character out and stop playing the game entirely, get distracted on Reddit or Twitter or something, realize minmaxing in the big tiddie anime girl souls game isn't worth it and then go back to killing baddies and cheesing bosses.There's a really cool dungeon system similar to Bloodborne (kinda). I don't have a ton of hours yet so I haven't done everything, but it seems good.Overall game is much good and very fun. Recommended!			"

Being an anime fan, the animations, characters make the whole experience very satisfying.It has quite a sad story that I would've liked to continue with the DLC's, but they were just extra areas, where you fight more mobs and bosses. Can't complain though, because you get cool new outfits for your in-game waifus/husbandos, if that's your jam.P.S. The character creation menu here is a blessing.			"

"
Recommended,30.4,"																This game has one of the best character creator and customization features I've come across. It's downright impressive. And the memory traversal mechanic is quite unconventional.Apart from those, everything else is okay but not great. Premise was interesting, but story and script writing not so much. World-design could have been better. A lot of the environments are quite generic, though there are a couple of pretty cool areas. Level-design and traversal can range from well thought out to boring to plain lazy.Characters are well designed and most cutscenes are well-animated. However, the characters themselves are quite one-dimensional and most of them have so-so backstories. You'll may find yourself rolling your eyes when traversing some of their memories.Hands down, the worst thing with this game is there is a complete lack of attention to detail when it comes to combat design: - Enemy attacks with flashy animations and long dramatic wind ups can eat just a fifth of your life bar while out of the blue attacks with split second wind ups can take off three quarters. - Sometimes, it's impossible to dodge an attack from Enemy B right after executing a backstab on Enemy A (not enough i-frames). - Bosses can be attacking your companion one second, then all of a sudden turn and turbo dash at you in one motion with barely a visual cue. - Healing takes forever, and some bosses do not have enough moves that give you enough time to heal in between. And their attacks seem unconditionally randomized, meaning they can do the same fast attacks over and over again, forcing you to keep dodging and leaving you no chance to heal, almost like boss fights boil down to luck way too often. - The true final boss (which you will have to defeat at least 3 times to 100% the game) was a complete s***show that does not suit the battle mechanics at all.Overall, I can see what the developers were trying to achieve, as they managed to lay out enough of the pieces that I can visualize what this game could have been. Is it a terrible game? No, it's actually quite enjoyable for the most part. Just don't play through Sekiro (or something as equally magnificent) right before picking this up like I did. If you're considering Code Vein, just temper your expectations, and make sure to milk the game's character creator for all it's worth.----------------------------------------------------OVERALL SCORE: 38 out of 62 (so roughly 61.3%)----------------------------------------------------			"
Recommended,74.1,"																Closest souls-like to the original in terms of combat. Make sure you watch a video on how blood codes, blood veils, and visages work. Really confusing at first. Pretty solid game tho. Amazing character creator. I didn't care much for the story but that's probably because I'm not huge on anime. DLC's suck tho avoid those at all costs. It's ""meant"" for co-op, but honestly it turns into a backstab fest if you do. Still an amazing game. Just make the backstabs and parries harder, they're way too easy to abuse. If you likes souls games I guarantee you'll like this			"

Recommended,19.1,"																Incredibly fun game, lots of game to play, including New Game+ - Soundtrack is overall very good, story is reasonable but feels lacking with awful character interaction timing/poor animation/poor voice acting at times; but you can struggle to find which one is lacking the most from time to time. But beyond these flaws there is a game with incredible customisation, from looks to your entire combat loadout and skills, with some amazing features in how it approaches being a souls-like game, with it's own personality, and a world that feels more real than you could expect if you let it take you there.The devs have listened to players and their issues, making small adjustments to make the game more bearable with things like muting your partner to stop them repeating the same lines over and over, and adding more here and there for players to experience and continue to enjoy the game beyond the story.

Recommended,9.9,"																Great soulslike, with engaging story and lot of stuff to discover.I like the idea of changing your playstyle on the fly though it has some disadvantages(like, its kinda harder to munch thru all the different stats to refine different builds, also it would be great to have the ability to assign items to current class).Over all if you like dark souls and can survive ""anime""graphics. Get into it. you will not regret it and you shall enjoy one hell of a story and game .			"
Recommended,89.1,"																So I just went through Juzo Mido and nearing the end of the game. Anime Souls is fun! I didn't expect myself enjoying it as much as I am - on one hand I enjoy them soulslike, on another I am rather meh on the whole anime shtick, but my hunger four souls won over. And I was pleasantly surprised. The game combat is quite robust, fluid and still has this trademark resource management, even more so than in traditional souls as on top of Stamina you have to gain and manage your Ichor to unleash your special abilities, buffs and superior attacks. You can actually play a ranged class and it won't suck, so that's also nice. The whole customization of your character and the builds is very extensive, intuitive and most importantly - not prohibitive, that is you can switch between roles pretty much as you please to try out a new thing. That's excellent!The game difficulty is also handled very well - the intended way clealry is to go with a partner, and while the AI-companion is a little dumb, they still help a lot by getting aggro off you, landing some hits and giving you a revive when you fall. This means that if you roll with the companion whole game, it is significantly easier than most soulslike when maintaining the genre combat flow and image. However that's great, because all you have to do to get a proper souls gameplay is to simply not have a companion! Going solo raises the game difficulty quite a bit, as well as it must - no more freebies on revives, all aggro is yours and you cant use quite potent companion skills. So without having an actual difficulty choice, you can still tailor the game to suits your needs.Story-wise so far it's pretty entertaining - not the lofty work of art, not deep lore, a bit of a classic anime shtick filled with oppai, but it's a pleasant go through all-in-all. The good thing is that just like in other soulslike proper you kinda decide how deeply invested you want to be with it. You can go into all the vestiges, figure out the memories of all your buddies, save all the baddies etc... Or you can flip em off and just focus on pushing through the level to another one to just enjoy the smashing through the walls. It's up to you.So, for me, it's a very proper soulslike with enough new and fun gimmicks to be fresh and enjoyable! Blood Codes (classes) are plentiful and fun, the weapons feel good and the gifts are giving quite a flare to combat, whichever type you enjoy. Bah! They even got their own 'Blighttown' in form of the cursed Cathedral, where everyone gets lost and sick of it. Proper.			"

Though it does feel like its repeating itself a lot of the time with droning sounds/enemies, and its difficulty isn't as high as Dark Souls (for me at least), it caters to the player experience to be a lot funner and safer, so it feels a lot more fair when you get an axe through you're squishy anime face.			"
Recommended,49.5,"																Code Vein is a worthy Souls-like game consisting of solid gameplay, an interesting world, compelling narrative and amazing soundtrack. If you`re in doubt about buying it, I`d say do it, I thought it was a blast.Now, details.Being a Souls-like, Code Vein`s gameplay primarily focuses in combat and exploration. You have light and heavy attacks, block, parry and dodge commands, as well as active and passive equippable skills in which you can use four passives and eight active ones. It also has classes, but you can swap between them anytime, so you can experiment freely. Thought that means you don`t distribute attribute points yourself, you just level up and get stronger, while the point distribution will be handled by the class you are currently equipped with. Said distribution will change if you swap classes, so there really is nothing locking you to a single class in this game. There are only a few types of weapons, though I didn't feel like there was something missing. The game makes do with the weapon types it has, with some unique weapons having unique movesets as well. You can also equip armor, but it's only one slot. So if you're expecting Dark Souls level of armor mixing and matching you'll be disappointed. Though again, I don't think the game needs that type of complexity. It works the way it is.Okay, so I`ve told you more or less how your character is set up for combat, but what about the action itself?Well, it's good. It's more slow paced like Dark Souls, instead of say, Sekiro. While the hit-boxes are fine for most attacks, I felt that there were some in which they were a bit off. Enemy and Boss AI are not completely stupid, but you can exploit them if you get their patterns. You can dash or dodge/fat-roll depending on the weight you're carrying and how much your class can handle. I thought the map design was nice visually, but a bit lackluster gameplay-wise, and sometimes kind of hinders the actual combat. Also, there is co-op similar to Dark Souls, in which you help a friend in a segment, then are kicked out of their world after helping them defeat a boss. Though in this game you don't have to use items or anything of the sort to play multiplayer, so that's good.The story itself's quality can be pretty subjective, like the game's art style, but I particularly liked both, and won't say much more to avoid spoiling anything. Just don't expect a Dark-Souls kind of approach to the story. This game gives you context of what is happening via cutscenes and dialogue, which I don't find bad, but some people like a more subtle approach.The soundtrack is really good. There are action, dramatic, atmospheric, relaxing and emotional pieces, and it complements the game well. There are many memorable songs, and I find some stuck in my head even when I'm not playing the game.All in all, I really liked this game, and think it's absolutely worth it even at full price. It's a great addition to the Souls-like sub-genre, and I hope those who buy it enjoy it as much as I did.If I had to rate it, I would give it an 8/10. 			"

Recommended,80.9,"																Highly recommend this game, even if you aren't Souls series fan.First of all, i would like to tell, that i am in no way fan of punishing games like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Sekiro and alike (i consider myself too old for this ♥♥♥♥ lol). and honestly, if i bothered to check in advance if this game is Souls style gameplay wise i would probably have skipped it. and i am so glad that i didn'tI was captivated by a lot of things: character creation, character customization characters personalities, atmosphere of the world, lore, story. all these aspects are so good, it made me want to clear the game no matter the difficulty. yes, i shouted a lot while playing this game and cursing every time i died due to mistakes i made in battle. but in the end, i just couldn't give up, i took a firm stance that i want to see the ending (and the best ending at that), so i got better at the game and saw it through the end. and i'll probably play a new game+, despite the difficulty spike, this is how much i like the gameSo seriously, if you considered getting this game, but was scared by Souls like punishing gameplay, I still recommend you give it a shot. Just play with an AI companion (makes things much easier), or, if you have a friend - play together with a friend via online coop. It is worth noting, that i got better at the game and gone through all difficulty spikes without using any online guides (i had to die over 10 times at certain bosses, but oh well, i couldn't give up =) ), so this game is probably easiest out of all Souls like games. Still, if you hit an unbreakable wall, check out online guides for character builds and some general advise on how to utilize your combat abilities.			"

Recommended,44.4,"																Summary: After playing, suffering, enduring, and persevering, I finally completed this game and achieve the Dweller in the Dark ending in 43 hours. I did everything I could like side missions and unlocking certain achievements. This game is really like a lighter/more forgiving version of Dark Souls (I have never played it but know how difficult it is). The biggest draw to this game to me, other than my friend gifting this for an early birthday gift, was the character customization. When he said people took around an hour or two creating a character, he wasn't wrong. My first character was ""Prince of Wales"" from ""Azur Lane"" and I was able to mostly create a character I'm proud to call great. Character Customization:This was the convincing factor that made me buy this game. You have quite a lot of free real estate when it comes to customization. You can choose from a variety of hair styles a colours that you will have not problem finding the correct one for you. For character sizes, you can't really change much other than eye shape and head shape. There is changing size of breast for female characters but not sure what the equivalent is to the male character. The height is fixed as tall so you can't really make a short character. For clothing, you are somewhat limited to certain normal attire but you do have the options to change multiple colours of the outfit. Then there are accessories. You have countless accessories to choose included hair extensions to really create the perfect hair. Furthermore, you have the option to move around and change the size and rotation of the accessories to your liking (Some accessories abide by gravity, so check by changing poses during customization). For last, you have voices. You have around 15-20 voices to choose from which I really like since most games don't give you even a couple choices of voices. Overall, I really adore the customization and enjoyed creating a close replica of Prince of Wales from Azur Lane (See my screenshots of Code Vein to see).Characters/Voices Actors:I became really attached to many of the characters in this game. Even some minor characters like a Self-Important Revenant and the Human woman make them memorable. Some minor characters you find later after clearing out certain areas will give side quest you can do in order to gain some money and materials. The voice acting is great. They always feel appropriate and convey the mood of the story pretty well. Most characters are the same height, but their personality, backstory, clothing, and voices make them all distinct from each other.Combat:The combat is one of the main aspects of this game. For the weapons, you have some options (One & Two Handed Swords, Bayonets, Hammers, Spears, and Halberds). You can upgrade them and add buffs to them like 'venom' or 'fire'. You also have access to both active and passive skills called 'gifts' that you can unlock as you level up and play. Consumables are there as well to help increase you chance of winning and not die, unless you try to walk off a ledge thinking there is an invisible border (I literally died a lot to falling off due to enemies knockback, the map, and my own stupidity). There is armour called 'blood veils' that give boost to certain defences and gifts. Sadly, you can't customize veils and there is no option to override an active veil with a cosmetic veil.Map:The maps in this game was really well designed. They is a lot of hidden pathways and secondary pathways that the player can take. Verticality is very important in maps as it is often the best way to find hidden paths or items. This also allows to attack enemies from above which does more damage than usually. The creative design itself is amazing. The maps have different themes that make them visually and emotionally different from others. You have a desert map, an underground map, a snowy mountain map, a Tranzit (BO 2: Zombies Map) like map, a Cathedral map, and many many more.Coop/Multiplayer:In the beginning, I thought it was a 4-player coop but it is not. There is only 2-player. Moreover, if the host dies (not including being downed) (and also the other player), it instantly ends the session and you have to restarted it again. While it was frustrating, it is understandable. This game is really made for you to beat it yourself and this coop is just to assist other players who may be having trouble.Bosses:This game does create great bosses that makes you want to rip your hair out. The general rule is that you will most likely not defeat a boss first try (I did with the first boss and with the sand-level boss). You may even have to try multiple attempts until you even get closes (took 23 attempts on the spear-lady boss). If you are stubborn and determined, and maybe experienced with Dark Souls, you should be fine, but if you can't take boss like this, then maybe this game might not be for you. Moreover, you may have to find every time and upgrade on maps to even have a chance of defeating bosses (I collected everything in the maps and even then I had a hard time). You do have access to coop for help but even then you still will have problems beating the boss. You just needed to learn timing; the boss's attacks; changing blood codes, gifts, and tactics; and some luck to beat one. The bosses themselves are well designed, pretty cool, and they always change the boss in a way which may require you to change something. They are so well designed and animated that you feel like you actually accomplished something. Ending: (No Spoilers)There is three endings in this game. If you really want the best ending, then you will have to basically do and collect everything in order to achieve it. The ending I got was well made and literally brought tears to my eyes. The other two endings are the bad and neutral one, and I didn't want to replay the game in order to see it. If you want a certain ending, it may be advisable to look at guides or even just the requirements in order to get it. Once you mess up, you may not be able to go back (I was able to when I f*ck up and just alt + f4 in order to hopefully prevent it from saving), so be careful if you really care about the ending.Overall, this was one game in 2019 that I really loved, despite 2019 being really sh*t with games. I did as much as I could and now I have to wait for the upcoming DLC in 2020. If you really want a challenge or try a lighter/anime-style version of Dark Souls, then this game is for you.Pros: *Great Character Customization*Levelling and Skills*Good Voice Acting*Good Price*Multiple Endings*Well Designed and Creative Maps to Explore*Difficulty (For players who want a challenge and enjoy overcoming problems and frustration)Cons:*Limited Two Player Coop*Difficulty (Not for casual or uncontrollable-raging players) (Only slightly less and more forgiving than Dark Souls)			"

Recommended,8.4,"																I am writing this review at 96 hrs of play on record, and I must state that I LOVE the soulsborne genre of games.So let's start of with the positives, I absolutely love this game! There is a very small amount of things in this game that i do not like, everything else I love. Here are some bullet points:- Great customisation in the character creator.- Easy to grasp controls.- Beautiful environments.- Great weapon and armour designs.- Really cool back stab/parry/drain attacks.- Excellent build customisation with all of the different Blood Codes and Gifts, as well as mastering Gifts.- Good mix of A.I. companions at your side to choose from.- Awesome character design for the NPCs.- Very challenging boss fights and enemy mobs throughout the whole experience.- Fun online coop.- Fantastic and interesting narrative.And now for the negatives that i have:- Back stabbing seems to be a little weird when trying to land them on an enemy but when they do they work.- Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, my only issue with this area is it can be a pain to navigate sometimes.Overall my opinion is that this is an incredible game, my personal favourite this year and I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend this beautiful and fun game to anyone that enjoys these types of games and in all honesty, I've had more trouble with this game (when it comes to how challenging the difficulty can be (which is a positive)) than I have with some of the Souls games which is partially why I love it so much.I apologise for the short review but hope it helps out! ^^			"
Recommended,16,"																code vein is an anime action rpg with souls like elements.need i say more?In all seriousness though, i consider the game to be a solid pick when its on sale, some of the issues like the constant clipping(if you've seen anything from this game you know what i mean) and the difficult-ai makes it a little too easy usually and without the ai its a little too rough at times so the balance is funky. bosses and enemies roaming the areas are skewed to either being way too easy or honestly just frustrating at times.- and a few other problems with animation keep me from recommending the game at full price.overall, the game is good, it just feels like it lacks a sense of polish that would make it worth the 60$. If the polish ever does come around though, ill update the review for sure.			"
Recommended,75.4,"																It's more than just an anime Dark Souls. It has unique game mechanics and an interesting story.

Recommended,35.7,"																It's a good game for souls-type fans who can stand cartoon-type graphics. Interesting and easy to follow story, fun bosses and different fight styles gave me a good vibes. I really liked the dynamic class idea and really cool fight-mage style without need to rest near campfire every 2-3 mobs to restore mana. On the bad side I can admit crappy multiplayer and really insane invasions (for solo at least) with hardly any rewards. Overall I had really good time playing the game and would recommend to take a look. But don't set the expectations high, this game is not a revolution or anything of the sort. Just a good game with interesting concepts.P.S. for those who do like achievements, this game has rather easy achievements except the multiplayer one which requires you to grind for 20-40 hours with no real benefits. Also, to get the achievement for viewing all the endings, you need to complete the game on the SAME character.			"
Recommended,512.7,"																TL;DR: buy it on sale, this isn't worth $60.Based on my current progress, there are things to like here, but overall I think the game falls very short.First of all, yes, everybody who says this relies too heavily on the Soulsborne trope of, ""lol there was an enemy around the corner, got you!"" are completely correct. This game is littered with those enemy placements, and it's extremely annoying.Map design is horrific. I thought I could handle it fine after the first chunk, but then I hit the Cathedral and my hate meter no longer has a cap. The game is wearing very thin on me. It's becoming very clear that this game is a hallway simulator with massive amounts of reused assets and basically hours and hours and hours of fighting literally the same 4 or 5 reskinned enemies throughout.Stagger doesn't exist for most weapon types, it basically only happens with hammers and greatswords. Even then, don't expect to stagger enemies larger than you. Backstab abuse is the best way to handle the vast majority of encounters, which has become completely stale for me. Unless I'm fighting a boss, in which case the best way to fight it the vast majority of the time is to just let your AI companion do 98% of the work since they can input read the boss and you cannot, meaning you'll get hit by basically everything because bosses don't have wind ups.Oh, and the bosses will just aggro to you like glue, so don't expect the AI companions to pull that aggro or anything.Speaking of AI companions, they need to shut up. It's very annoying to hear the same voice line for the twentieth time when backtracking through an area to find hidden items, which also goes back to the confused map design. If you've played Dragon's Dogma, you might be able to ignore this, but boy it's so fun to literally be walking away from a Mistle at which I JUST rested and have the AI comment, ""Should we rest at the Mistle?""Lastly, it suffers very badly from JRPG text tutorial hell. It's not... too bad, once you get used to what the numbers all mean and how the systems work, but good ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lord is it an annoying drag for the first couple hours as the game can't resist slamming you with a Moby-♥♥♥♥-size plethora of text-based explanations on everything.Story? It's meh. Not nearly interesting enough to actually make me engaged in the game. Many of the cutscenes are agonizingly slow, just watching a character walk at what feels like about 0.75 speed over to an object, slowly comment on that object, and then watching the camera change positions so it can do a different pan of the scene while somebody else walks at a snail's pace and then takes 10 - 20 seconds to respond, rinse repeat.Good things: insane amount of fan service that feels like it ate up WAY too much of the budget while the rest of the game is in such an unpolished state, but at least it's there. Voice acting is good. Character creator is top notch. Outfit design is fun and unique. But you aren't going to be spending the vast majority of the game with these elements, you're going to spend the vast majority of the game interacting with the busted poise in combat, the backstab abuse, the truly zero effort level and enemy design, and the bosses that suck to fight. If you're desperate or you want to get it for co-op, fine, but get it for $20 max.			"
Recommended,39.7,"																Anime Dark Souls, and not in a ""the Dark Souls of anime"" way, it plays like Dark Souls with an anime aesthetic.			"
Recommended,12.5,"																Weeb souls			"
Recommended,126.9,"																If you're looking for a new Dark souls, this isn't it. It may borrow gameplay elements but tbh it feels more like a traditional JRPG redesigned for action oriented combat. It's a bit on the easy side (it didn't  bother at all that i didn't level up the first 8 hours) and the weapons are unbalanced. The buddy system is cool but takes away the difficulty level substantialy (especially with Yakumo/Io). The graphics are a bit dated and the different areas are often not too special. There isn't much exploration sadly and the levels tend to be on the more linear side.My main gripe is that on most online forums they say the game can take anywhere between 20-30 hours and 100h+ for a 100% finnish. im at 17 hours now and according to a friend who finnished it already only 2 bosses away from ending the game.BUT nonetheless it is extremely enjoyable and has quiet the interesting story, the anime tropes are a bit on the strong side sometimes tho. I paid full price and don't regret it. I hope ng+ content is challenging.			"
Recommended,23.1,"																While the game is, in my opinion, somewhat short if you're just following the main story, the gameplay is where this game excels. Specifically the class system. Blood codes are obtained by finding vestiges and talking to allies. What I love about the game is how these blood codes work. You can master abilities in say,the fighter blood code,and then equip those fighter abilities in the marksman or caster blood codes and vice versa. The blood code system offers a wide variety of ways to play. My personal favorite is the Hades blood code with the Juggernaut Sledgehammer and Venous Claw blood veil. I'm like an unconventional berserker.Update: This update contains my opinion on the DLC. It's fun,but very underwhelming. What I mean is,you only get one level in the depths,but you do get (I believe) three blood codes. Two after the first go. Blood Code one adds a little bit of backstory to these areas in the depths and how the horrors are there,while the others are the horror's blood code and another random blood code. Sadly neither has backstory,but I'm fine with that. I will say though that I do feel a bit bored at the fact the boss in this one,and probably in the next two,are just god eater bosses put into code vein. The fights and challenges that come with them though are fun enough for me to overlook this though.			"

Recommended,55.6,"																It's actually not that much like Dark Souls. While it appears that way on the surface, down to the announcements of invasions, new areas, and victories against bosses, the gameplay and combat is actually quite different once you step away from the obvious features such as deliberate lock-on action combat.For one thing the game lends itself to much, much more build creation than pretty much any other Souls-like I've played. For another it rewards more player aggression, so if anything it's closer to a weeb Bloodborne.You can tell it was a title that struggled against budget and time constraints, because here and there you'll hit with reused assets, or uneven level design. Despite that, and despite the way it ended with three lacklustre DLC, I loved my time with this game and would recommend it even at full price.			"

Recommended,22.5,"																EDIT 4/20: Seeing as most, if not all, of the DLC has come out, I will say that I personally do not think that the DLC is worth paying for. There's too little content to justify buying at full price. Each DLC generally includes a dungeon with a new boss, also some new stuff to play with. Nothing that will add to the story as far as I know. I still stand by my recommendation for the base game though.Get it if you:- are into the anime style/ can live with it- are into great character customization- want to try the Souls-like genre but feel like the main Soulsborne games would break you- are animeThis would be my first experience playing a Souls-like, and I had a lot of fun. Veterans to the genre would say that the game is easy especially with the added mechanic of an AI partner. Difficulty is even further reduced if you play co-op.The weapons and skills in Code Vein are very versatile. The skill system (blood codes) allow for easy mix-and-match style of making builds. Though there are some builds that are definitely seem overpowered, every build is viable because the game isn't that punishing. There are a couple of bosses that I'd say are challenging; but for the most part, you probably won't be stuck on any part of the game for too long. Completing a playthrough of the game with all the side quests and stuff takes around 30 hours. There are three endings depending on decisions you make at certain points in the story.The story and characters are decently written, and the way it is presented is rarely boring to get through. All in all, great game. I just wish the multiplayer was implemented in a more seamless way. Code Vein's co-op system is similar to Dark Souls's, but I think the game would benefit from a more traditional co-op system.			"
Recommended,407,"																So, I just beat the game and my final veredict on it would be BUY ITWhy should you? well, because:1. The game is visually appealing: at least if you're into anime, manga and stuff like that. Hell, if you weren't you wouldn't be even considering buying this game, thus, not being on this page, but I digress.Stylish characters, stylish weapons, stylish skills and combos and stylish armor designs makes this treat to your eyes.2. It is fun in multiplayer: One of the most crucial points that made me buy this game is the MP, sadly it doesn't have PVP, but the coop is quite good, specially because you can ""summon"" someone anywhere without the need of a ""sign"" on the ground, making it quick to have somebody to watch your back agains't those nasty terrors, yikes!3.The soundtrack is full of jams AND neat sound effects: From orchestrated music to some light pop-eletronic-something music and the good ol' rock'n roll, this game has it all, so not only you will be very pleased by how the game looks, but also by how it sounds. The sound of the hammer pounding the ground or your sword slashing through a horror is something that will not be leaving my mind so shortly.4. They really put INTELLIGENCE in that AI thing: Your NPC partners in this game are quiite smart.Yakumo pointed some really cool items for my, as well enemy placements that I wasn't aware of, and that really helped keeping me alive, when I switched to long reange weaponry to fight a distant enemy, Yakumo quickly assumed a defensive stance and positioned himself in front of me so he could take the shots in my stead.I believe I fell in love with him5. Lego, but with skills Yo man, you can really create some cool builds in this game, not in the same way as Soulsborne titles, by allocating points to certain stats so you could raise determined parameter, all of your level ups in here are the same as traditional JRPGs, you get all of your stats sorted out automatically.Yeah, I know, I loved the autonomy too, but don't worry, because in here you can collect a lot, no, really, A LOT of ""Blood Codes"", which are ""part of the memories of other characters"" carried by their blood that can make you inherit their skills, and there are more than a 150.Yes, 150 skills.But every game has it's flaws, and Code Vein is a part of this. Why? Well, because:1.I swear I've seen that enemy somewhere before: Yep, you did, the same horrors you face in the beginning will be fighting you at the end, sometimes with a change in the color pallete, while most of the time it'll be the same copy and paste.2.Why am I the only one growing up here?: You fight Terrors, you earn ""Haze"", the ""currency and exp"" in this game and then you level up. Noice, but why I cannot do that to my partners? 3. Fire the architecht that designed all of this: You like mazes? me neither, specially because my memory sucks and I always get lost at it, even if I just beat it.Well, the level design here is kinda lackluster in a way, since all it does is put mazes in front of you. Not a game breaker, just a minor issue.4. Naw man, get outta there, I can totally see you!: If you've played any Soulsborne games, you may already be familiarized with the enemy placement of the franchise, and nothing changes here. Sad.Yeah, I know, the game has quite it's share of flaws, but hey, it is fun, I've enjoyed it and I even plan on getting all of the achievements in here, since I wanna see all of those endings, cuz doods, the story is quite yummy.

As a bonus: if i can beat this, so can you!Could use a bit more balancing (for example in group fights where you either pray at the altar of the mighty fortified Zweihander or get your rear end handed to you) but overall a good game with an anime flair ... you have to like that of course :)			"
Recommended,26.6,"																It's dumb how much fun it is. Babies first dark souls, with tig ol anime bitties. Easy buy. Story is very anime, as is the character design. Speaking of design, the character creator is better than any Souls game. Better than most RPG's. The difficulty is near Dark Souls 2. It's easy, but you can't just mindlessly keymash through it. It's fulfilling when you beat some of the mid game bosses but a good few of them are just a few mechanics you have to be remember.It's very responsive, the armor/stat system is fun. The level system is a little lacking. It's all intuitive enough to give you a ton of options for interesting build combinations. Graphics are really tight and pretty well optimized. With any mid range build you should be able to run it on high at 30+ frames. I get 60+ at all times on max with an RX580 and a Ryzen 5 2600. Multiplayer is very simplified, which is a nice change of pace from most souls like games having overcomplicated level-sync/zone-restricted/save-status co-op systems. No PvP which is a downer but maybe it'll be added later. Maybe...Only complaints are the level system being too simple, story being a bit predictable, new game+ doesn't change anything but enemy health and damage percentages, and a lot of the bosses were one shots.

Recommended,43.1,"																Conclusion: Buy it if you want to make your own waifu and fight with her. Don't buy it if you want something as challenging as Dark Souls.- Very good graphics. I thought waifu+zombie world would be a strange combination but it works quite well here.- Very good companion system. NPC can talk with you while exploring, remind you of danger, fight with you, and can save your life when you die. This is the support I need when I feel frustrated in boss fights.- Good battle system (at least for the first run). You can switch classes any time you like and this makes it much easier and more interesting. Also you will be able to farm a lot of exp making leveling up very fast near the end. This makes the last several maps arguably too easy (but you can play without companion/level up/etc).- Good story. Exactly what you would expect as a normal Japanese RPG story.- Decent level design. Compared with Dark Souls, Code Vein's maps only have one type of environment in one map. Sometimes a switch in environment could make the world more interesting (going from mountains into a castle and then into its garden, for example). Locations of enemies are very obvious and you will be able to guess the places where there will suddenly come out a lot of enemies and get prepared.- Not very good Boss design. Each has their different style, but I just can't accept they made a heavily armored knight moving like a lightning. I think they just ran out of idea of how to make it not that easy.			"
Recommended,37.8,"																Reviewing this as a Souls game.It's not bad as a first attempt for the studio. Has lots of issues, but also has some good inventions.The most prominent issue is storytelling. The basis of the plot and setting are actually quite solid, but developers failed at telling the story. Characters often start lengthy monologues out of the blue. No build up or meaningful triggering events. One moment you're going through a level, next moment you're seeing a cutscene where a companion pours their soul out for five minutes straight. It happens very often and it looks so forced and awkward. Really painful to watch.The other big issue are skills. Don't get me wrong, Code Vein has lots of fun and useful skills. But it also has tons of useless garbage. At least from NG perspective, you won't ever need all the stuff that activates during focused state and all the status effects. Nothing lives long enough to take advantage of those skills. In Souls you at least had PvP, where status effects actually had some use. And there were far less status effects too. But here, they just bloat the UI. Maybe this changes on high NG+ levels though.Next would be the player character is way too mobile and responsive for a Souls game. But to compensate this, basically every enemy has ridiculous tracking and super wide and long attack arcs - so even with all the extra mobility, dodging would not be trivial. The result is somewhat neutral, since both features cancel each other out. But, personally, not a huge fan.On the plus side there's Blood Code system and Blood Veils. Those are massive QoL upgrades to the genre. Being able to try out basically any possible build on the go and not waste multiple hours on trying new stuff is a huge step up and should become a staple for the genere.Another good find is the Ichor mechanic. Replenishing ""mana"" by attacking in melee is a simple, yet elegant solution to make spell casting less braindead.I'd say this game just barely gets thumbs up as a 60$ title. But considering it's a first attempt and it does some things surprisingly well, I do think it's worth of support.			"

No soundtrack has got me feeling some kind of way since Nier: Automata, until this soundtrack came along and completely exceeded my expectations.. Seriously, it's incredible. Go Shiina really knocked this one out of the park.The story is really well done too, the characters aren't in any way forgettable and my emotions were definitely messed around with plenty. Definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a good while, that's for certain. Can't recommend this title enough, seriously  buy it ! 			"
Recommended,49.7,"																So, let me start out by saying I am not done with this game, not by a long shot (I hope ;P)So far the game has been... Everything I've been missing since DS1, sure it's not ""Souls-like"" in it's story-telling but the variety of weapons and such does not leave anything to be desired, there is a clear sense of progression and a ton of interesting abilities and such to be found. Combat seems a bit onfocused in difficulty, it waxes and wanes like the tides but at all times remain enjoyable.The real seller in my book is the story, at least so far it has been an adventure.The characters are interesting and the whole reasonining for it all great.I am writing this review after down-right tearing up after a story moment, not because of sadness nor happiness but rather a fulfilled sense. Like the story matters... I give this game 10/10, you should play it 100%.			"

Regardless, it has more positive aspects than drawbacks making it a nice library addition for souls-like fans or anime fans. The initial character customization is superb and the soundtrack of the game is great imo. Io will always have a place in my heart.P.S. The DLC is not very good so the base game is all you need.			"
Recommended,6.6,"																I’ve played and beaten all three dark souls games numerous times. And I’ve played most souls-like games, and this one beats them all out of the park.  It’s got an AMAZING story, that looks and feels like an anime, and your character is the lead. Which  by the way, you get to create a character with one of the most advanced character customizations I’ve ever seen. I loaded up the game and hit new game, and 40 minutes later realized I was still perfecting my anime girl. Then the game loaded and I felt like the baddest of asses, the combat is satisfying and clean. As a fan of anime and the souls series I’m enjoying this immensely. Buy this game even if you like neither. You can’t miss this.			"
Recommended,30.7,"																Having lots of fun playing this game and talking with other friends who own it and see how we do in our own runs. We talk alot about the character customization spending hours just on it, seeing what we can create. Its very much Anime Souls yet itself still very fun and a different theme. I love the cutscenes and how majority are well made. The animated intro they have in the beginning if idle at the screen is amazing and I just want some sort of anime now related to it lol. I highly recommend this for all, I never played Dark Souls before however I enjoy this a ton. Only problem are a few bugs when purchasing from vendors and the white mist walls popping up forcing you to walk back and fourth, yet not much complaint. Yakumo is a bit op as a AI partner, but he is a heavy hitter. Can't wait for more content and to see how this will go!			"
Recommended,115.2,"																First things first: DON'T go into this game and expecting the same difficulty and experience as Dark Souls. It's not Dark Souls, it's very INFLUENCED by Dark Souls, but it's not gonna be just like it. I've seen people down-vote/rate poorly on this game just because they didn't get a copy/paste Dark Souls experience (that and because some SJW's don't seem to like anime tiddies but that's besides the point).If you like anime, and if you liked Dark Souls to the point where you enjoy it casually and not-so-seriously like many others do, then you'll 100% enjoy this game; especially if you enjoy story-driven games as well.In my opinion, the world and story this game tries to tell is wonderful and I absolutely enjoyed my first playthrough of the game. The combat can be complex and challenging, and thankfully the gear system wasn't all too complicated. It is VERY simplistic and easy to understand after enough time, and I think that's for the best for those who just want a game to get into and beat up baddies and enjoy a well-written story.The game has a few different endings, depending if you bothered to adventure around more of the levels or just breeze through everything. It gives good replay value there, as well as the fact that your AI companion CAN be turned off as well. So if you wanna play with a buddy first time around, then challenge yourself by soloing through NG+ or on a new character, you can do that. My favorite part of the game has to be the character customization, it's the most robust character customization I've ever seen in any anime-styled RPG like this before. However, it's VERY limited with some accessories sadly, as some accessories take up a certain number of slots and you have only a limited amount of slots to use. I can understand why a little bit, but I honestly think it'd be better if they removed that limit, or at the very least double the amount of slots that we can use so we can make more creative characters.The entire game can feel short, especially if you manage to get through the areas and bosses quickly and on your first attempts. However, I still think it's worth it for the story and that's where I'm mostly happy with this game. Like I said though, this ISN'T Dark Souls; it isn't supposed to be. That will mean it may not be for you, but it was definitely for me and I love this game. I highly recommend this game for any fellow weeb out there that just wants to make a cute anime waifu to beat up monsters and bad guys lol			"

Not Recommended,31.6,"																before buying...treat this as its own game...if you come in expecting Dark Souls or Sekiro, you arent going to get it.never having played a Souls title before, this game was enjoyable from start to finish. Its combat is fluid and entertaining to learn with a few minor clunks (camera when youre in a tight area/against a wall) that didnt really affect my time with the game too much. Learning enemy attack patterns and pulling off backstabs/special attacks once youve figured them out is a joy to do and adds to the base combat of the game. Dont know why people say the combat isnt...""weighty"" or ""responsive"" when enemies do flinch and react to attacks you throw out...Additionally you can also approach different enemies with the various Blood Codes and weapons you have, if youre getting parried because youre using a longblade against a shield bearing enemy then its your own fault, not ""cheap"" enemy design.The possibilities you have when making a build are endless, since the game has various Blood Codes you can find which offer Gifts that, once mastered, you can then apply to other Blood Codes (correct me if im wrong on this), this means you can chain multiple Gifts from other Blood Codes into your favourite/build to maximize your offense and defense.Enemies and Bosses have a clear attack pattern you can figure out to clear them with the exception of one or two enemies tha 1) move so fast you cant heal or buff, 2) have a defense buff/phase that reduces so much dmg it becomes a chore to whittle their hp down and they gain traits from point 1, 3) attack so fast or without warning thatyou dont have the time to dodge or parry. Thankfully the enemies i list dont appear frequently and arent an issue since there are ways to circumvent all those points to kill them.Map design is sortof standard Souls-like, with nooks and crannies, hidden ledges and pathways and the regular ambush hidden here and there. People will tell you the Cathedral is annoying to get through but really, the game gives you tools to mark locations and show waypoints for a reason...that and the clear landmarks and footstep system on your Map should already be more than enough to guide you through it. Use your items, use your map, use your eyes...and you should be able to 100% the Cathedral with no issue...Sound effects in this game are okay to great, there are some occassions where sounds like impact noises wont play but those were extremely rare for me (only occurred once). The music in Code Vein has to be one of GoShiina's best works alongside God Eater 2 Rage Burst and Tales of Zestiria. definitely give the OST a listen, even better buy it to support the devs.I dont have to say anything about the character creator now do i? You probably already saw plenty from PV's to trailers...only gripe i have with it are height and breast size sliders. For Shift, its a step up from God Eater and Freedom Wars' character creation systems.I recommend this game for anyone new to the Souls-like genre of games and those just looking for a game that challenges them yet offers multiple ways to play the game. overall an 8 out of 10 for me, and if the DLC is as good? Color me satisfied with Code Vein			"
Recommended,58.3,"																So far, I have only played in offline mode, and really enjoyed the game. The character creation is ridiculously good. Other than that, Code Vein features nice curvy anime ladies, stupendously huge swords, Dark-Souls-like gameplay (if you play with a companion, it gets significantly easier), engaging combat, decent level design, and a not-so-bad story.It definitely isn't the next great Souls-like game, but definitely enjoyable. I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"
Recommended,50.4,"																GOTY for me I think. This is the first game in who knows how long that I played for 7 hours straight. The game is fun, the music is good, the exploration is fun, the bosses look good and are unique, most of the weapons feel different from each other, and the game is tough. The only downsides are that the clothes and models have some clipping issues on most characters, and that the game doesn't seem as replayable as Dark Souls and stuff. In this game, you can change your build whenever you want. You can try out different playstyles and weapons without having to start a new game for it. Some may like this but some may hate it. Luckily for those who do want to replay it, many of the story sequences can be skipped (not that they're bad, just that they take a while, and it'd be annoying having to watch the same scenes over and over).I definitely recommend this game. I'll update the review if something happens that makes me not feel the same way.By the way, this game is sad. Everything about it is sad. This is one of the saddest games I've played. Be ready.			"
Recommended,52.8,"																Dark Souls + God Eater.  Everything is very anime. You are the Chosen Undead Vampire.  Vampires that have gone mad from lack of blood are the hollows. Character classes are looted from bosses and any skills, both passive and active, you learn from the classes can be mixed and matched as long as the weapon you're carrying allows it.  Combat is a little easier and more accessible than a Dark Souls game.  Your ammo for guns and mana for spells can be replenished by devouring and/or backstabbing enemies for their life force. You've got your 'estus flask' mechanic that can be improved via item upgrades found in the world.  You have a choice to bring along an AI companion which makes the game a bit easier of course. But they are fleshed out enough at least to comment about the world around them.  The character customization is absolutely crazy awesome.Give it a shot, will ya?			"
Recommended,20.5,"																Finally finish the game and with that i will write a better review, i also have to say that i play with Ai all so still not try the coop, probably will play more in coop in new game + but game could become more easy. Now lets start..This game is a mix between god eater and darksouls genre (i play nioh so i will say based on that). So lets start as a soul  game you carry a item that is your exp, weapon level up and skill learn. After you die you have to recover or will lose it, actually exist a form of lose only half but cause is rare that you can't recover it, just focus in get it. Now this make game have 3 varieties, tank slow, crystal fast and mage. And after your first run you will probably not have learn all abilities so you can still get a lot of hours just get it them. For learn abilites you need kill, after you learn it you can use it for others blood codes, that means that customization is huge, still is up to you if want learn or no.Maps are good for me, actually very good thinking in that they are a maze. Sadly that means you will miss item here and there unless you expend a lot of time looking for them... and not many times worth. Have no many quest and that is good.. still well quest appear at places you no visit so if you no go back you will miss them easily. Not many quest are good to do but some give depth maps, thos depth maps are harder and some even more harder that game. SO if you like explore and old school where explore was not easy, this is for you. Combat is fluid and fast as i like it, you can have a AI helping you and i suggest you do. Yup this will make game easier but sometimes games are hard without that AI, too hard. There are 2 things that you must worry, boss and blood invations (not players but a lot of enemies) those blood invations are a pain cause enemies appear anywhere near to you so you could be focusing in one guy, and boom appear one behind you and hit you. This is bad desing cause force you not attack and depend of a bad camera, still i made all invasions and you will get the feel of bad desing in 3 places, you will also notice that your partner will die a lot.. unless you heal her.. so learn do that. Bossess are good still a lot for not say all have cheap tricks of 1 hit ko. This is not a problem when you are doing with someone but solo with AI will be a pain sometimes...Now Ai, at start you will see that Ai is good and will help you a lot, but as time pass you will feel that Ai is moronic and could be better way better. Without spoil too much my Ai pass from help me kill boss to drain my hp to be my resurrect in case i fail. This means that Ai is bad too bad for evade attacks, seems they program it for use skill and attack, the evade is good at start but when bossess increase the numbers of attacks they will just stay there being hit a lot of times, this combined with the cheap tricks of boss will be you against the boss in the last 10% of hp if you are lucky. (at least i had kill 4 boss in that way)The story is fine, the game will give you all the information you will need and is well made. Now sadly as other as said is a little anime cliche. This means you will know how will follow the story, the game have 4 endings and game expect you that you do it 3 times at least.. 4 if you do the first blind and got the ""true ending""(lets wait code vein 2 for see if its the true ending.. but i think it is also... next is a spoiler so read if you want know about 4 endings )  now the endings are  really well made, true only got 1 but all are possible based in the story, sadly the true ending have two version depending if you restore all the vestiges of IO or not, if you restore it and kill the boss then you got the other true ending so need to not restore kill final boss and then restore and kill it again for get 2 endings in 1 playtrough if you not do it, then need to do all over againMusic is really well made and is a pleasure to hear in the maps, the images.. well see youtube and the compare that people do they like to critice that.. in my opinion if you like what you read up.. buy it and if you don't like the images in the first 2 hours refound it. So well i do recommend it.. yup i do, more if you are fan of god eater.... do a fan of dark souls will like it.. i doubt it. This games seems made for play in coop, Ai will screw you a lot so will feel easy at start and too hard at the end. Still could be good for your time as long you not expect a dark souls (or nioh in my case). Finally i usully dont like put a note, but this game got a lot of contreversy cause appear the anime haters giving a 0, and the anime fans giving a 10... in my opinion is a solid 8/10. combat is well made and if you master parry or evade ( i do evade ) combat will satisface a lot, story is fine even if you don't like cliches thanks to the 3 endings (normal is probably better for no anime fans, but in my opinion all are good), sadly fails in terms of AI, the cheap bossess tricks, the bad executions of blood invasions.

Recommended,11.3,"																My boyfriend gifted me this game. This game is ""fine"", but I'm not impressed with it, and I would not have paid $60 for it.The developers tried to learn from darksouls. Arguably, This game is a better anime darksouls, but darksouls is clunky and overrated trash. Dark Souls is a bad example to be raised by for reasons other comments touch on.You can tell this game had a troubled development and was rushed to meet some kind of strategic timetable for a publicly traded company to appease investors. It has real dips and peaks in quality. The anime aesthetic is FANTASTIC OwO , but the Cutscenes have so much clipping, aghhh it's absolutely disgusting. The co-op is needlessly ""no fun allowed"" for real, please don't just instance the multiplayer and make them leave when we wipe, I obviously still need help! If I am going to the trouble to bring my specifically password selected friend in, let them go everywhere with me! Even to home base! ""It will make the game too easy"" THAT'S THE POINT. But fine, fine, whatever. You can tell even the devs knew the level exploration could get boring, so they flood you with enemies randomly.Unlike Darksouls, this game is actually playable difficulty, but it does not feel like a strategically designed challenge, just big numbers and ""You Died"". Where is my difficulty slider? If you don't add one, please take a page out of Legend of Zelda BOTW and Twilight Princess Boss design.TLDR: If you enjoy clunky ""2hard4U"" trash like dark souls, but want half-polished animUwU edgelord version that is somehow a slight improvement. Wait for 50-70% off sale and pick this up, otherwise forget this game.Edit: originally I did not enjoy this game as much, but it's charm grows the more you know and play, I may be overleveling at this point, but the difficulty can actually get pretty comfortable if you like. I originally stated this game is just below recommendable, now I am reconsidering. It takes at least 10-20 hours to get into the meat of the game. I will say they  spent too long before showing the protagonist story in full.			"

Recommended,98.7,"																I went into this game knowing it would be ""anime-dark souls"", and for better or worse it's exactly that.Code Vein plays perfectly fine but it imitates the Souls formula with no charm or understanding of the source material. There are small gripes like animations and sound effects missing impact and weight, but most of the game quickly becomes a bothersome chore, with design choices that fight the spirit of the Souls games it's based off of.This game goes out of its way to absolve any tension or surprise every chance it gets. Enemy ambushes are telegraphed miles in advance with combat music that starts before you even see the mob. Your AI companion will constantly spout out things like ""I think there might be enemies.""...""I think there's a path DOWN THERE."" Code Vein has no confidence that you'll be able to figure anything out by yourself and it likes to spoil its own surprises. The game's world also feels incredibly bland. After the initial awe of a new area passes, you just feel like you are wandering around the same restrictive hallways. Nothing is designed with distinct landmarks that makes exploration meaningful, instead you get a minimap that just shows where you've gone. (The minimap was literally implemented because of how indistinguishable every location is and you really feel it in some parts of the game) Nothing ever clever is done with the level design even past the visuals. The most clever things they ever do is occasionally hide pretty obvious paths you can drop down onto and they have one iconic Indiana Jones style boulder area.I know most of this game's audience probably enjoys these types of stories (which is fine), but I couldn't stand it. Code Vein falls prey to tiresome anime tropes, uninspired character designs, and an overuse of anime buzz-words to make the story seem more heady and interesting than it really is. I get the impression Code Vein wanted a universe as rich with lore like any of the souls game, but most of it comes off as embarrassing fan-fiction writing. Thankfully you can skip most of the cutscenes should you choose to.Honestly if you just want an anime game with solid enough combat, Code Vein might be a good fit for you. I really tried to get into it but I just kept feeling like I was playing a more annoying and worse Souls game.			"

Recommended,22.9,"																Anime Souls is a cool idea, I think. The problem with Code Vein is that the Soulslike gameplay, such as the combat, is just OK. The world and level design though? Uninspired and boring. There's none of the haunting environment of Dark Souls, the eerie atmosphere of Bloodbourne, or the breathtaking world of Elden Ring. The levels are just very generic and repetitive. The enemies are mostly just boring. The story is not terrible but very cliched and not memorable. I found myself just skipping through the very long cutscenes so I could get on with the game. It was difficult to make myself care about any of the characters or the plot.Overall it just feels like a mediocre game. I think an anime Soulslike can work, but Code Vein drops the ball on a lot of things that makes the games that it takes inspiration from great.			"

Recommended,53.5,"																A game that is much better than I think people give it credit for. I can honestly say it's my favorite Souls-like/clone.Code Vein is summed up by many people as Anime Dark Souls; it's actually more like Bloodborne in speed and promoting aggression but that's neither here nor there. The comparison is pretty accurate but there are a number of things that set it apart so that if you play it as straight Souls game you may not have a good time. But enough preamble.Code Vein is the story of a world after an apocalypse brought on by Horrors humanity had to fight by essentially turning into undying vampires called Revenants. A small slice of humanity sequestered themselves in a red barrier created by the most powerful Revenant who lost control of her powers and had to be killed. You awake alongside your big boobie deferential anime girl with little memory of how you got there and almost lose control and turn into a Lost. That’s a VERY abbreviated version of a VERY involved story.The biggest distinction from Dark Souls can be seen here in that it has a very very large narrative element: lots of dialogue, cutscenes and characters. An actual A to B storyline. While hitting a lot of anime tropes, it executes the story quite well. The VA commit themselves to taking the dialogue and situations seriously so it all just feels very genuine. There are also a number of story beats and especially character stories that actually were written quite well and avoided those tropes we’re used to. The characters get fleshed out quite well and even your blank stare walking set of boobs gets development. If you’re looking for esoteric lore and a sense of loneliness and oppression you won’t find it here but if you let it tell you the story it’s actually not half bad.The combat is familiar to 3rd person action fans of Souls games but the strength of the game is it’s Blood Code system. Basically you can find memories of Revenants (your party members, NPCs, bosses, random people) that you can equip to yourself that determine your playstyle: this one is increases your Strength so you can wield giant hammers and has Gifts that let attach fire to your weapon for a short period or increase your defense, this one pumps your Dex so that you can dodge much faster and has a gift to drop a trap enemies can step on to take damage, this one is for casters allowing you to build up Ichor (MP) faster to cast lightning at enemies from afar. Each code will require you to change your strategy and equipment and what special abilities you want to use. It really has a TON of variety and build options for you to experiment with and every time I got a new Blood Code I was excited to play with it and see what it let me do.Level and boss design impressed me as well. It’s fairly linear, or rather each area is quite layered with many paths but each area is sequestered by itself for the most part. Not all of them are winners but I thought much of it was really good design and most were distinct and unique. There’s one specific area that I legitimately think is as good or better than most Dark Souls areas. I was thoroughly in love with it the whole time, jumping off bridges and getting lost in a very vertical level. The bosses are likewise hit or miss but many of them are big hits and were a blast to fight and figure out with really good designs and thrilling battles.As for negatives, I’d say the biggest ones were female character design, the long memory sections and some wonkiness with hit boxes of attacks. Every woman has some sort of sexualized outfit, especially compared to the guys who are either fully armored or wear stylish suits. It’s just very noticeable because there’s not a lot of variety and sort of undercuts that a lot of them are really good characters. And while the memory sections let you experience the pasts of characters when you acquire their Blood Codes, delivering some really really good character development...you have to slowly walk through them and stand still with no option to speed it up just to skip it which means you lose out on integral story moments. And lastly you’ll notice a couple times where it’s hard to tell what exactly is the hitbox for an enemy attack so sometimes dodging or blocking can be rough because it doesn’t actually hit where you think it does. There are some other minor annoyances but I can’t think of them off the top of my head.For real, I expected this to be a mediocre game with an anime veneer that just cribbed off Dark Souls but at the end of it I had an absolute blast. It is 100% it’s own game with it’s own identity and I think it succeeded at what it tried to do. Perhaps reviews were a little harsh on it due to Dark Souls clones popping up everywhere so people are tired of them or that people dislike the anime aesthetic but I legitimately believe this game is way above a 7/10. Heartily recommend this game.			"

Recommended,108.1,"																If you enjoy Dark Souls and single-player gameplay, it's a great game. Or so it seems, I wouldn't know because I bought this under the assumption that it was ACTUALLY co-op. It's not. It has a ""co-op"" feature but you have to literally do every single level TWICE if you want to play though the full story with your friends. The ""co-op"" feature was simply added in an attempt to attract a bigger audience to make more sales, and no real CARE for the EXPERIENCE of a ""multiplayer"" feature was really considered. Co op ends once the boss is defeated. The friend who answered the ""Distress Signal"" will then have to go back and complete the level on their personal gameplay (with or without the friend) in  order to play the next section with their friends. It's an unnecessary grind in order to enjoy the game with friends. Want this game specifically to play something with your friends? Don't get it. Unless you have time to burn. Want this game specifically for gameplay, customization, and the challenge? Go for it. Go wild. Thumbs down for what I personally consider false advertising.			"
Recommended,14.7,"																Code Vein is the first Souls-like game I've played/finished, and combined with a pleasantly discounted sale price, I can't say that I'm unhappy with the decision to pick it up. Hard, grindy games tend not to sit well with me, but this one feels fair enough for me to give it a pass. Some spoilers below, so TLDR: Code Vein feels like an easier, more accessible addition to the Dark-Souls-style gaming genre, featuring a brilliant soundtrack and a few memorable boss fights. A slightly unbalanced combat system and questionable ending path hold it back from being perfect, but it generally does pretty well at what it sets out for. Right, so Code Vein is basically an anime Dark Souls, where you play as a vampire that hunts giant monsters in an apocalyptic, ruined city. Not a harem anime, or one where you save the world through the power of friendship, mind you. Code Vein is more of a ""every character still looks fabulous despite living in the apocalypse, and most weapons you carry are bigger than some characters' entire body"" kind of anime, but otherwise it stays away from the more cringy tropes of harem love-triangles and sappy drama, taking a bit more of a serious tone with light-hearted moments, which I appreciated.Gameplay-wise, it's Dark Souls. Even having never played Dark Souls, most gamers will probably be able to recognize it's core gameplay loops: long treks to boss fights through areas of respawning enemies, high difficulty, difficult bosses, etc. Code Vein feels like it's toned down a lot of the BS from the original games though, like for example there's no instakill mimic chests and enemies can't backstab you. Just about every area will have long treks to healing/respawn points, but most will have unlockable ladders/doors that let you skip large parts of the map when you get there. Not always, mind you, there are a few zones that break this trend, but for the most part the game follows this rule pretty well.I will say that the general combat/item system can be a little confusing/unbalanced at times. Health, spell/ability mana, abilities & skill sets all have weird names, and the requirements for some of them can be a little vague. Sometimes you don't know how some abilities interact with your character, or to what degree (ex. there's two abilities that increase stagger resistance, but to what degree and for how long I still don't know, because the in-game descriptions are extremely basic, and the Wiki is more or less scantly updated). To this day, I still don't fully understand the focus mechanic, how it's gained, and how it's activated. There's also single-use items you constantly pick up, but beyond some niche elemental resistance items for bosses, and ones that let you teleport back to a save point without losing experience, I seldom ended up using them.From what I've gathered, ranged is kinda weak, magic is even worse, and the meta revolves around using big, 2H melee weapons. Even before doing research, I discovered that the Zweihander 2H sword (which definitely falls under the ""anime weapons bigger than some characters"" category) is basically the game's god-tier weapon: it does insane damage, prevents all damage when blocking, has a great downwards light attack that reliably triggers one of the AOE stun abilities, a wide heavy attack for crowd control & destructible item clearing, and is obtainable very early on into the game. Indeed, my endgame build consisted almost primarily of early/midgame components: I was a juggernaut using a Zweihander, an early armour set that improved my buff durations, and primarily defaulted to the ""Atlas"" tank-focused skillset for most of the game. Honestly, a lot of the late-game items/abilities seem a bit disappointing in comparison, and even some of the harder bosses can be made easy if you know what elemental damage type they're using beforehand, and/or if you grind enough to just wack them with your stats (indeed, many bosses I sadly felt like I beat purely because of my stats & lucky stunlocks, and less because I outskilled them).Wrapping things up: in general I liked the story. The worldbuilding was pretty on-point, giving you just enough info to go on but never revealing big plot points until it has to. I enjoyed finding other's memories and finding out more about them (even if not all the character arcs were enjoyable), and I appreciated how even the super powerful vampire characters still had vulnerabilities and weren't just unkillable, wise-cracking supersoldiers. Again points for not relying on overused anime tropes. Characters themselves were mostly fun/memorable, though I only ever took Louie and Io out for adventuring.Exploring the world for the first time was fun, especially when you didn't know when the next save point would pop up (though I suspect subsequent playthroughs lose their edge once you know where everything is).The soundtrack's also incredible, having a primarily opera theme to it, though there's not a lot of it (only 1h of music for a 20-40 hour game), and the real banger tracks only come up at key cutscenes; most of the time you'll be listening to the same two combat themes playing over and over.One disappointing thing is that, despite pretty much clearing every area to 100%, I still missed out on the ""true"" ending, because I went into one of the important successor boss fights without collecting all their memories beforehand, and missed out on restoring them to get the true ending. The middle of the road ending is still fine (though it doesn't really solve anything, while the ""true"" ending does), I'm just disappointed that I didn't get the true one after putting in so much effort. Being able to go back and restore the successors, without having to go through an entirely new playthrough, would be a huge QOL boon for players.In conclusion, Code Vein does a lot of things right, with an acceptable amount of flaws. I enjoyed RPing as a fabulous, purple-haired juggernaut who went around slapping things with a sword bigger than most characters. I enjoyed the worldbulding, exploring it for the first time, interacting with the characters and unlocking their backstories, though I am kinda disappointed that I got robbed of the ""true"" ending for making but a single mistake.Would I play it again? Ehh, probably not, or at least not for a while. I came, I saw, and I conquered on just a single playthrough, and the other endings you can just look up on YouTube. Would I recommend it to others though? Absolutely, especially if it's on sale. Maybe avoid the DLCs though, I hear they're all pretty bad.			"

Recommended,11.8,"																 A pretty good character creator bundled with an extremely mediocre soulslike. This game is definitely a very meh game, don't get me wrong it did keep me engaged, it's a decent game if you want something light to just have in the background while you listen to a podcast or something but at it's worst this game is borderline unplayable due to horrendous level and enemy design .If you've played any of the souls games you literally have no reason to play this game, basically almost every area in this game is recycled from one the souls games and the ones that aren't are so painfully bad you'll be questioning why are you still playing.Combat and character building is also tremendously simplified here which honestly can be seen as a good thing, you can basically be any class at any time and use any weapon with no stat or level requirements, which honestly I ended up liking, I though I wasn't gonna like the lack of build variety but I ended up really liking the feeling of finding a new weapon and instantly being able to use it without having to spec my whole character around it, this in turn made exploration and experimentation far more fun and worthwhile and helped negate the repetitive simplified feel of the combat, if you're bored just change your build and weapon on the spot with no downsides or major dps losses.Now the big big hook of this game is the roleplaying and the coop, since this game has such a deep character creator you can make essentially whatever character you like and a lot of the fun in this game comes from making different characters, trying to make characters from other series and seeing what your friends made, I'm not kidding when I say I know people that have literally spent more time in the character creator itself rather than playing the actual game.In the end if you're looking for a strong soulslike experience this ain't it but if you want a fun low brainpower hack and slash game or are interested in the character creator, if the game is on sale, I'd say it's definitely worth it.			"
Recommended,19.5,"																This is more than just a ripoff of Dark Souls. Derivative works are always tricky, because it's not really possible to match the original without being unafraid to add your own spin. Otherwise the work is always fairly safe, but entirely reductive. I don't have a ton of hours into Code Vein, but I'm 40 hours in and about 2/3 of the way through the game at the moment of this review, and I'm a huge fan of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, so I feel pretty safe leaving this review.In many ways, the games are similar. Level design is similar. The level design is not as good as Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne, but it's certainly better than Dark Souls 2. It's good level design, but it takes a while to heat up after the tutorial, which is fairly simple. Some of the areas are extremely big and convoluted, even moreso than Dark Souls 1. The Cathedral comes to mind as basically gigantic mazelike anime Anor Londo. This is a good thing. They also have an area like the Plague Swamp from Demon's Souls, which is not a good thing. Mercifully, this version skips the Plague part, which is part of an overall trend of making Code Vein a little more new-player friendly than Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro.Code Vein has well-developed and interesting lore and a main plot. Fans will note mechanical similarities to Dark Souls within the plot, but the similarities are only in how the plot drives the gameplay (go hunting for specific bosses who inherited great power, blah blah). The actual story is much more focused on love, loss, romance, sacrifice, and second chances. The characters are much more present than in the Souls games, and this is possibly Code Vein's biggest advantage. You get very close to the NPCs, and they are very well written and consistent. They begin to feel like good and trustworthy friends with their own personal mistakes and memories. The story twists and turns as much as a good anime and has plenty of ground to cover, to propel the player through the game without getting bored or feeling like you're running out of plot. This is a welcome change from most Soulslike games, which never really come anywhere near the original Dark Souls in the ""implied story"" department. Code Vein is probably approximately as long as Dark Souls, but whenever there are breaks in the main story, you can be certain they'll be filled by one of your party members' personal stories, and this is probably the biggest thing I'll miss when I play other Soulslike games in the future. I actually prefer Code Vein's story over any of the Soulsborne games, which is very unusual because I love Soulsborne.The party members themselves are a very welcome addition. Sometimes you just really need a good companion NPC to shout out encouragement during a fight, toss you a heal, and go full Honey Badger on the boss. Especially if that Honey Badger is a waifu with no pants. The AI is very solid; NPCs deal a lot of damage and only very rarely go down unless you make an effort to let them get surrounded and then run away. Even then, you don't lose anything when they go down, so there are no annoyances associated with the companion system.The game is pretty and pleasing to look at, and the style is a very nice mix of gothic and anime. I've never seen anything quite like it, but it is cohesive and convincing. The game is also well optimized - I've played it on a GTX 860M and even a Vega 8 integrated chip.The level system is actually amazing, and one of the couple big improvements over Dark Souls aside from the story, imho. There are many classes in the game, and you can swap them as easily as changing armor, and mix and match abilities from them using resources you gather in the world. These classes have synergy with certain weapons and blood veils (vampire cloaks, basically), and so you can build a unique class with a unique mix of abilities and weapons. There is a ton of room to experiment, and you're never locked into one class or another. There's no need to fret over wasted skill points or re-spec your character. If you enjoy starting new profiles and experimenting with novelty builds and min-maxing in Dark Souls, you will love this system. There are not as many weapons as Dark Souls, but you find new classes and skills much the same way other RPGs would find weapons, so it never feels like there's a shortage of loot.The combat itself is very fluid and fast. The closest comparison I can make is Bloodborne. It's much better to play aggressively and then dodge at the very last moment, rather than to play defensively. You can seamlessly mix in spells and abilities with no delay or commitment, meaning you have even more flexibility to experiment with different strategies and to play aggressively. You can mix in abilities ranging all the way from simple buffs and projectiles all the way to teleportation. At a high framerate it's an absolute joy just to play.Overall, this is a game for people who love a good story, good style, and deep and freeform gameplay mechanics. The level design is still good, but nothing that we haven't seen from other Soulslike games. The real appeal is from the way that Code Vein nails so many things that we already love about Soulsborne - the fluid, aggressive combat; the experimentation with new builds; the co-op multiplayer; the great visual style and wonderfully weird backstory - but then adds two vital new things; relatable characters with a huge story presence, and an even more rewarding skill and class system that no other game has ever tried.

Recommended,7.8,"																game is basically WeebSouls. Deep character customization, but builds are 'preset' (but you can make your own presets later one). This is where the game shines because it means you aren't stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ build if you don't know how to make one, and you dont have to be stuck with one playstyle once you have a build. Some of the gameplay in this game is amazing, especially the backstabs/parrys. It is a semi unique play style but overall it plays like a cross between Darksouls and GodEater whilst also doing its own thing on the side.The game is moderately difficult, its pretty easy if you play with an AI companion or you can play solo and this makes it much more difficult. The AI in this game for companions is actually really good, and they will sometimes carry you in a fight. They do everything from revive you to be a damage suck, which is very useful for some bosses but takes out the satisfaction for others. The bosses are sometimes memorable, othertimes not. But they do provide some of the more difficult moments in the game. Regular enemies are not memorable and become sortof repetitive, but its ok. Most of them are reskins with similar movesets. Overall its a really good game. I havent finished the game or played online multiplayer, but I thoroughly enjoy it.			"

Recommended,68.9,"																Great game, perhaps the best Souls-like I've played yet. It really nails the feeling of weight in combat that the first Dark Souls had, though the world design and plot are nowhere near as good, and there are a few issues with combat that I would tweak, such as a missed parry completely incapacitating you for an extended period, or how slow healing his compared to how little it heals. However the blood code/gifts system and drain attacks really make for a fairly dynamic, diverse combat system where you can almost build your own combos and movesets as you play. The art design is beautiful, although at times it lacks a clear vision.For anyone who likes the combat of Dark Souls, especially if you liked it more than Dark Souls 2 or other floaty, imprecise games, I cannot recommend this enough.			"
Not Recommended,4.2,"																Venturing into Code Vein felt like gatecrashing a vampire-themed souls-like shindig. The visuals? An anime enthusiast's dream – characters drop-dead gorgeous in a beautifully bleak, post-apocalyptic world. Gameplay? A wild dance, with challenges and deaths galore, like cracking the bloody code for a vampire rave. The plot won't win a Pulitzer, but unraveling vampiric mysteries is akin to binging a supernatural soap opera. Characters are a tad shallow, but they're your quirky battle buddies. Sure, there's some grinding, but Code Vein is the eccentric gem in the gaming galaxy.			"
Recommended,220.4,"																There's a lot in this game I like, but ultimately at the end of the day I cannot recommend it. Excellent character creator, great music, good build variety, but the world, bosses, and story leave a lot to be desired.Yeah it's anime Dark Souls lite. Easier than any Fromsoft game, yet somehow still frustrating. One moment the game is easy, then you hit a difficulty spike that requires you to change up most of your build and play style, and then you go back to your normal build because it gets easy again. One thing I'll say is this game can feel a bit grindy at times. In other soulslikes you usually choose a weapon, armor, and you level your stats accordingly to make a build. Code Vein takes a different approach by making premade builds that the player can hotswap at any time. This is neat because it means you can try any weapons, armors, and gifts (perks and combat abilities like spells and buffs) on one character. The downside is gifts are contained to their respective classes until you unlock and max them out. This means if you wanted to use a gift that boosts melee damage from one class in another class, you'd need to first buy the gift, then use that class to grind enemies until it unlocks. Alternatively you can grind for awakening items to skip the enemy grind, but this is one grind for another, so you might as well do both at once to unlock stuff faster. It's not a slow grind, but it quickly becomes mind numbing.Story wise, I'll be honest, I found it hard to care. It's a mixed bag of anime tropes and decent/odd dialogue. I liked some of the characters, but others felt like they just kind of existed, even with their backstories learned. It's painfully obvious who's important, and who's meant to fill the waifu quota. It doesn't help that a lot of the characters backstories are hidden in these collectibles called vestiges. Fixing them grants you new gifts, and a dive into the memories of characters to learn more about them, but the process to view them is ridiculously slow. Reading a datalog (their wiki pages) would be a better experience. Now I'd like to briefly rant about the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, the worst level in any soulslike I've ever seen. It's a maze of stairs and walkways straight out of the mind of MC Escher. Repeating structures and shades of white for as far as the eye can see. I'm sure this level has filtered so many people, not because it's difficult or challenging, but because it's a boring, visually unpleasing, slog. This is a shame because it's fairly early in the game too, and some of the levels after it are decently enjoyable. Developers, if you ever make a sequel or spin-off of this game, consider taking any ideas of bringing back this area and throwing them into a flaming trash compactor. Throw in Crypt Spire too, as it's borderline the same thing.			"

Recommended,550.5,"																If you’ve seen a trailer or any preview footage for Code Vein, the elevator pitch is clear: It’s an “anime Soulslike” – an action-RPG that promises the steep challenge and cautious combat that we’ve all become very acquainted with in recent years. Code Vein doesn’t simply layer generic anime style and storytelling on top of a Souls clone and call it a day, though: its unique post-apocalyptic sci-fi-meets-anime horror atmosphere stands out, and its flexible class system and an AI partner distinguish it from its peers mechanically. Some of those ideas make things more frustrating than they need to be at times, but in this kind of game, a healthy dose of frustration comes with the territory. Code Vein deserves some credit for experimenting with this firmly established formula in ways others often don't.True to its anime inspirations, Code Vein has a lot of story. Your custom character awakens in the ruins of a city as an undead “revenant” who feeds on blood in a wild, Mad Max-style, ghoul-eat-ghoul world. There are more revenants than people, which means food is scarce. The story itself is deadly serious, but there’s a bit of a wacky streak – including white trees that literally grow “beads” of blood. That makes the world interesting, but the wild designs sometimes felt out of place with the story’s bleak tone. You quickly link up with a likable but two-dimensional crew of allies who realize you have special abilities, sending you on a long and winding quest that’s equal parts saving the world and figuring out what the hell is going on. The story kept me involved (even when it goes off the rails) by unfurling details about the world as you go. It seems like everyone has amnesia, so every story thread has a mystery of some kind. While the revelations are never as powerful (or as clarifying) as those in, say, Horizon: Zero Dawn, the slow drip of information filled in my understanding of what has happened and how it connects to the people, places, and things I’d seen. While the main plot relies on cutscenes, many of the individual characters' stories play out through blood echoes, slow-moving story sequences where you walk (very slowly) through corridors with still images that sync up to audio logs. I don’t have a problem with this kind of secondary storytelling, but I wish that more of these more interesting stories could have been better integrated into the main plot, rather than bringing the pace to a crawl to develop its characters and deliver important details about the world.For all its twists and turns, most of the story in Code Vein feels very separate from what you actually do. You spend hours and hours exploring the labyrinthine caverns and city ruins of the revenant world, cutting through enemies (referred to as the Lost) in typical Souls like fashion. If you’ve played any of these games – Dark Souls, Bloodborne, – you know the drill. There are save points called Mistle that recharge your healing item; Each twisty, turny level has shortcuts that allow you to bypass certain sections when you have to work your way back to where you died; combat demands precision, requiring you to play cautiously, dodge often, and choose your moments. That said, your options extend far beyond the average stick-and-move tactics I’ve cultivated from years of playing similar games. Your character has an effectively unlimited capacity to invent and reinvent him or herself by changing their class, called a “Blood Code,” at any time. Each one has its own profile with stats that scale to your level in different ways, proficiencies for different weapons, including old standbys like heavy-hitting giant swords and polearms, as well as some unique options like the Bayonet, which has a magic-powered gunshot as its heavy attack. Each class also offers a set of special abilities called Gifts that, when paired with a certain set of specs, create a relatively distinct spin on your character. While the 25 classes I found don’t feel all feel unique – truly, they boil down to magic-users, rogues, and tank archetypes – by mastering their gifts you can mix and match skills and stat variations, turning each Blood Code into a unique loadout. Active Gifts run the gamut of typical RPG abilities, from buffs like Iron Will (which enhances your defense), situational skills like Venom Trap (which poisons enemies), and attack spells like Draconic Stake (which launches a spike made of blood at your enemy): As your repertoire of Blood Codes grows, you build a sizable array of options.Though you can often get by with focusing on just one or two, I found it essential to change Blood Codes and strategies to beat certain tough enemies. After going toe-to-toe with an early boss in a heavy armor class and getting crushed consistently, I was able to quickly dispatch it simply by switching to long-range class with support skills and a gun to keep me away from its poison-laced attacks. Switching tactics, especially when you’re figuring out how to apply said tactics to the attack patterns of a powerful boss, can be really tough to wrap your head around, but it's often a puzzle worth solving. Above all, I found it freeing that Code Vein gives you permission to try lots of different options with no penalty. It also helps that you have a partner to take the edge off. Code Vein’s other primary innovation is its reliance on playing with an AI-controlled partner, one of the other revenants from your team with their own Blood Codes and fighting styles. Since you can’t control them, I found it better to think of each one as a complement to your own loadout. When using a heavy class, for example, I preferred bringing along the team’s leader, Louis, who uses quick attacks and magic. But when I switched to a long-range class, I liked fighting alongside Yakumo, the resident brawler. In combat, each fighter’s unique skills feel more or less compatible, which makes me feel more or less connected to them. It’s on you to figure out how best to take advantage of their skills, though often it's okay to simply let them keep some of the enemies off your back while you fight.Having a partner changes the flow of combat, usually for better but sometimes for much, much worse. The good part is that because you’ll often fight groups of enemies – three or four at a time is pretty common – having a second character on your side makes each battle feel more epic as fighting goes on around you too. At the same time, once you get the hang of the controls, most fights are less stressful because you have a bit of a safety net. When the going gets really tough, though, things fall apart. Most of the AI partners are relentlessly aggressive and can’t really read enemy attack patterns, which means that in boss battles they will inevitably die if you don’t protect or heal them. And once they die, more often than not you'll end up dying as well without their help, even if you were just using them to get a little breathing room. That means your capacity to defeat many of Code Vein's harder bosses comes down to how your inconsistent partner happens to perform in a given attempt, which adds a frustrating amount of randomness to a game where combat otherwise emphasizes skill by asking you to time your attacks and dodges perfectly.You can take the AI ally out of the equation entirely if you want, but that makes things so much more difficult that I think the trade off is ultimately worth keeping them around. Technically you can play through the whole 30-hour campaign solo, though I wouldn’t recommend it. Given the number of enemies and the speed of some of the bosses, I found playing alone far harder than dealing with the AI's issues. Companions are also part of what makes Code Vein interesting, and if you care deeply about the story, your partners will keep you up to date on what’s going on even after long stretches without a major event or cutscene.

Not Recommended,2.3,"																Bandai Namco made an anime DarkSouls and it's pretty solid. This game is a pretty standard soullike game, it uses the majority the mechanics and playstyle you'd expect from that type of game. Two big changes to the combat to note are that the ""class""system is much more fluid and you have more freedom to add skills to compliment your playstyle and you have a companion with you. The combat system feels really good and ability to add things to a class to round it out to fit the way you play is a big quality of life improvement. Where the game gets some criticism is that it's easy largely because of having allies, which i think is fair because it definitely adds a safety net to some of the encounters but I think that it also helps new players to soulslikes learn the mechanics and adjust to the inherent difficulty. There are ways to solo, so if you're a soulslike veteran you can up the difficulty that way and it's more comparable to other games in the genre. An other highlight of the game is the character creator, I think it is one of if not the best out of any game I've ever played. In my opinion the story was decent, it could have been a bit more developed but it was still satisfying as is. Overall I think it's a really solid and fun experience for anyone interested in the genre and might be the best option for those looking to ease in to soulslikes			"
Recommended,65.7,"																This is the WoW of the Souls-likes:  it doesn't do anything new, but everything is done pretty well.It has some satisfying boss fights, a good selection of interesting weapons, and extensive character customization -- both in terms of classes/skills and looks.  I don't think I'll be heading back in for NG+ -- the alternate endings I missed and the few classes I didn't unlock are not enough to make me want to dive back in right now -- but it was definitely worth a play through, and I think this might have been the most fun I've had with a Souls-like game since Fallen Order.

Recommended,63,"																Waifus			"
Recommended,22.9,"																pleasantly surprised by this. It seems I might be in the minority on this opinion, but I quite enjoy the combat. There aren't that many different weapons, so I actually end up trying out all of them to get a gauge on which to use in what situations. The veils/combat skills have a bit more variety to them and was a bit overwhelming at first since you can equip 8 of them at once. I have found the story, side quests, etc. thus far to be interesting and I quite like the characters. The voice acting in English is awesome as well - was expecting something a bit on the cringey side but the VA's did incredible jobs. Character customization as you likely already know is massive and robust, so playing with the character you made is fulfilling. Coming to this from Dark Souls, for example, feels clumsy. Even at 20 hours in I still stumble with the controls and muscle memory default to pressing the wrong key - and in my opinion, remapping the default controller controls doesn't make sense because they work really well for Code Vein. So this is more of a personal problem than game problem, but something you might experience as well. I don't really have any fundamental issues with the game or gameplay. I will say though, a lot of the hitboxes or hitbox range on weapons feel strange, like they are consistently falling short of where I would expect them to land based on the swing animation and weapon size. The parrying with the veins is cool, and each veil has a different type of parry it can have, but they are difficult to use as the timings vary greatly. So much so I usually need to anticipate that the enemy AI to be successful. I don't think I'd prefer it being different, but it can be frustrating how slow the parry animation to ""parry"" is. A lot of the game designs are very gaudy, which I don't mind for the most part, but if I feel like using a normal ole sword of sorts - well I can't. Some of the usable weapon designs are a bit silly in my opinion, but it fits the world. Something beyond gameplay that you might care about is just graphics as well. The game looks great - if you have a good PC you'll definitely enjoy the visuals here. However... if you like high frame rates, be prepared for some hyperactive cloth physics and no jiggle physics.

Recommended,19.4,"																Anime Darksouls is pretty accurate, but a much higher emphasis on spells and you get a companion to keep you company + rez your ass when you die.Games pretty much what it looks like watching gameplay, very nice and fun with a good dash of ""♥♥♥♥ so close"" darksouls stuff.First issue (of three), are the maps not being super obvious about where to go, unlocked maps have multiple dead ends when in reality there are new areas there but you just don't have the map for the next area, little bit annoying and causes some confusion when trying to find what ""new areas"" are where.Second issue, I keep getting new classes, which means new abilities (once an ability is mastered it is available for all other classes) yet because of this barrage of abilities I still haven't been able to play a class I want as i'm still going through them all trying to master each ability so I can eventually use the classes I want.Last issue, I've found that your healing items upgrades/boosts are just scattered around the map and honestly if you aren't an explorer or don't pick up every shiny object, you could easily miss these.....Overall I enjoy the game and having a companion helps with exploring as well as boss fights, knowing you have a small crutch that can help a little, if you like the idea of an anime darksouls and the issues don't turn you off, go for it.

It's a good game, but then you compare it to its source material, and other stellar games like the Surge 2 or Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and the glossy image starts to fray in repeated instances of forced melodramatic piano music sessions. I digress.Pros:+The ability to completely change your character's build simply by changing weapon/armor, passives and actives, and blood code. All games should be built with similar systems in my opinion, particularly MMOs. I hate being locked into a single class, and this is perhaps Code Vein's greatest addition to gaming next to Io's twins.+Io's twins.+Io, we need more revenants in the world just like her. Oh wait.+NG+ with the option to increase difficulty or play through at base difficulty (awesome, wish this was an option in all the Souls-likes, infinite replayability) and reasons to play through multiple times (hint: you can't get all the blood codes in one playthrough).+Story is creative and unique, it's also easier to figure out what's going on than the Souls series. I know, I know, some people like deciphering vague references on item descriptions, including me, but I also like cutscenes and dialogue with inuendo.+Combat is decent and responsive, but lacks the weight of the Souls series, and falls way short of the Surge 2 and Fallen Order.+Good character creator and you can visit the mirror anytime to adjust appearance, clothes, etc. Could use more variety in base outfits though and ability to adjust the player model in more granular detail. You know what I'm talking about. Think Conan Exiles.+Fairly diverse world with multiple biomes and enemies that, while being reskins more often than not, do change up their abilities according to the area they're in, keeping things interesting.+Huge variety of ""Gifts"" that let you really tailor your build exactly how you want.Cons:-Forced melodramatic piano music sessions, this game is the first that has caused me to set music to zero. Preventing you from sprinting in said sessions is borderline torture, and detracts from the otherwise interesting backstory.-Much more ""on the rails"" feeling than Dark Souls. Progression is pretty linear, the maps are short and, other than the Cathedral which is Anor Londo on steroids, lack the scope and creativity of the competition.-Lack of clothing styles.-Combat lacks weight, it's better than the demo apparently, but swinging a massive 2-handed sword around shouldn't feel like wielding a butter-knife. Not just in terms of swing speed, but also impact.-No body part sliders.If you ever wanted a bit of jiggling whilst saving the world, this game is for you.			"
Recommended,39.5,"																While “souls combat” is an acquired taste, those that already like it will really appreciate Code Vein.Great story, great characters, cute anime aesthetic, spectacular character creator. There's difficulty selection in the form of choosing to or not to bring along an overpowered AI teammate. While level design can be a bit lackluster, Code Vein most certainly delivers on what I have always considered the most important part of any “souls game”, the boss fights.I really enjoyed this game.

Recommended,29.3,"																8/10 if I had to give it a number.It's a rough diamond. Almost every aspect of this game is flawed in some way, yet the game itself really rises above all its flaws.I'll keep it short since I'm just doing this for the badge.CombatIt's Dark Souls inspired. There are spells, and you get special abilities, but the core combat is the same. That being said, enemies have a nasty habit of snapping to wherever the player character is, which means you need to use your invincibility frames, instead of just displacing yourself. Swinging your sword can feel like you're hitting enemies with an acidic pool noodle. It does the damage, but they don't really react to being hit.Art StyleThe art style for this game is anime. It's got some really nice visuals and art direction when it wants to, but as with the rest of the game, there some uninspired areas as well. There is a lot of clipping issues, but I think that's just something I'm going to have to live with at this point, and the crystals you absorb aren't animated at all which looks really weird in cut scenes.CustomizationPlayer customization is a strong point of this game, and deserves the praise it gets. You can recreate so many waifu's in this game, and even change your hair / clothes / accessories in game at any point for free. One flaw with this system however is that you have to wear a jacket over the customization, your torso will be completely covered unless you go with the smaller pieces.Level designThe design is superficially the same as Dark Souls. One area (White Blood Cathedral) sticks out as being extremely maze like and purposely designed to get you lost but every other area is competent. The levels however, don't loop back onto each other like Dark Souls and the game is more disconnected as a result.StoryIf you like anime, you'll like this story. It gets over dramatic at points, and really likes to dig into characters tragic back stories. A lot of the lore is reminiscent of Dark Souls as well. You're an undead who reawakes to an apocalypse, you're tasked with helping fix it and restore humanity. Every time you die you lose some of your memories and get closer to going hollow,MusicThe music is everywhere, Dark Souls liked to throw you into a bleak world with nothing but your own footsteps and the wind. This game gives you music everywhere whatever you're doing. It can get louder than the dialogue in some cut scenes, and personally I'm not a fan of the memory music.The biggest problem with this game however, is that Dark Souls exists, to be compared to. If this game existed on its own, it would be a really solid action RPG, but because Dark Souls is here to be compared to it is a slightly flawed game compared to what does exist. All that said, I came away really enjoying this game. It's an interesting case study for me because I find so many small problems with the game, but overall it is really solid.			"

Recommended,84.2,"																First, if you don't like Dark Souls or anime, you should probably try something else. Graphics. Named characters are drawn beautifully, especially female ones :) Artists did great job incorporating supposedly anime characters into 3D. World setting is fitting to souls-like game, where chaos and destruction prevail. Enemies look rather bland but some boss designs are nice.Gameplay. Game has plenty of souls-like features such as bonfires (mistles), souls currency (haze) and co-op which is available until main boss of location falls. You get NPC companion to follow you and also possibility to summon one player, you can always switch NPC ally to another available or opt out and play solo. Code Vein Is much easier and has less weapon variety than DS but game’s mechanics allow you to be more flexible by changing class/skills/equipment midgame without need to respec/visit safezone/checkpoint/etc. Also, you may learn particular skills to use them in conjunction with other classes so in the end, basic stats of class matter, everything else is interchangeable to capitalize on chosen playstyle. Still, most enemies are as bland gameplay-wise as they look, most of them you’ll meet again and again, but as stronger iterations. Also, some maps are tedious because of labyrinth-like structure (the only way to progress is to find hidden path/ledge). Plot. Unlike Dark Souls, plot actually exists. It’s not very deep and expansive but you’ll get clear idea of what’s happening and why you kill stuff. Companions you meet on your journey definitely won’t let you feel lonely even if you decided not to use them in actual battles. There is a part where you need to check characters’ memories which allows to unlock more skills but it can get boring, the worst part is ignoring it may cost you class unlocks. And ending is bad.It was fun while it lasted, but its 3.5/5, game could use some variety in general. Like weapons, enemies, levels and stuff but otherwise it was time nicely spent.			"
Recommended,52.4,"																So I just beat the game and I gotta say it was a great play. I failed to get the true ending since I missed out on a single item before killing one of the bosses,but since it's a souls-like this is the kind of stuff you should see coming a mile away. Since everyone else has already spoken about everything else I'm just gonna talk about some of my favorite things about the game. Let's start with music,it's absolutely great. Sound design is hit or miss though but I can't really complain much about any of the audio in the game. Personally I don't even mind the high pitched bonf... Mistle sound.One thing that's a MASSIVE point in this game's favor when compared to any of the souls games or other souls-like games I've played is that this is the only game in this style where playing as a caster is actually fun. Seriously later on in the game you get some really damn cool spells and because of the way you regain your ichor ''kinda like mana'' by just hitting things the game itself encourages a very entertaining hybrid style of play where you cast your spells,then beat up the enemies for a bit to increase your max ichor and to regain it and then it's back to casting spells. And since the game is really fast paced if you're using a faster weapon that transition from being out of mana to being able to cast quite a lot of spells again is extremely short. Especially if you build into increasing drain with at least one passive ability. I really wish other games in the genre had something like this. In souls series itself you either relied on mana or had set amount of castings,wish those games had such an organic way of getting mana back. If they did that I might actually play a caster in those games.The character creation system is also great. I managed to create a pretty convincing Alucard from castlevania and that added quite a bit of enjoyment to the experience as a whole. I gotta say even though I wasn't huge fan of the story since it's very melodramatic in that ''anime way''. However that's probably just because I don't like anime at all but if you do you'll probably enjoy the story too. However the LORE is incredible. Even if the story itself wasn't that engaging I very much like the lore of this world and I can't wait for DLC to come out and if the sequel can smooth out some of the rough edges that are here at the moment this is gonna be one helluva series of games and I really hope to see more of it.For now though I'm gonna go into what they call True NG+ which is basically speed run mode and grab few blood codes that I didn't get on first run and after that I'll go into the Enhanced NG+ which makes the game harder and I'll get that true ending.

Recommended,66.7,"																It's great and more my style than the soulsbourne games, mostly because it's easier but also due to the anime love.Although when I think about it, it's not more enjoyable than bloodborne, but definitely the souls-games.Combat is varied and fun with a lot of classes and skills. Enemies and bosses are fun enough.The world is pretty boring and basic, but I mostly love the challenge and enemy placement which this game does right.graphics is good enough, very mixed from highly detailed characters to low-res textures in the world.I recommend it but not at full price, get it att 33-50% off and it's a great deal!

Recommended,16.2,"																I gotta say my experience so far with this game has been great. I love the dark souls feel to it. (if you say this game isn't like dark souls then you have issues) You kill enemies, obtain haze similar to dark souls/bloodborne/the surge, and you use said stuff to level up your characters, enhance equipment, unlock new gifts and so on. If you die while carrying haze you will have one life left to re-obtain them and if you die again they will be lost forever. they did however add a feature into the game to where if you died and dropped them you can return to your base/safe house and use the hot springs to obtain half of the haze you lost but will lose the other half forever if the area was to hard to fight your way back to. The companion system is nice being able to use an npc to fight with you but i feel they need to be updated badly as they tend to get in the way, attempt to run up on bosses a lot risking everything just to end up dead in the end or you can use half your health to revive them only to get struck down just to watch your ally use all but 1 hp to bring you back just to watch them die again on a revive cool-down timer causing them to die permanently (until you reach a safe point) because you couldn't bring them back...Also please allow a second customizable character to be used as an npc so we can level them up and gear them the way we want for support/offense/defense or whatever you would like them to be.If you're a fan of anime and like the style of dark souls then look no further you weebs.To sum up my review i do recommend this game as it is fun and the character customization is fantastic and the story is decent along with the soundtrack featured.

Recommended,19.5,"																To be honest, i bought this game in the early August of last year but never actually played it until a month ago - i fell in love! The artstyle is immensely awesome, the effects and the lighting of some of the stages blew me away. of course, there were a few minor bugs here and there but it wasn't that bad overall. The bossfights were hard in the beginning (at least for me) but eventually got easier the more i put effort into making a good build for my character. The character design was complex and you could really do a lot of modificating to get the best out of your character. Multiple endings and a new game with stronger monsters once you finished your first run through :) I would recommend getting this game and emerging yourself into it as it is one of the best soulslike games that i personally played.

Recommended,126.4,"																Nice game.Anime + Soul-like. And has panties and big boobs with cleavages!Who hates boobs and panties? I have to say this game is awesome just only because of them!!Difficulty is a little bit annoying because I'm not good in action games like Dark Souls.I'm actually just a hentai gamer.But I could beat all bosses finally. So I guess players who're good in this kind of games could feel this is too easy.Story is kind of serious and sad but it's still like a juvenile.I got to love characters in this game with their impressive episodes.I can recommend that you read all episodes without skipping.If you found this game is on sale, why not get it!Even if it's on full price, I still think it's worth it.But if I had to give a warning, it's about the achievement that is related to multi-play.When all players are tired of this game and gone, we will not be able to complete all achievements anymore.Since we have to beat about 400 bosses in multi-play to get the achievement.-------------------------It took about 90 hours to get all achievements.And there's obviously nothing to do anymore.So I'd say this game's battery would die in 90 hours for almost all players.I won't say it's worth the price or not.

Recommended,36.7,"																Code Vein is a game inspired by Dark Souls that lean to cater to its players needs for cosmetics and flexibility rather than techniques and rewarding difficultiesIn short, it is quite a bit more enjoyable. I won't be as far as calling Code Vein a Souls like, because the only thing Code Vein resembles is a part of Dark Souls' system. So as I said Code Vein cater to cosmetics and flexibility. The game provides you with multitudes of accessories that can be placed virtually anywhere at any angle with any sizes and plethora of color options. That alone make it possible for you to make any character you want albeit you don't have that many choices on body and face options. But, all that possibilities and the dev got no choice but to limit the accessories you can wear at one time. Arguably because it could destroy multiplayer completely. So yeah, super awesome character creation with understandable limit.Now about flexibility, I'm not talking about weapon choices here, but classes that the game called Blood Codes. So the thing is, there are Blood Codes that you can find in the game. Each with their own stat scaling and skills. The Blood Codes you use matters with the armor and weapon you are using, because the scaling will limit you on what armor and weapon you can effectively use. The star player in this are the skills. I did say that each Codes got their own skills, use them enough and you can equip them no matter the Code you are using. You can even unlock them without using them provided you have enough materials. That all means, you can actually make any class you want to fit your very own play styles.To be honest, Code Vein is a tad bit too easy at least for me. I almost exclusively using axe for the whole game providing necessary staggers to bosses (my axe can decimate normal mobs like nothing) and buffs to my NPC teammate. That's right, the main damage dealer in my run is actually the NPC. Code Vein gives unnecessarily too much on partner NPC here, so much so that I don't quite feel like I'm the main character. I'm not the one killing bosses, my partner NPC is, I just give support to them. My advice if you want to enjoy the game for a bit more is, don't bring NPCs, they'll take the fun away from you. You'll die a lot more without them, sure, but maybe it's more fun.The bosses in Code Vein aren't actually that good. What I mean by that is that they got stupid moves i.e. teleporting across the arena while impaling you in doing so, half the arena-wide of attacks, filling the entire arena with ground-based attack, etc. One battle even downright combine two bosses abilities and refill their HP just after you defeat one of them. Don't take me wrong, they are not that hard. It's just that instead of giving the bosses varieties of attacks, the dev just opted to give them stupid abilities to make them harder.All in all I will recommend Code Vein any day of the week. It got its downside, but above all that Code Vein is unarguably an enjoyable game nevertheless.			"

Not Recommended,31.5,"																This is a great souls-like for people that are still scared souls-likes are too hard. The game gives you the option to have a companion that literally, figuratively holds your hand the whole game, if you want.Most of the people that say this isn't for everyone are just scared to recommend an anime influenced game. Virtually every game is influenced by anime, western animation, or action movies. They can all be dumb. In this case, the anime influence just means that half the outfits you can choose for your character will look really, really stupid if you are more than fifteen years old.For souls-like veterans, the partner will be interesting. Ultimately, you will want to turn it off most of the time, because it will feel like you are robbing yourself of fun (the red head will just murder everyone for you) and because it actually slows down your ability to learn the game for later on, when you actually need to sort of know whats going on.What I actually noticed after a few hours was that the game felt too easy, and that was because the controls and hit boxes were really smooth and never really frustrated me. Normally there is kind of a learning curve for the specific mechanics and hit boxes but combat in this game ""just works"" in a way that most souls-like games do not. If the combat is ever frustrating, its because you really just aren't sure what's going on or what type of attack the boss is supposed to be telegraphing.You can essentially reset your stats at will. When you move back and forth between classes, your stat spreads change, and so different weapons and spells do different amounts of damage and your health, stamina, and magic points go up and down. The true customization is really only found among your four passive skill slots, which can be used to increase stats or give passive abilities like ""gain magic points when you are near a poisoned enemy"" or ""do extra damage with parry critical strikes."" This simplifies leveling a bit (there is almost no way to make a permanent mistake) and you really don't have to make too many choices besides which weapons to upgrade (first) and which skills to buy (first). You buy level-ups, but don't permanently choose stats when you do.While the game's RPG systems are designed not to ever frustrate you or give you feel-bads, the level design is occasionally annoyingly repetitive. The biggest shortfall of the game is the cathedral (Anor Londo homage) which is essentially just identical ivory walkways and towers. They use two particular tricks over and over, to the point where where it gets really stupid. First, there are too many enemies hanging off ledges and they are so obvious that you can farm thousands of experience and easily over level for nothing by knocking them off in certain areas.   Second, the game over-uses ledges hidden under ledges that look like death drops; you basically have to tilt the camera over every death drop cliff in the game if you want to find secrets, and that is almost the only way secrets are hidden. The worst feelings come from navigation, though, even with a mini-map, it can sometimes be difficult to tell where you have been before, especially in maps where everything looks the same. Level design is easily the worst part of the game in general: maps are pretty generic and could almost be procedurally generated. There is a ""bonus map"" system that looks like it was originally meant to add on procedurally generated extra content, but instead just looks even more generic. There are few really interesting landmarks in the areas you actually play around, and all the areas in a given level could generally have been put anywhere else in the level without changing the pacing or atmosphere. The first couple areas are not too bad in this regard, but after the first couple zones it will get progressively more noticeable.However, even accounting for the level design, this game has a lot to offer. Souls-like enthusiasts will enjoy the combat, although you won't feel pushed to your limits very often. The anime story telling isn't stellar but shouldn't even make your cringe, either. If you don't have friends who never shut up about literally nothing while you play games with them and never had an older brother who could help you beat hard bosses, this game will allow you to finally experience those things. The allied AI is actually unusually good (mechanically if not socially) and they can take some of the more tedious experiences out of the genre. I actually used it at certain points for fun and because it made the game type a little more interesting. Hopefully the DLC will lean into the solid partner AI and allow use to customize their behavior a little more so that they can feel like a took we are using rather than a crutch we are relying on.

Because it offers nothing new on NG and has no PVP.6/10, get it on steam sales if you have nothing else to play.			"
Recommended,21,"																Thus far, I've put almost four hours into Code Vein, so this is a first impressions review that I may update at some point later on. Disclaimer aside, I've had a lot of fun with it. It feels closer to God Eater in terms of weapon-weight and movement than it does Dark Souls, but the Soulslike genre has had a definitive influence and pull on how it all works. The game is far from perfect, as the story leans heavily into several cliches, a few of which are almost laughable. It does manage to be enjoyable, however, and there are sparks of genuine maturity in some characterization of NPCs later on. Of course, the real meat of the game is the combat. It's fluid and dynamic, encouraging you to be more aggressive than your typical souls-like title whilst still punishing getting greedy. There are a few weapons I wish felt more weighty, such as the great-axe, but I can't find any 'hard' complaints. The soundtrack is the standard fare for what you'd expect from the composer, who's also worked on the God Eater titles. It's good, but if the music in those titles never particularly gripped you, don't expect a sudden shift in your enjoyment. Interestingly, though there is a sort of 'class' system, you gain almost all of your skills and upgrades via exploring and picking up various shards throughout the game world to unlock new 'classes'. It's extremely easy to 'master' a skill, letting it be used in other class paradigms, with the main barrier for it being discovering more pieces for your aforementioned class, and gathering Haze (Souls from DS) to unlock them at your not-bonfires. As an aside, much like the God-Eater series, the game runs butter-smooth on my medium-powered PC at the highest settings. 16 Gigs of ram, AMD 8350 Eight-Core processor, and a GTX 970. Ergo, you can likely run the game on something close to a potato at the lowest settings, so potato-PC-players rejoice! The only points at which I encountered frame-drops and other performance issues were in the first few transitory corridors, to reach new dungeon-areas. These disappeared as soon as I was through, and were relatively minor. In summary, if you like soulslike games, 'anime' aesthetics, well-made combat with a lot of freedom and fluidity in how you choose to build--and you don't mind a mediocre soundtrack, somewhat cliche'd (early) story, etc. then this game is definitely worth picking up! If the criteria above don't have you sold on it, I'd wait until it went on sale to give it a proper try, as I do think it's worth playing. I give it a solid 7.5, to be updated one way or another when season-pass DLC like new bosses drop. (Hopefully, we'll get boss arenas that aren't just big circles! Ah, I managed to nitpick myself another complaint at the end!)Edit: After a little under twenty hours thus far in the game, I have to say a few things. One of the most gorgeous areas in the game, The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, is an obvious homage to Anor Londo. However, it's also one of the most frustrating vertical mazes. There are three possible endings, depending on how much of an area you complete before a boss, as well as different Blood Codes (Classes) depending upon whether or not you complete all of an areas objectives. Ultimately, if you want to unlock everything, you'll have to utilize a NG+ feature and play three times, but the game offers enough customization that you can fight each boss in a completely different style. I still say it's worth the buy, especially for the build and combat options, but worth waiting for a sale if you're put off by other aspects mentioned above. As an aside, The Cathedral has the most interesting boss room, whereas all the others are circular arenas so far as I can tell. The Cathedral's arena is a corridor with various pillars. Here's hoping that boss arenas get more interesting in the DLC!			"

Recommended,46.9,"																i haven't beat the game yet but i will tell my opinion about the game so far, i will create a better review once i have beat the game.Anime Dark Souls. Okay not really, this games level design and enemy variety are miles behind Dark Souls, levels are boring to look at and there has been like 5 different enemies so far and the enemies barely telegraph their attacks and bosses are mostly forgettable so far. Not a great start is it?  But i'll stop talking about the bad things, now i will talk about the things i like about Code Vein. The combat, the combat is not perfect, however i still like it. Weapons have a nice amount of variety to them and most weapons feel pretty good to swing around, i found myself testing out every weapon i can get my hands on. One of my biggest gripes with this game is the atrocious healing item, it barely heals you and you need to use like 3 or 4 to heal back to full health so making mistakes is annoying and VERY punishing (annoying because of how enemies barely telegraph attacks and how they hit very inconsistently) Uhh what do i talk about next... I know!The companions: Some of the story important characters help you in battle and in exploration. I do not like them. First of all, they are annoying, they steal kills from me and they make the game easy, they're also a bit annoying to listen to since they like to repeat the same lines over and over againThis is all i will say so far, i said that i will make a proper review when i've beat the game but i'm not sure if i actually want to make a proper review, i'm not into reviewing games. Overall i'd give this game a 7/10, if i could, i would give this game a neutral rating but im starting to want to make this into a negative review.

Recommended,44.4,"																I have some mixed feelings about this game.I feel like the strong points for this game are:- Customisation- BuildsYou can really just make the playstyle that you want with this game. There are very many abilities you can use and builds you can create.I feel a little mixed about bosses and combat. I'll just say it isn't really different or fresh from any other standard souls-like.The bad points are:- The entire area of the Cathedral- Enemy scaling and difficultyThis is clearly an easier game, thanks to the companions. But playing without companions just makes the game too hard, because it was created with their help in mind. I tried going without a companion as much as I could, but I feel like some bosses and certain fights are impossible all alone. (Especially one where you have to destroy a bunch of structures created by the enemy very fast, which is (at least I think) impossible to do alone.The Cathedral area is very much a maze. The problem is that everything looks the same, and so very hard to distinguish and remember paths you've already been on. There aren't very many ways to orient yourself in it, and I did need 2 guides to be able to go through some sections of it.I feel a little mixed about the story. This one is personal preference, but I think it was fine, not amazing. I did have a few emotional moments where I did cry while playing. So from that I can get that at least it got me invested.Now, to be honest, if you're looking for a souls-like, or to get into the Souls games, just get a Dark Souls game. I don't think anime boobs are that important. Still, if you have read other reviews and found it interesting, I suggest picking it up on a sale. Not worth 60 euros.			"

But the partners, most of them are bad or not consistent, some of the maps are repetitive, to much time wasted on walking around, sometimes during boss fights or any kind of fights tbh frames drops, the coop is only thro a signal ingame, so if you want to play with a friend will take some time to match each other or not at all.			"
Recommended,18.5,"																If you’ve seen a trailer or any preview footage for Code Vein, the elevator pitch is clear: It’s an “anime Soulslike” – an action-RPG that promises the steep challenge and cautious combat that we’ve all become very acquainted with in recent years. Code Vein doesn’t simply layer generic anime style and storytelling on top of a Souls clone and call it a day, though: its unique post-apocalyptic sci-fi-meets-anime horror atmosphere stands out, and its flexible class system and an AI partner distinguish it from its peers mechanically. Some of those ideas make things more frustrating than they need to be at times, but in this kind of game, a healthy dose of frustration comes with the territory. Code Vein deserves some credit for experimenting with this firmly established formula in ways others often don't.RATING: 10/10Gameplay: 9.5/10THIS GAME IS LIKE DARK SOULS AND WILL MAKE YOU BECOME ADDICTED!

Not Recommended,29.4,"																TLDR: It's alright and if you're really interested get it. If you're not sold on it fully, wait for a sale.The pros:+Combat can be pretty fun+some of the characters are cute+there's no one time items per playthrough (looking at you blood rocks)+Cute anime characters+Character creation is pretty alright+The graphics look pretty dang smooth+Murasame & CocoCons-The entire Cathedral of the Sacred Blood.-Some enemy attack tracking feels a little too oppressive and some seem unfair-The characters aren't very deep-The story gets told to you instead of exploring and finding some things out yourself.-Clipping through character models is ridiculous. Hair, capes, ect. Had to go with short hair so it wouldn't annoy me.-World could be far more interestingRight so. I have a lot of complaints about this game. I went for a two handed strength build so bare with me on some things.So Anor Lando done wrong (Cathedral of the Sacred Blood) is horrid. Finding your way around with a top down 2D map is the worst. Either they need to be 3d or let you control the map more or both, i dunno! It's a horrible area your first time through and no areas aftewards are anywhere near as complicated.Cannonner's pillar of fire attack. I'm not saying it's broken or op but it acts like no other attack in the game to my knowledge. It's a targeted attack that leaves a lasting hazard and it auto targets both people in the fight reguardless of who he's focused on. It was the one fight I had trouble with.Which brings me to the bosses. My playstyle made it absolute cheese. Everyone took such huge hunks of damage that it was a joke. Last few bosses I beat in one go.I just couldn't find it in myself to sit through each and every vestige. I just got bored of the slow walking speed.Boreal Brutes. Just...screw them. If you don't have a fire attack of some sort they are horrible.Going back to Cannonner and blade barer. Hoo boy. When I first did the fight I expected them to try a Smough and Ornstein and then they... didn't. I was surpised and a little disappointed. BUT then they DID in the depths. Like. Why didn't they do this in the main fight? Cause by the time I did the depths fight I was too strong and it was pretty pathetic.The world itself just didn't feel good. The atmosphere didn't pull me in. You just jumped from area to area it Rarely felt like it made sense or had a reason to be that way.SPEAKING OF HAVING A REASON TO BE THAT WAY. The bosses. There's maybe... two that really made sense. Knowing their story didn't really help. Some of them, with the information you're given, just doesn't tell you anything about why they look the way they do. Except maybe two.With how jank the combat could be at times I don't really want to go back in to try new styles out like I did with DS and BB.I dunno how I fully feel about this game. I did enjoy it while I was playing it but looking back at my time with it, I just feel like it wasn't quite worth the full cost.			"

Recommended,2.5,"																Souls-style game without invasions. Perfect. Could honestly care less that it's ""anime."" Fun as hell and worth the money. AI companions are way OP, so if you want the ""souls"" experience as you might expect it, leave the companions at home. Go alone. Gear system is confusing at first, but it grows on you. Gifts are pretty awesome and will probably allow for some weird builds as the community works with them. The storytelling in Dark Souls 3 was great. In this, there's far too much talking, far too much telling-not-showing, and it gets immersion-breaking when I have to go ""repair"" memories for every character that comes along, or listen to ten minutes of cut scenes and occasional crying. I felt, at times, like a counselor instead of a badass revenant out to save the world. Don't buy into the massive hype, but don't listen to the haters either. It's in a place of its own, really. Not nearly as hard as Dark Souls/Bloodborne, but also not push-a-button-eat-a-peanut easy, either. I'm still on my first playthrough, and it's a blast. Thank Cthulhu some devs still believe in making *co-op* games these days.			"

Not Recommended,20.9,"																I thought Dark Souls 2 reused everything, but this game... It doesn't have many kind of enemies. But it is not the biggest problem, because going through areas are actually the fun part of the game. The areas look really good and it gives you the vibe, but a few levels are just awful. The game is pretty much linear, you can't decide where you want to go next.The depths are alright. It's a small map of already beaten areas with the same boss.The present system is good too, but the shop is very useless.Upgrading materials are bad too. You need 4 kinds of them. You will have hundreds of materials and it will be useless. Once you find the next upgrade level you need, it will be rubbish. I remember getting my weapon from +6 to +9 was about 10 minutes because everything dropped the item. The healing will be insanely bad for a long time. You need passive gifts for it to be not good but acceptable. The bosses are bad. There are a few good ones, but some of them uses effects to hide their next move. Few bosses will leave trials behind them when they attack. They do not follow the weapon's path.Also I hope you like stunlock, because oh boy, you won't be able to move many times. Enemies will always hit you and stop your skills. No hyper armor, no less damage. You will get full damage and waste your skill. Also feels like getting hit by attacks gives you random damage. Once I took 200 damage at a boss (Flamethrover boi) the other time the same attack took 80% of my hp. Didn't use any buff and I played alone.There's about 5 musics in the game, it becomes really boring in a short time. Also the character does not talk anywhere in the game (so far I saw 1 cutsence where it does say 2 senteces) but it has about 50 lines for emotes. Logic?I give it a 5 of 10. Not the worst game I played but it was a huge disappointment.			"

It's easier than most others because of the AI companions, and you both actually have an inherent ""sacrifice your HP to heal someone else"" thing. They can manage aggro/boost DPS enough to put you over the victory threshold. You can always drop the partner whenever you want.  They also cannot fall off cliffs unless they're hit by attacks or your hitbox shoves them off a tiny ledge w/o the room to hold both of you. It's funny to watch them dodge spam on a corner and rubberband to safety.It's also got the distinctions most other soulsborne games have:1. It's not that you're ""getting good"" at the game when you beat a zone. There's things you physically and mechanically cannot get good at, such as knowing where every single ambush scripted to clothesline you is before they happen, or enemies being so fast they can start and finish their attacks from range before the parry animation start-up can even pop the parry frames. You learn to cope with the BS the game's devs pulled on you, so much so that you start psychologically viewing the artificial difficulty as normal for the game.  ""Welp, can't use parries, it comes out too slow for this guy."" or ""It's a boss, looks like my stat effect build is useless."" or ""I bet money this is another ambush zone, specially made so I won't be able to see the ambushes early.""2. If you ask for a strategy, you'll get a 1000 helpful replies.If you point out you need the strategy because of inherent AI, hitbox, trial-&-error, & artificially inflated difficulty flaws that are only tolerated in soulsborne games, the problems cease to exist and you're just a hater.

You also CAN'T progress together, nor can you use the mistles (bonfire equivalent) unless you kick your friend out over and over.			"
Recommended,9.3,"																I think this game is pretty cool, but it's just not for me!If you're just a casual player like myself, not very used to action RPGs, the boss fights can be very hard to manage. Yes, you can always grind, or try other codes, but you'll still need to dodge, parry a lot, use anti-""something"" items, you'll lose all of your (haze) points when you die.Graphics are great, the system is cool, I already know the full story and I can tell you that it's not a disappointment, it's actually kinda of a continuation from God Eater (if you know the series).I think it's just a pity that we don't have difficulty selection, because if you want to start with a range or caster you'll see that it's going to be very hard with the starting codes they give you... so, you end up going melee even if you don't want to.... I think a difficulty setting in here would be cool.Basically, hardcore gamers are going to find it too much easy, and casual/story driven players are going to find it grindy and hard. There's a lack of balance in here! But overall the game is good, just play the demo and be sure if it's within that balance that you like.			"

I have not touched the dlc bosses yet, but if I look at the reviews, a lot of the reviews are complaining the dlc bosses of it being too hard. So i guess it needs more balance in difficulty?

Recommended,52.9,"																After the disappointment of God Eater 3, I had some mixed feelings about this game. Most people compare this game to Dark Souls mistakenly (myself included) due to similarities, however this is a third person action rpg with their own spin on the genre. It does not play either like Dark Souls or God Eater, and it will take some time to get used to. For me it took a bit for the game to actually click and get my head around the class system and skills, mixing them and deciding what felt right. Early on, I almost quit the game when I reached the 2nd boss as the combat system still did not sink in. After getting through the 2nd boss by coincidence the game started to make more sense as I have acquired more skills and fought different type of enemies. That aside, once you know what you should be doing, getting used to parry, block, drain, weapon hitboxes and skills, then the game starts getting fun.Visually the game is beautiful, sceneries, maps don’t get dull as there are many different layouts throughout the game. The character modelling is one of the best I have seen with tons of customisation options. The NPCs you encounter are well thought out, have always something meaningful to say and have some interesting backstories. You can dive into these more as you revisit their past memories, which reminds me on Persona 3s Velvet Room scenarios for some reason. I specially enjoyed the ones, which were made into cinematic versions. I got fond of some characters the more I learned about their past and motivations. Special shout out to the games villain, who’s character was in my opinion well designed, and the voice actor (English) did a very good job capturing the nature of it. Animators did a really good job overall in the game, my favourite scene was the encounter after the first Successor. Enemies come in several variations, sizes and types, you encounter some more than others, but I didn’t have the feeling that they are always the same. Boss fights can turn bad very quickly, for some, the hitboxes seem a bit too big or all over the place, but you can get over this by learning their patterns. Some boss fights tend to be more memorable, like the Duo Boss fight which was obviously inspired by Dark Souls Ornstein and Smough, which is fine in general. However, my personal favourites were the 2nd, 3rd Successors and the Gilded Hunter. The bosses’ story, character design and skills won’t disappoint, and the battles won’t get dull even after several replays. DLC maps, bosses were a nice plus, enjoyed fighting some old faces in a different game. The game had multiplayer options in mind, which was greatly appreciated, however it would have been better if they would have made the single player experience like how it is now, and the multiplayer experience more like in God Eater games, so that you dont always have to reconnect (and miss out on cinematic events).The story was fascinating for me, started interesting, and got deeper and better the longer I played. I was very surprised by the secret of the Red Mist and got very excited about it. By the end, you will have 3 (+1) different endings, where the True Ending gave me the most satisfaction and maybe hope for a sequel. One thing I would like to point out for those who would like to 100% the game, and for the Devs in the future, the Exalted Reputation achievement is one of the worst things I have experienced. Farming coins for solo players was a very tedious experience, took me around 10 hours to reach this. I would have been fine with a 150 coin goal, however 400 coins were way too much for any player, so please consider this in upcoming games. Felt like God Eater Urgent Mission achievement all over again.I would recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenge and can look over the sometimes-flimsy battle system. It is a great looking game, with an interesting world, with characters worth caring about. You will have multiple ending scenarios and good replay value.			"

Recommended,13.9,"																There's a definite Dark Souls thing going on here. Make no mistake about that. Despite any similarities I wouldn't let that encourage or discourage trying this out. Code Vein has it's own vibe and it's very well made and quite fun.There's a lot to do and collect and with a bit of character/weapon development most players, even inexperienced players, will be ready for anything they will face.The character creation is extensive so the player can have fun with that as well.This is as good a game as I've played for quite a while and I hope there will be a Code Vein 2.			"
Recommended,20.3,"																Code Vein is basically Dark Souls of Anime where the mechanics are actually the same but this game tend to be more 'forgiven' than DS as you have a companion that will help you in battle. In terms of game play, it is actually good as it provides many selection of blood codes for you to choose that suits your game play. I prefer the dash kind of thing you'll probably dashing in this game most of the time.The story line however is easily forgotten as you are greeted by many characters at the same time and as time progresses, you will become blurry on what is the purpose of the story itself. The ending is also consider 'neutral' for me as it could be much more better but instead the developers has to go the the easy way of ending it. Which is has more to it.In conclusion, it is an enjoyable game. I'm not a fan of soulsborne game but this game is an exception as it is a forgiven and beginner souls game. It is easy and hard at some point but you can invite your friends to help you or you could test other builds to maximize your weapon etc.			"

(Restoring the memories is a must imo) Combat was challenging but not to hardcore.I would recommend it.There were only 2 things that I didn't like. 1) The Armor/Weapon/Skill systems were very intimidating at the start.. until half way through the game.2) The last boss felt super clunky.

I know the game is suppose to be punishing the player or make it difficult for player to get through certain level. But the boss battle should be fight fairly and try to make player to analyze boss weaknesses or attack pattern that boss have and that make soul-like genre great.

So while it looks good and plays well, there's some rough edges.Like the amount of trash abilities, passives and items. Removing them and replacing them with more meaningful content would have improved the game. But it definitely doesn't mean the game sucks or anything.The story's not the strongest either.And there's some maps which are kinda tedious. There's a lot of good stuff in the game, but a lot of meh stuff as well.But honestly, it's quite entertaining and you do wanna keep playing it.Does it matter if it's not 9/10 or 10/10 if it's fun and entertaining and makes you wanna play it?I do like. But if you've never played any games before and someone injects you with a deadly venom and you're trapped into a basement with the ability to play any video game ever made, and have 24 hours left to play video games.I'd not suggest you play this one.

Not Recommended,38,"																𝐂𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐕𝐄𝐈𝐍Code Vein is a third-person role playing game with a meticulous combat system.I hate the term souls-like, reminds me of doom clone for people who didn't think of the genre of ""First Person ShooterThe Blood CodesBlood Codes are the game's form of class system they govern your character's stats such as health, stamina, gifts and even scaling stats that increase damage of certain weapons.Each blood code comes with it's own set of ""gifts"" which are used as either active or passive abilities.Gifts are unique to each Blood Code but they can be mastered which allows them to be used on other Blood Codes to make your character's playstyle more tailored to your needs.There are some gifts which are exclusive to certain Blood Codes and cannot be mastered to be used on other Blood CodesCombat Mechanics (Gifts)Gifts are the game's own form of magic they come in two different flavours.Active Gifts Active Gifts are spells or abilities you need to activate in order to use, they can range from special weapon-class specific attacks to weapon buffs or offensive magic.Gifts in this category require a mana source called ""Ichor"".IchorIchor is the currency of Active Gifts, they can vary in cost based on the individual ability.Ichor can be acquired through combat by simply hitting enemies or by preforming special drain attacksDrain attacks can be done by either holding down the interact button while in combat to charge up a drain which will grab and enemy to drain Ichor out for use or by in-acting Critical attacks such as Back Stabs or Parries.There is also a fourth form of drain attack known as a ""Launch Attack"" which you do by gaining focus from dodging enemy attacks or receiving damage. With a full focus gauge you can press your Heavy and Sprint buttons together to launch the enemies into the air, your character will automatically grab them with a drain attack to gain Ichor.Every form of drain attacks can increase your minimum Ichor stockEach blood code has a minimum Ichor capacity and a maximum Ichor capacity.You begin with your minimum Ichor stock for example 10/10 Ichor, but your blood code may have an Ichor Maximum of 30 which can be achieved by doing multiple drain attacks.FocusFocus is a gauge that fills based on how well you preform in combat, it fills based on how much damage you receive or how well you can dodge enemy attacks.Achieving focus will replenish the Player's stamina, make them harder to stagger during combat and enable you to better stagger enemies, it also allows the aforementioned launch attacks.Hostile Creatures and enemies also have a focus metre that acts in a similar way with the exception of the ability to launch attacks on the player.Passive GiftsPassive Gifts function a lot like Rings from the Dark Souls series and give you benefits you receive in the background.Passives can do things like increase how much health you get from a regeneration or can boost your scaling stats like Dexterity and Strenght.Some Passive Gifts are auto-cast by doing certain things like healing or achieving Focus which can trigger things like weapon damage buffs.Combat Mechanics (Weapons)Anyone who has played a Dark Souls title should be immediately familiar with the basic mechanics.The game even has a somewhat heavy handed (but skippable) tutorial to brief anyone unfamiliar.The main differences stem from how the weapons combo and use abilities known as ""Gifts"" to deal with your enemies.You still have your standard light-light combos but there is no weapon I have encountered to have a heavy-heavy combo.There are also charged heavy attacks you can use to dish out more damage at the cost of a longer wind up time and increased stamina usage.BayonetsBayonets are a new weapon class in not seen in other Dark Souls titles. Unless you count the rifle spear from bloodborneIt's a single-shot rifle with a blade affixed to the end of it that functions like a spear.They are best suited to the ""Ranger"" play style.Bayonets have melee swings on light attacks and fire with the heavy attacks, charged heavys also apply to Bayonets.Leveling UpLeveling up in Code Vein has been significantly dumbed down compared to similar title of it's ilk.You cannot choose what stats you level up instead you just spend ""Haze"" the game's currency to increase arbitrary stats such as Health, Stamina and Weapon Damage.This has the added benefit of allowing you to be able to play around with multiple builds without fear of commiting to a play style you may not like.The unfortunate side effect of this is the fact it's more difficult to specialize your build to something you like.AI CompanionsOn top of being able to summon one other player to play the game you can also get permanent AI Companions that will follow you every step of the way.They often spout dialogue about the current situation, the enemy encounters, level terrain or on what items you've collected.This can be disabled in the options menu if it becomes annoying.They can hold their own in a fight most of the time but do suffer from some strange quirks during boss fights.Sometimes AI will just start panic rolling during boss fights if the boss is doing a combo, the panic rolls can still last for several moments afterthe combo has finished.The AI will also sometimes fail to heal a critically injured player due to being in combat, but sometimes the AI will just stand there and do nothing only throwing a heal when it's too late.The StoryI won't go into many major plot details on the game's story but I will lay out some grievances with it near the end.The basic premise is you are a human infected with a ""BOR"" Parasite that gives you the ability to regenerate your wounds and disperse intomist to escape fatal injuries only to be reconstructed at checkpoints known as ""Mistle""Revenant require a supply of human blood to stave off a negative condition known as ""Frenzy"" which can cause Revenants to rile out and attack others.Revenants also lose parts of their memories when they recieve fatal injuries and disperse into mist, which can take a toll on their sanityTo make matters worse Revenants who undergo a serious frenzy from a lack of Blood become ""Lost"" where they are mindless creatures looking to feed off anything they come across.There are not many humans in the world to get blood from so Revenants use a substitute called ""Blood Beads"" which have the same effect as Human Blood.Incredibly Minor Spoiler TerritoryThroughout the story there are some minor annoyances that crop up whilst the story progresses.Blood Beads which are your supposed motivation for fighting your way around the world are completely unused in actual game play.They are literally a McGuffin to further the plot and are never seen outside of a cutscene.Had they been an actually valuable resource like Dark Soul's Humanity/Effigies/Embers, there would be some motiviation to go looking for them.There is also one scene where one of your companions pulls a gun out on another Revenant which is seemingly ᴀss-pulled for that scene and is never used again for the rest of the game.It is also irksome that there are several unnamed characters that just go by the Adjective/Occupation format, such as ""Self-Important Revenant"", ""Meek Researcher"",""Human Woman"" and so on.They never introduce themselves by name and it just feels lazy.Closing StatementCode Vein is a fairly decent game and is worth a look for anyone looking to scratch that Dark Souls itch given the drought of games of it's genre.It is quite fun in co-op with a buddy and has some decently challenging bosses to face.

Recommended,90.8,"																I went into this game completely blind, with 0 expectations, and having never played a souls-like game before. I only got it at the request of a friend to play it together with them.300 hours later, I can say without any doubts that this game FAR exceeded my expectations. Great story, great customization, great gameplay, and great visuals; if you are looking for an Anime Dark Souls experience, this is it. I especially like the Blood Code/Blood Veil system that this game implements as a unique take on the Souls-Like genre. It is very easy to understand, and if you don't like how your current build holds up against enemies, it is VERY easy to try something different and see if it works better (there are even spots you can go to that are specifically made to let you safely test out your build!!!). If for any reason you are still confused about certain mechanics of the game after the tutorial, there is a list of hints easily accessible from the in-game pause menu that goes over everything you need to know about the core gameplay mechanics. For the more hardcore of you, if you start finding the game a bit easy with the AI companion, try it solo ;) You won't be disappointed.The worst thing I can say about this game (besides VERY minor nitpicks regarding the combat mechanics) is that if you are planning on playing it with a friend like I was, only the host will progress their game, meaning that you will have to play through each zone twice, once for each of the two of you.As of writing this review, the game is on sale until December 3rd. I ABSOLUTELY recommend picking this game up. It was worth it full price when I bought it on launch day, and it's DEFINITELY worth it for it's sale price now.Oh, and one more thing...

Recommended,34.6,"																A very enjoyable, more accessible iteration of the popular ""Souslborne"" series. Code Vein offers a very similar game play style as the Dark Souls series, though made far more accessible in both it's difficulty and game play mechanics for those seeking to get their feet wet in this style of games. The game offers a constant partner character to help players through the game (with the ability to travel solo for those seeking more of a challenge), a surplus of currency used to buy levels and upgrades, as well as a streamlined character development system where it is impossible to build a a character that is subpar or unusable later in the game, including the process of upgrading weapons and armor - both of which only require one single type of material that is easily farmed through the game's optional ""Depth"" Dungeons.Like the Soulsborne games, Code Vein also offers a co-operative experience, allowing players to summon others to help them in battle along side their partner NPC.Veterans of the Souls series and Bloodborne will find Code Vein on the far easier side than what they may be used to, but the experience is still very enjoyable even then due to it's detailed story line, very developed and likable cast, and it's solid combat and boss design. The game does have a few faults, however. It's level design is much more basic compared to the games done by From Software, lacking in any real puzzles or environmental challenges, as well as the environments themselves feeling very samey throughout the game, with only a handful really standing. Enemy variety is also lacking, with only a handful of enemy archetypes present throughout the game, and none of which truly offering much in the way of challenge towards the player.  I'd highly recommend this game to both veterans of the Soulsborne series looking for just one more game that's done in that format, and to new comers seeking a more tame, accessible entry point into the style of gameplay these games offer.

Recommended,25.5,"																Anime + Dark Souls = A Great GameFinally got enough time to complete 1 playthrough of the game and can confidently say the game is well worth the purchase. It has many of the fun familiar Dark Soul mechanics such as it's stamina based combat system and bonfire based exploration system while also introducing a heavy does of anime into it. This translates to hot waifus (and husbandos) who will fight with you and flashy ass combat. And I mean flashy, as you and your enemies will be teleporting all over the place attacking each other with magic and good old melee combat. Another plus to the game is that it is very easy to switch builds in the middle of the game because stats are primarily based off your gear and blood code. In addition, the game actually has a comprehensible story that doesn't require lore videos from YouTube which is a nice plus from me. Finally, the game is easy for a Soul-like meaning it's great first step into the world of Soul-likes. Alternatively, if you want more difficulty you can go solo without the companion. Overall, a great experience that I encourage you to experience for yourself.			"
Recommended,14.6,"																I really love this game, fluid combat, massive amount of customization, likeable characters, lots of skill variations, and obviously the waifus. Yes, sh*t ton of waifus from flat chested to big chested. Even the NPCs or some random character are cute. Still, the game has flaws like the clipping. Gosh, the clipping sometimes seem weird, but I could get around it. My main problem is that after the update fot the halloween  customes, everytime I enter the character memories, the game just lag like there's no other day, wtf? I hope Bandai will release a patch as soon as possible cause it's really annoying to see your character walks in less than 10 fps, and I'm using a GTX 1070. Well, overall, it's a good game tho			"
Recommended,31,"																Code Vein, simply put, is the purest Dark Souls clone Dark Souls clone and oh my is that a really good thing. Code Vein manages to channel that energy so thoroughly because of exactly how much it replicated from the formula we know. There are plenty of other games that fall into this Soul-like category but few of them manage  feel  quite like it's inspiration in the ways that it matters. From the speed of your characters, the weight of your weapon swings and the general pace of combat; it nails it. It's not just a clone either, especially when it comes to the leveling systems and story. Instead of the point by point stat sheets you might be familiar with Code Vein opts for a sort of ""equip a kit"" format that allows you plug in various classes that you collect and enhance along the way. The best part of this system is how flexible it is, letting you pick up and shift around a few elements to piece together a new set up to let you try out a weapon you just discovered. If you're a fan of JRPG stories or this genre of game, give this a look. If you are a fan of both, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking this one up.			"
Recommended,43.8,"																It's to Dark Souls what God Eater is to Monster hunter; very similar, but with its own twist.It's also the 2nd most anime game I have every played.

Recommended,39.9,"																I have been playing Code Vein for a decent amount of time and its basically Dark Souls 2 anime vampire edition. The mechanics are very similar to Dark Souls 2, the good and the bad. However there are some cool differences, like the ability to swap Blood Codes (classes) when ever you like out of combat & the ability to carry over skills from one class to another when you master them. This gives you many ways to customise how you play. For example I mastered the Ranger blood code's teleport power and use it on my Caster blood code to let teleport behind enemies in my face and back stabbing them to drain Ichor (mana) back.The combo skills are very flashy and powerful when timed correctly, the drain power which is different depending on your blood veil (armor/cloak) look amazing, deals a decent amount of damage and is a good way of regaining Ichor. My favourite drain so far is the bladed tail. Its so cool & reminds me of Tokyo Ghoul. One of the star features of this game has to be the jaw dropping level of customization for your character. I have literally created Dark Ichigo from Bleach & Kaneki Ken from Tokyo Ghoul. The customization options are that in depth. There are the classic anime tropes like little boob, big boob women, but I don't care about that no matter how much some hack ""games journalists"" complain about it. Its an anime game to its core, what do you expect. The Japanese don't give a sh*t about western wokeness & good on them for it. The devs clearly made a game they are passionate about and you can tell. A lot of western studios should pay attention, looking at you EA & Activision-Blizzard.I am finding the game really enjoyable, but the bad things that personally irritated me about Dark Souls 2 are in this game too. The camera can be a pain in tight spaces and corners, some animations can be clunky & co op system is pretty restrictive just like Dark Souls compared to other games, like Neoh & Remnant: From the Ashes (my fave). Overall its a fun and challenging game with many options on how to play.You can play alone, with an NPC companion who are actually competent in a fight and point out some useful information, like enemies above you or pit falls. You can also invite a player to co op with you alongside the NPC companion to form a squad of 3. It does reduce the challenge, but its up to you how you prefer to play. So far the game has never forced me to play a certain way.Code Vein is the first game I pre-ordered in years, after I saw raw game play footage from Youtubers a week before its release. Clearly they had full confidence in their product & I can say I do too. I have no problem recommending this game.			"

Honestly, if you want a new souls-like game to try, pick this up when it goes on sale. It does a solid job of scratching that itch, especially if you're coming for an anime styled souls-like. Onto the review...I'm not recommending this at full price simply because it's not worth the money. It does a very decent job, especially from a company that never made a souls-like game, at taking what made souls-like games what they are. Combat is punishing and requires you to think about your next step and how you're going to approach the enemy. There's a nice sense of exploration, finding shortcuts and hidden areas that connect to other areas of the map. The bosses feel like bosses; hitting hard and taking a decent amount of damage before they die.However, my simple word for people who have played this is the Cathedral. My longer explanation for people is as follows. The first quarter of the game do a decent job setting up the premise and the general flow for how the game will pan out. Once you get to the Cathedral, that changes. It's the most poorly designed map I've personally seen in a souls-like, let alone another game similar in genres. The map loops around several times but all pathways are near identical, creating this horrid sense that everything leads nowhere and creates a lack of direction. There aren't even any proper visual cues to indicate where to go. Unless you have a guide or have been through there before, expect a lot of trial and error.The balancing is okay I guess. It falls to the same issue Lords of the Fallen did by making you feel like certain builds are the only way to go but unlike LotF, you do have far more build diversity. Stats and levels are where it falls short the most. Stats come from your Bloodcodes, a fancy way of saying class. The game has a lot of these and you can mix and match parts of other codes but your level determines how high your stats are based on your Bloodcode; you do not level your stats as you level up. Now I'm fine with this system but it is one of Code Veins' lower points.Weapons are quite nice; each having a unique move-set while some are similar to others. In the right hands, each weapon can be viable to get you through the game. The Gifts (Spells) that you can use are also done nicely. They do their job and some can provide some nice synergy with each other.The worst part about the balancing are the stun-locks. There is no protection to stop you from being locked if you get stunned. It honestly feels like Dark Souls II before they patched stun-locks. Since Code Vein has an abundance of enemies in some areas, many of those enemies chaining attacks together, it can and will become enraging.I haven't gone to NG+ or Enhanced Mode but from everything I've seen, it's not really worth it unless you want to achievement hunt, replay the game or try the harder difficulty. NG+ doesn't make the game harder but adds in new items. Enhanced makes it harder but the boss scaling is questionable; being able to be killed by them in 1-2 hits is personally not my style of 'enhancing' the difficulty.The enemies are, weird to say the least. Between some questionable placement, the many reused enemies, the PvE invasions that respawn when you rest even if you killed the invading NPCs and a few of the bosses that are infuriating because of some poor telegraphing, AoE spam from some bosses (Looking at you Successor of the Ribcage). Enemies could have had a fair amount more work added to them and they feel lackluster because of it.The story is what you expect; It's a cookie cutter anime story from the same people that brought you God-Eater. It's a decent story with some plot holes and some twists, some good and others terrible. It's a story that reminds me of those games or shows you watch, one that you turn your brain off and have some fun with because it isn't bad by any means but it isn't something to revel about either. The voice-acting is also what you expect; the people do a good job but it falls flat in some areas, not much else to be said.Visually, the game is nice and ran on my system quite well. Really don't know what else to put here since it runs smoothly and looks decent. Performance may vary between systems.The customization is decent as well. A lot of hairstyles to play with, some body sliders, lots of accessories which you can customize and some outfits you can change parts on. Most options have size, placement and a lot of colours to choose from. The best part is you can change most of your looks in-game at the hub area, so you're not limited to being the same looking person all the time.I'll close this by saying I had fun with the game, it was a nice game to play but it's cons are what pushed me away from it. I haven't tried out the DLCs since they dropped but looking at the very negative reviews on the two released at the time of this review, I won't be trying them. I've played a fair amount of souls-likes and FromSoft is my favourite games developer but, while this does a decent job at attempting souls-likes, the execution falls short.			"
Recommended,31.7,"																This game has some things to like and dislike about it. The general feeling is ""I wish I liked this more"". I'll point out some things I felt or noticed while playing itThe character customization is really incredible, but clothing and armor feels very limited. There's very few types of both and you can't really mish mash things to create some unique fashion soulsWhen it comes to character building, for some reason some souls-likes do this thing where strength builds are absolutely busted, there's a specific build that is hardly playable (in this game it's bayonets) and everything else is mid. The game's difficulty (and thus enjoyability) varies way too much depending on what weapon type you want to useThere are some maps that feel like a drag to explore or even just get by. Also, if you want to play the whole game in co-op with someone you'll have to play every map twice, it really is like dark souls huh. I really like the way coop plays but this alone makes it unenjoyable. Also, co-oping with NPCs shares the same problem with the builds, as there are some NPCs that are significantly stronger than others (Yakumo) As for the story, I like it. I don't think it's the game's main selling point but it's fineIn the end I think it's a good game to experience if you like dark souls and anime. I don't regret buying and playing it but the fact that it made me think about regretting it or not says something. I would advise against buying it if you want to do a co-op playthrough with someone unless you and your partner can enjoy each other's company without needing to do something together so the game just becomes a background for you. If you two need to feel actually engaged in something together to have fun it'll be fun and games for like 10 hours until you realize that you'll have to play Cathedral of the Sacred Blood twicetl;dr Mixed feelings. Some builds can feel severely underpowered and there are huge maze-ish maps, but it can surely be fun and cool at moments. Be careful if you're buying it for the coop			"

Recommended,22.3,"																Hi.This is a short-ish TL;DR Review of Code Vein with all of its DLCs.Base Game: Pretty decent story.Nice combat and aight enemies(They tend to be reused alot but eh,couldve been worse)Combat seems pretty nice and so are Gifts(Spells),Blood Codes unique and fun to play around with. Its easier Souls-Like game with Revive function.(I havent touched NG+ so bear with me on that).I personally beaten entire game with Bayonets,Cause Gun go Pew Pew while i blast a lost with FIREBALL to the face.Music is great BTW.Its REALLY good.DLCs: They all suck.Its a minor location with some reused enemies and mediocre bosses,outside of one which ill get to.Challenges for bosses are p good,outside last boss cause that is bad(ho boy is it bad).Hellfire Knight- Dragon Boy which seems ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but really pattern like,took me a bit to beat but man is he fun when you learn how to beat him,idk about his bloodcode if its good or not.Ice Empress- Kinda lame,Going from harsh but fair fight to lame easy fight.Just use fireball spells from base game to beat her.Lord of Thunder- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horrible ass wack ass boss. Big model which clusters your screen when you get too close,fight itself is wack too. He literally has attack where he runs around for 20 seconds and jumps at you,where all you can do is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wait. OH YEAH REMINDER BAYONETS GUNSHOTS DO ♥♥♥♥ ALL AGAINST HIM.Is Code Vein good game?Yeah id say its pretty good.Are DLCs are good for this game?No,Get First one and dont touch others.Game itself id give a solid 8\10. Or as my friend gave it Big Titty\1(Get Game Any time)DLCs are 3.5\10. Hellfire Knight alone carries these three DLCs to atleast 3.(Get em on sale only)			"

Recommended,43,"																I cannot recommend this, specially for people who likes soulsborne games since it's nowhere near the quality of the series.The Good:+ Waifus+ Zweihänder hits like a truck+ Some booses are good+ SoundtrackThe Bad:- Map Design. It's straight up trash. Apparently the devs thinks good map design is making very stupid mazes with lots of stairs. The patterns repeat the whole game and it's very f- boring.- Story/Lore. It's an anime-like story where all characters have had a sad life. It's just poorly written in all aspects.- Lots of useless cutscenes. Everytime you do something (get to a new area, find a 'bonfire', etc) there's a cutscene with loading time and literally no reason whatsoever to exist. The story is already bad, you sum this up and becomes a sh-tshow. I stopped watching all of them at some point.- Hitbox. Seriously. Garbage- Very dumb AIShould you play it? Nope, play DS1 again as Giantdad.			"
Recommended,41.6,"																Coming from Dark Souls: Remastered, it took me a little bit to become used to the combat style. At first, it felt clunky and odd, but after warming into it, it feels reactive and fair.Builds can be changed on the go, which is great for those who like to use it. I personally don't do this, so I'll instead do new playthrough for trying new builds.Level design is satisfying, and the landscapes and zones are all absolutely gorgeous. Compared to Dark Souls, it feels much more like I am playing a game, rather than being in the shoes of my character.As you likely know, the character creation is brilliant, and lots of fun.The atmosphere and feeling of the world is great, but the story that takes you through it is not too gripping, though it certainly has its moment.Holistically, the game feels like it fits somewhere between Nier: Automata and Dark Souls. If you enjoy the aesthetics, and Soulsborne games, I think you'll have a blast.I don't have any DLC because I hear they're poor value-for-money, but I'll likely grab the Season Pass if it goes on sale.			"
Recommended,3.4,"																I'm about 8 hours into this and I absolutely love it. I had to pull myself away from Surge 2, which I'm really enjoying, but I think I'll be sticking with this until I'm done.This is Dark souls meets God Eater, with a great anime/JRPG aesthetic/story. Anime tropes are toned down, which is nice, but they didn't skimp on dem tiddies. I can see why so many fake male feminist ""journalists"" are taking points off for the physics/attire... Bless you Japan.The story is really interesting, but the real draw is the combat, and the many ways you can approach enemies, and adjust your build. I didn't expect either to be so fleshed out. The extra development time really payed off.It's really easy to switch styles (Mage/Fighter etc..) on the fly, and each class tons of depth. The moves you can pull off/learn are really sweet, and there are tons of passive skills you can use in general, or to boost aspects of each class.I'm about 5 hours in, and have loved every minute of itThe only cons I have are some texture pop in (reminds of Mass Effect 1 on 360, though not as bad) and the samey God Eater/post apocalyptic settings early on. I tired to avoid too many spoilers of any kind, but I keep seeing thumbnails for different areas (one looks like Drangleic Castle). I just got to a cool place too, so I'm hopeful locations will be more variedI couldn't give a score until I complete it, but right now I'd say it's a must buy if you enjoy Dark Souls, Anime, or action JRPG's in general.One thing that was greatly annoying me more and more was the control layout. Light and heavy attacks are mapped to the X and Y buttons (I use a controller for these types of games). Now that I've switched things closer to Dark Souls, it plays a million times better.Along with your light and heavy attacks, you have 8 special attacks (called gifts) you map to the face buttons, and d-pad, which is activated by pulling/holding the right trigger (I switched it to left trigger). Some only work with certain weapons/classes, so it adds another layer of strategy/options. You feel like a total badass in thisFinal reviewI finished it last night and really enjoyed it, for the most part, took me about 35 hours. I'm a total ADHD case, so despite some issues, it kept me coming back for more until completion. That's the highest honour I can give to a game, I don't finish manyI give it a solid 8/8.5. For comparison to how I'd score other Soulsborne games; I give Demon's Souls, Darks Souls 1, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3 9.5's, maybe a 10 for Bloodborne. Dark Souls 2 gets a 9, mainly due to the DLC's.ProsCombatThe best aspect hands down. Options are very deep for character builds. It's easy to switch classes on the fly, so you never feel trapped. Skills aren't tied to classes once unlocked, but they can tied to weapon types, so there's even more flexibility.The base attacks are more floaty than Soulsborne games, but still feel satisfying. However, the vast amount of classes and skills you can acquire are where the game sets itself apart. It's almost overwhelming at first, but once you figure it out, it's complex, yet easy/quick to mess around with.There are 31 classes in total, with several unique skills in each. Again, once you acquire classes and unlock their skills, you don't have to use that class to use their skills.Equipping particular passive and active skills for weapon/playstyles makes all the difference, adding thousands points of damage at times, or preventing damage/improving healingBossesI love most of the bosses here. There are some really challenging and memorable ones. I don't want to spoil much (show one below) but you won't be disappointed. There's a checkpoint before every boss too, so you never have to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ run to the boss if/when you die.There are 18 bosses in the game (one is coupled with another, their Ornstein and Smough) I loved that fight, look up Blade Dancer and Canonneer.There are a lot of soft bosses too,  especially in their Chalice-like dungeons, but many are recycled enemies, still fun though.Exploration is always rewarded, so even though I didn't like the level design throughout, at least there plenty of goodies to find when you're trying to figure out where the ♥♥♥♥ you are.Character creationThe sky's the limit here for those concerned with the appearance of their character. It's one of the best in any RPG, something greatly lacking in Souls games IMO. I always try to roleplay myself, and make a male, but I wish I had gone the waifu route hereNeutral, or rather liked lessI liked the story at first, but the unskippable cutscenes for lore/world building started bothering me. In Most souls games, the story is told through item descriptions. They use memories here to flesh things out. It's a good idea on paper, and makes it unique, but sometimes you just want to get on with the killing.They have a great mechanic that lets you recall story elements, while you're bathing in a hot spring with the waifu's. If we were allowed to skip cutscenes, we could always find out what's going on this wayIt looks like this world is tied with God Eater, which has me excited for future offerings, but that's to be determined.The cast is great as well, but when you partner up, you'll grow to hate the NPC's at times, because they don't shut upEnemy variety is a bit lacking, but because everyone hits hard, and they give them different elemental attacks, it's interesting enough.ConsThe level design is very lacking at times, but there are some high points, and cool locations.It's the weakest part of the game IMO, which lowers the score. Every time they take a step forward, they take a step back with their maze fetish. There's a cathedral level that looks stunning at first, but like most levels, everything is nonsensical with poor landmarks. It's very easy to get lost, and I'm generally strong with directions/finding my way around 3d environmentsOne thing I love about the Soulsborne games is that despite their calamities, the environments all look like they could have been lived/worked in, for the most part, in the past. Here nothing ever looks like it could have been lived/worked in, outside the main hub/church, which is a cool location.It's not all bad though, and doesn't take away from how compelling this title is.

Recommended,47.9,"																So, a souls like game huh? But is it worth it?ii will be listing some of the pros and cons. now this is just my opinion of the game.PROS-character creation is really good, one of the best i have seen.-it has cute style and will appeal to anime fans.-it has a clear plot.-music is good but you might want to turn it down a bit.- it is a hard game for sure.CONS- Some of the animation (running, falling,etc) are really badly done, it looks like the character weights noting and can ""drift"" around the corners.-The maps are linear and rather boring, cant really be explored that much.-The enemies haven´t been that great either, little boring  with not much variables.-The story is meh, it feels little lackluster. you can unlock the characters tragic past. but i find it hard to care about them. - Lack of weapons and armor, and if you do find some they are basically just re skinned or re-colored of the same weapon with not unique moves.- Cant allocate your stat points, the game just does it for you. - If you want different build you need to change your core and that´s kinda stupid imo.- The skills are not so great either, just flashy moves but overall i find them little bland and cheap.- Not much item variety, just status effect things mostly, remove this, apply that, resist this, etc- Companions are too strong, and rather annoying with constant repeating dialogue.So, that all i suppose. if you decide to get this game i recommend to just flash trough the character creation and get to the actual game to see if you actually like it.but worry not you can customize your character later in the base.i hope this helps some of you and remember these are just things i liked/hated and might not apply to everyone. have a great a day :>			"

Recommended,58.2,"																I liked this game because I like Dark Souls, but I can't help but feel a lingering sense of disappointment after having beaten it. Let's me talk about why that is in three points. 1) The story. Boiled down to it's essence, it is a basic Dark Souls plot. There's a guy who sacrificed himself to prevent a calamity. That guy's sacrifice is running out, so you have to go collect four Lord Vessels, kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of the old sacrifice guy and then take his place as the new sacrifice person. Stretched over these basics is a fairly banal anime JRPG facade, but the fundamentals are essentially what they have always been. This thing could have pushed the limit a lot more with the tools it had. There are five companion characters who you have that all end up getting along with each other just fine. Why not have it so that they split apart ideologically? Why not make it so that three of them want to link the blood while the other people don't really want to? Why not make me choose a side? Then you could have even had a cool boss fight where you fight the people you didn't side with. That would have been rad, but alas no such luck. All you get from this thing is a set of endings that are dependent on how many doodads you managed to find during the game. It's dull and uninspired. Bleh. 2) The gameplay. I see many other reviews going on about how this game is easy, and it probably is. I mean, let's be real guys. If you've beaten all three Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro, then it might just be that you've gotten good at these kinds of games already. That said, I would say that I beat 80% of the bosses on the first go (including the last boss) and that none of them required more than 3 tries. The hardest parts of the game for me were the invasions where a horde of dudes would run at you in waves, and those instances don't happen often. For me it really boils down to this: If you're going to make having a companion be a fundamental part of your game, then why are so few of these bosses equipped to deal with two enemies? Why is it that almost every boss is vulnerable to the 'wait for them to aggro onto my companion and then duff them' strategy? In Dark Souls, there were those Dragon bosses or the Smelter Demon or that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fume Knight who could easily take on two or three players at once, but these guys just don't seem able to handle that level of difficulty. And I mean, there's only ONE real boss fight where it's 2 v 2 (and it happens to probably be the best boss fight in the game). WHY? Why would you not do double bosses more often in a game where you always have a companion? I just don't get it. 3) Character design. Let me first say that (hair clipping issues aside) this has the best character creator I've ever seen. A character creator where I can make a good looking brown person? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that is unprecedented. But character design in this game is a bit ridiculous to the point where it breaks immersion, particularly for the women. I am of the opinion that if you're going to put your main female character constantly showing off her boobs, then you need to give some sort of lore reason why she is doing so. Why is an adult woman walking around in a top that has a bunch of rips that show off underboob and such? Why doesn't she put a normal shirt on? And why is one of the shoulder straps on the other girl's battle miniskirt not pulled up properly? And why can't we give the girl in rags that we found on the street a pair of jeans? I get why fan service exists. I don't think it should go away. But come on, logic people. We all enjoyed seeing Kurisu in a maid outfit, but does that mean she should ALWAYS have been wearing it? Besides that, it felt like about 50% of the bosses were angry strippers. Dark Souls did that maybe 1-2 times per game guys. It stops being special if you do it all the time. Boobs are great and everything, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CONTROL YOURSELF. Anyhow. I did like the game... maybe I even liked it enough to get some of the DLC that will eventually come out. But it wasn't anything compared to any of the Souls games.			"

Recommended,177.9,"																Imagine Dark Souls with easier personalization of builds that are not stagnant throughout the game, with the ability to change to any archetype at a moment's notice, and bringing along 8 skills and 4 passives to personalize your custom playstyle.I like dark souls. I like sekiro. But I absolutely love Code Vein. Its personalization makes it easy for me to dabble into any build type without needing to grind out levels accordingly. Did I screw up a build? Let me just go back to another one without any hassle. The freedom of experimentation without any time penalties encourages players to learn/master skills and use them on any class. (With the exception of a few class unique skills).This mix-and-match element with customizable costumes and expanded color palettes for your armor makes this game feel fresh even while grinding. The flashy and faster combat is a welcome tempo change from the slower dark souls series, more akin to bloodborne and favouring aggressive playstyles.The build diversity is strong enough that there is no ""clear cut meta"" way of exploiting through the game. Though the general souls-borne rules of hitting once but hitting hard can carry you through most of the game without needing to dabble into skills. The game is also designed such that your companion AI can really help take the load off, and in some rare instances is a requirement because they balanced around it. Like dark souls, the multiplayer is quite finnicky as well, having to leave your ""summon sign"" in an area and wait for someone else in the same map area to ""summon"" you in to help. This can be a problem when there are multiple different areas and players take a while to find a buddy.I definitely recommend anime dark souls just because it encourages build diversity without having the player grind for stats on multiple characters, or having it restricted to needing to ""refresh"" your stats and skills every now and then when needing to swap. While lacking the kind of immersive atmosphere as expected from FromSoft titles, I am pleasantly enamoured by the anime waifus.			"
Recommended,82.2,"																Any dark souls fan will enjoy the combat and gameplay. Any JRPG fan will enjoy and scratch their head at the plot line.Been playing it with a friend and It's been a blast. Multiplayer, while very good, seems to have a bit of wonkiness. Player 2 seems to have a slightly different hit box then when you're playing Player 1. And there is no joint-game, so you basically have to do every area and boss twice if you're playing the whole game with a friend.			"

Recommended,64.2,"																One of the first souls-like games i've ever played. And even tho this game has it's weak moments, the story and gameplay was truly amazing. Pros:-♥♥♥♥ ton of customization options, from weapons, classes and abilities, blood veils to suprisingly good character creator,-Game encourages trying out new classes and changeing gear and playstyles, especially that you can change stuff on the go.-Really rewarding gameplay, there's high-risk dodgeroll melee backstabs, ranged combat with damaged dealing spells and heavy hitting hammers etc. -Coop partner on one hand probably reduces the difficulty but at the same time opens a lot of paths for builds and the game can allow itself to have more complex encounters since (if you didn't let your partner die), you should have somebody there to help you out if you get overwhelmed to save you from getting one shotted or take one enemies aggro,-Story is fantastic, didn't expect much from a souls-like, but man it was good, the memories you collect create really cool way to tell a story of different characters. -the level design is decent,-Io's boobs,Cons: -Level desing is sometimes confusing, it's not outright bad, the game has a lot of amazing looking places but there's some backtracking and again, confusion on some mapsAgain, not much experience in souls-likes, but i thought the game was really great.

Recommended,150.8,"																I like this game so much!Never mind my current play time, I have already finished this game multiple times on PS4.I am not one of those very technical players, but I enjoy trying out different builds and weapons, as you're not really limited to one, you can mix and match and change strategy accordingly.And you get a colorful cast of partners each with their different styles and personality, all very well voiced.What I really like though, is how much side stuff it offers besides what I personally consider solid gameplay. Character creation and costumization, various little activities you have at your base, conversing with the NPCs and learning their back stories. Giving them gifts and recieving ones. you can chill and listen to music, or you can sleep, it is just... very wholesome.I've played the OG Demon's Souls and Bloodborne, and while I enjoyed them, I never really felt very invested. The story in those two is obsecure and generally quite depressing. Which is perhaps a personal refrence, but I had an easier time getting into Code Vein.I bought this at launch on PS4, and I was pleasantly surprised as they kept adding stuff via free updates! Custumization items, a piano you can play, a pretty robust Photo Mode.That was pretty generous of them considering the state of the industry, and I was thinking about it as I played, this is will probably never happen again, as everything turns into live service. But I hope I am wrong.Like, little details here and there, shows obvious experience and/or listening to the community.They give you a training dummy to test your damage output. You wanna hide your cloak-jacket thingy? ok. NPCs talk too much while exploring? You can silence them... and many other conveniences.They even give you a hot spring area, which can be used to ""recall memories"" and watch cutscenes, or restore half your ""haze"" points if you die and decided to not go back and get it.So in conclusions, in comparison to other souls-borne/souls-like games, this one is kind of wholesome :) Also easier imo. On new game +, you get to choose if you want harder enemies. You can get multiple endings so you'll probably want to play multiple times.That about the base game. The 3 DLC maps in the season pass weren't very fun imo. The bosses are way too tanky, and to unlock the extra outfits for partners, you have to meet some ridiculous conditions.Get the season pass on sale if you must, and if you're up for a silly challenge.

Recommended,40.9,"																It's an ok game. It borrows much from the Souls games while using an anime style to it.The combat isn't as good IMO, the characters feel way too light, having no real weight behind each attack or equipment and it's super easy to land backstabs, just like in Dark Souls.The mask of the characters are blatantly put into the game so the dev don't need to animate them talking, which works fine in Dark Souls because the camera never gets a close up on the characters, but in this game there's much more story presented with the characters having no facial movement.It's fine for what it is, a budget souls game.			"
Recommended,16.5,"																Came for the characters, stayed for the gameplay. It's just a really fun game that gives a refreshing level of challenge, that makes the player use their brain for once, instead of relaying entirely on hit point numbers for false difficulty.The character customization is also plenty  fun, and gives the player plenty of freedom in stylizing their character with all kinds of accessories and outfits... Altough there is not much variety for the body types themselves. But still, great game.			"

It provides a very decent challenge so long as you go into the levels solo and not with an overpowered npc companon. NO it isnt as hard as dark souls but honestly who expected it to be? i didnt. If you like Dark Souls and jrpg games than u gonna like Code Vein. I must say my bar was originally set pretty low for this game and i am VERY happily suprised with how much enjoyment im gettin out of this.

Bosses felt more like a DPS race then actual encounters and toward the later half of me playing this game I started to find pretty basic and easy ways to abuse the combat system. I bought this on sale luckily and would encourage anyone that might be interested to do the same ( 20 dollars or less imo ). If there is one thing I can say that I was impressed by its that this game has one of the most, if not THE MOST customizable waifu character creator I've ever seen and well, uhhhhh thats pretty cool I guess.

Game is very accessible in my opinion towards different types of players, such as casual or the more hardcore crowd. For an easier experience, the companion is a great addition.For those who like a more challenged approach, the companion can be disabled and the game can be played solo. This is something that was not possible in the original Souls games (besides summoning at bosses).Some of my friends who would never touch Souls titles due to difficulty have picked this up since they feel like they can have a chance to beat the game.I hope your experience will be as good as mine was.

Go from point A to point B(boss),stop in between to save on the ''bonfires''. The exploration is on the weak side of this game. Cathedral sucks big time.Worst area in the game to get lost.-very low enemy variety too and recoloured enemies. The bosses arent as memorable as in Souls games unfortunately.-Side quests are pointless in this game except from 1 or 2 that give some backstory info.Pointless are also the fiew character dialog options.-The whole gifting system with the Npcs to give you presents is also pointless and never truely explained.-Graphic wise the game has a lot of low quality textures and the game performance isnt exactly greatSo overall for those of you that like Anime,Dark Souls and maybe God Eater this is recommended at a discount though,it isnt worth the full price.

Recommended,66.3,"																 Should've called it Dark Souls 4 It's hard to give a game like this a full ""yes"" or ""no"" as far as recommendation goes as it's a solid ""maybe."" Visually this game is spectacular. when you get out of the tutorial level, you're hit with a solid goth-noir atmosphere meeting interesting new characters along the way. all the levels have a unique vibrance with tailored asthetics to further you immersion traversing the post apocalyptic world. Gameplay on the other hand leaves something to be desired. Are you a meme-sheep who automatically gets hard over Dark Souls because the internet forced you to think it was good? if you said ""praise the sun,"" then this game is for you. If you got bent out of shape for that question, you've obviously never played Ninja Gaiden and have been brainwashed into thinking ""faulty programming = difficulty, LOL."" If you thought ""nah, Dark Souls created too much anxiety in my life,"" then stay away; because they literally copied and pasted the Souls source code for this game. it's not even that the game is particularly hard so-to-speak, you just take tons of damage for stupid reasons. Parry does not work at all (connected 1 out of 15 subsequent tries therefore impractical), dodging works about half the time because your invulnerability window is super tiny, and half the enemies' attacks smash right through your block. like, seriously don't put evasive countermeasures in your game if they're not going to be useful. It takes so long to use spells and items (leaving you vulnerable) that as soon as you get done healing you've already been pounded to death completely negating the point. Enemies do not stagger unless you build your character specifically to do so. You yourself will get staggered all day long usually resulting in getting stun-locked and pounded to death by combo heavy opponents or mobs. Enemy attacks also track to your position turning the enemy's entire body mid-animation to make sure they hit you regardless of you dodging (also why I said dodging only works half the time). So in the end, I want to say this is a good game but as usual, Bandai Namco still doesn't know how to make an action/adventure game and have obviously decided that they're just going to use Fromsoftware's 'Souls' code for everything now. visually it's God Eater inspired, but it looks like Dark Souls, it plays like Dark Souls, and leaves you screaming at your screen in frustration like Dark Souls.

Recommended,27,"																ANIME SOULS !Play it.==========Honestly, this game isn't bad at all, but it has some rather sizable flaws that prevent it from being truly ""great"" :- Hit boxes aren't super accurate to animations, leading to a great deal of enemies having more reach that you'd expect. In the Soulsborne genre, this is basically a cardinal sin.- Enemies can pivot at ludicrous angles, often making it seems like they cover 360° around them. This takes away the importance of careful positioning and sucks enjoyment of certain encounters. It should never be an issue in a game like this.- Backstab detection is inconsistent and janky.- The focus system feels underused.- The level design is wildly inconsistent. Some levels are pretty good, others are downright awful. This made me quit the game my first time around. Overall, they feel more like ""video game levels"" rather than real, lived in, areas.- The protagonist is like a ""self-insert"" character, this is the story of the Home Base gang before anything else.- This game is too much in love with particle effects, making the picture unnecessarily cluttered.- This came out in September 2019 but, on a technical level, is closer to Dark Souls 2.- The True Last Boss is a BIG FAT TURD that would make Elden Beast blush.- Projectiles fired by the bayonet rifle weapon class are painfully slow, making you question their viability as the military grade equipment the game present them as in the first place.			"
Recommended,73.1,"																I wish I could recommend this game.Code Vein is a souls-like game that doesn't know what it actually wants, ends up stretching itself thin while being bogged down by its cutscenes and walking sections.In its current state, I would rate it 6/10 on a good day. If they polished it more, changed several things and eased up on walking section it could have been 8 out of 10.That said, if you're infinitely patient and don't mind long cutscenes that drags on for so long that your controller turns itself off, and what you've seen of it appeals to you then it might be worth it to you.If you are not patient with cutscenes, AVOID.I had fun with it up till around the 10 hours mark, that's when the cracks started appearing to me.I'll give a brief summary and then into more detail below.The Good:- Decent character creator with room for creative minds- Music- Plenty of weapons, abilities, passives and blood veils (think armor) to pick between- Some of the environment looks gorgeous- Cool animations- Blood codes (this game's version of classes)- Likeable NPCsThe Meh:- Hair, body parts and clothing clip through each other- Companions that constantly talk while exploring (Recommend setting audio language to Japanese)- Enemy design- Backstabbing has animations that the game loves revelling in- Sound design- Combat- The Cooperation systemThe Ugly:- Walking sections (sometimes unskippable)- Long cutscenes that sometimes don't really serve much of a purpose- Awful level design in many cases- Bugs and glitchesBlood Codes, blood veils and levellingBlood codes is this game's name for classes, being the protagonist you are able to learn other blood codes and utilise them. This leaves room for a lot of freedom to mix and match as you please.Each blood code has different stats and bonuses. Stats are ranked from F to S+ and you can change these values with your blood code, blood veil and passives.When you max out the proficiency of a blood code's ability/passive, you can use that on a different blood code.As an example, I ended up using a blood code with high strength and vitality, and supplemented with passives that increased my mental stats so I could use certain buffs/abilities that would normally be unavailable to that blood code.As  you progress in the game, you have many opportunities to find other blood codes and their memories. More about that further down.Blood veils is the outer garb you'll be wearing when fighting and exploring. Just like your blood code, each veil type has different kinds of stat values, in addition to their own unique drain/backstab attack.Levelling is just ""insert haze to get more hp/stamina/damage/whatever"" and doesn't really change your actual stats.Haze is what you get from defeating enemies, experience points or souls if you will.CombatBecause of how most enemy encounters play out, you will in many cases have to fight more than one enemy at the same time. Sometimes it can be avoided by carefully luring one enemy at a time, other times it is completely unavoidable (like a boss fight or traps). So that means the moments you have to attack the enemies are precious, sadly because of how weapon animation works this puts a lot of limitations on you.When I started out playing, I wanted to be caster focused because I liked that idea. But the further I got into the game, the more frustrated I got because my melee attacks didn't do much damage and casting spells can often leave you very vulnerable. In addition if your attacks are weak, they won't interrupt the enemies attacks most of the time. Add in that you will have lower defences and health pool than someone who goes full tanky mode and big weapon. There are no shields in this game, instead you block with your weapon and depending on what weapon you have and upgrades, the block value will vary. So if you're playing a lighter attacker you will always lose health if you try to block, and if you screw up avoiding the attacks when attempting to dodge you get even more punished.If lighter weapons had the ability to interrupt their own attacks by rolling, I feel they would be more viable.The advantage of light weapons is better evasion, so avoid blocking if possible with them.I preferred using Zweihander personally.Sadly some attacks cannot be blocked even if you are facing the it. Examples being spells, aoe effects and things like the Ice Spears thrown by the dreaded Boreal Brutes. Ironically the hardest boss fight in the game is not against a named boss, it's against two Boreal Brutes that you encounter in a depths map. Boreal brutes are ""normal"" enemies, and against 1 of them is doable without too much frustration, against two however is suffering regardless of how you approach it.The environment, level design and endless corridors, backtracking and walkingMost of the environment found is somewhat bland and even repetitive. Doesn't help that the colours and brightness feel too saturated. There is one region called Cathedral, and it's just dreadful maze of a place. I have good orientation sense and memory, so I didn't get much lost but I can imagine for anyone else it would be straight up awful. Almost everything looks the same too, so you don't really have good landmarks to orientate yourself around.You'll also experience a lot of empty corridors, and they are basically ""hidden"" loading screens that you have to jog through. If it is one thing you'll be doing a lot in this game, it is running through these corridors.What makes it worse is that if you are a completionist that likes to find out and achieve as much as possible in the first run, this means you will have to return to previous areas a lot and backtrack to pick up items, talk to NPCs and fight quest monsters.This would be less of an issue if you could see in the teleport menu if there was something of interest in the region before going there. Recommend having this game on an SSD for that matter, I didn't and I guess I paid the price in time wasted.As for walking...As  you progress in the game, you have many opportunities to find memories of NPCs. These can be restored at your home base and will activate the dreaded walking sections. These are cutscenes that play out while you slowly walk (running is disabled), they can be skipped but if you want to know more about the world... I skipped little, but sometimes it just dragged on for too long and gives a ""PLEASE FEEL BAD FOR ME"" kind of vibe.There are certain parts of the story that will also trigger these walking sections, they are even worse and unavoidable.Code Vein really indulges in these cutscenes and it's just so tedious. There are better ways of exposition and almost anything would have been better than this.I would have much  preferred if they just played out like normal cutscenes with the ability for you to click to the next dialogue, so that if you get impatient you could just read the lines and click next to keep on reading.So instead of feeling empathy for a character, I just sat there bored and frustrated.The Rest- Performances issues in busy regions, probably had below 30 FPS at worst and changing settings did nothing- Directional input can sometimes be reversed temporarily in combat which is ???- Dialog options are irrelevantBide your time, wait for updates and sales. Maybe then it will be worth it.			"

Recommended,24,"																Code Vein is a somewhat fun to play Souls clone, though it has two major issues. One is that all player attacks/weapons have no real sense of weight to them, and the other is that the counter attack system is not very fun to use because there's a delay involved with it, so getting the timing right seems to require an excessive amount of practice.The game allows you to journey solo or with an AI companion. Multiplayer seems to work just like a Souls game, you can summon another player for an area but not for the entire game (as compared to say Remnant). When compared to Dark Souls the game looks nicer, but isn't really as fun. The game world is excessively linear. There is a nice weapon selection, but as I said, even weapons that do extreme amounts of damage won't stun enemies consistently. Your companion has neither infinite hp restores nor infinite ammunition/energy, so you'll constantly be looking for the next bonf- I mean crystal to restore hp/resources at. Unlike in Souls where most bosses are simple tank and spank who walk in a direct line toward the player, the bosses in Code Vein all have MMO-like mechanics to them.It's notable that while there are limited resources, you CAN restore some resources using your thorn (the counterattack mechanic I mentione dearlier). You can also steal HP from enemies using this thorn. If you can master the thorn, you can probably beat the game without needing to stop to reset the area using the crystals. I didn't master the thorn, however, and got annoyed as hell with it. It's notable that you can also use the thorn by charging it up and using it like a short-mid range projectile, this doesn't do as much damage or provide as many resources restored, but for scrubs like me it kind of works. Problem is if you try to thorn an enemy and it misses for whatever reason, you are left exposed as if you got parried in a Souls game.When the launch trailer came out I ended up laughing, because the first thing that came to mind is ""hey, it's an anime music video!"" complete with edgy music that you'd see in an AMV. But if you happen to like anime, then it's fine. I enjoy the art aesthetic, I think the music is nice, and the sound effects are good. I only did like two coop fights, and they seemed to be alright, but the game plays much nicer when you're playing it alone. Like not just performance, but not having your enemies become stronger due to more players. On a note, AI companions do not seem to make any effect on enemy strength, but your AI companion can save your life when you would otherwise die (not to mention the extra damage they provide, and they can tank enemies you're not fighting), so it's not suggested to play solo. Just like in Souls games when cooping your AI companion can and will die if they are overwhelmed or have to go too long without restoring their supplies. Just like me, they're just not very good at using their thorns.Two final nitpicks. One is that I hate the gas masks. It's such a lame aesthetic, so I recommend you look for the mod that makes gas masks invisible. And two .. this is not a vampire game. During marketing they kept calling it a vampire game, but there's no real vampires in the game. The closest you'll find to vampirism is the thorn.			"

Recommended,79.8,"																Personally i don't enjoy souls games. This one however ended up being a decent amount of fun. The anime artstyle is unique and really fits for this type of game.  The character creation is probably the greatest thing about this game. You can spend hours on it making your character look like however you want. The only downsides i had with the game is:The traversing in the cathedral of the sacred blood is an absolute hell. The map is completely useless for this level.The story is okay at best, I feel as though more time was put into making the game look great. It also baffles me that they made it possible for you to miss out on parts of the story. If you don't collect every ''blood code'' you'll end up missing a lot of context/backstory making the game seem like a confusing mess at times. Not a whole lot of variety when it comes to enemies you'll face on each map. Despite the flaws I'd say if you want to buy this game wait for it to go on sale don't pay full price.			"
Recommended,41.8,"																I like this game. It's not perfect no, however I feel like not enough people gave it an honest try. As a big anime fan I think the story was very well thought out and compelling where it needed to be .  It's combat system takes some getting used to and can be slightly frustrating at times but it's not so bad that the game is unplayable. Furthermore whilst I feel some of the bosses could definitely do with some fine tuning as it feels they just cycle through there different attacks in sequence, most of them still proved very challenging and were compelling in their respective roles. Each character has awesome development and are a joy to interact with. Lets not forget where this game shines particularly well, Character creation! I don't think I've ever seen so many different options available. The only place I'd say it may have been lacking a bit was with the clothing selections, and even then you have the option to decide which particular parts of each different clothing selection you want to be visible on your character! Another thing, Co-op, when it is available considering the current lack of players, is in my opinion better than in ANY Souls/Borne. They have the password system and everything and when in use makes your summons INSTANT, and  I mean INSTANT. Unfortunately with the lack of players finding help via summons w/o pass-code can take a minute but it's not impossible. All and all I really only have positive things to say about this delightfully under rated souls-like!I really think it gets a bad rep for no rational reason! I hope more people will give it a shot! I'm excited to dive into the DLC's tomorrow!			"

Recommended,37.4,"																Code Vein is a C tier average anime dark souls. It does some interesting things like giving you classes that you can change between that give you different abilities and such, but ultimately this game does what you'd expect a souls game to do but just painfully averagely. This game is more lovable for its insane levels of character creations. Its insane how much you can do with it, and you could create whoever or whatever you want. Absolutely amazing customization. Thats the biggest thing going for it though. The games good, what can I say.7.1/10 Code Vein is something to get if you like the concept of a C tier anime souls game. Its fun, just kinda average, and there is some annoying back tracking.			"
Recommended,65.7,"																The story is decent, albeit I did not find it 100% original, it has a similar theme to Bloodborne, which has released years earlier before the release of this game. No mouth animations during in-game dialogue, which is obviously weird. There are some plot holes, but not big enough to take away the focus from the main story. Gameplay:The game was designed to have 2 players take on the journey, human and AI or multiplayer with 2 player. The game is insanely hard to play alone, some bosses have bs attacks, which will make you end up seeing why Co-op partner has the ability to heal you. I wish it were more than 2 player though (In the offline mode) because npcs would show up on the battlescene in the cinematic but disappear in-game, certainly would've liked that extra help because as I said, some bosses are really BS, crazier than dark souls.The customization was arguably the best feature in the game, only downside is that your character doesn't use their voice almost at all during cinematics, and never in-game, except when you're dying, lol.Weapon variety is not as good as any Souls game, and levelling up is very linear.Design:The setting and atmosphere was cool, the mobs were plain looking. Did not like the sexualisation of some females, having a flat chest with giant breasts is just lazy fanservice delivery, absurdity.Content:The DLC is pathetic, just reskins of bosses and same movesets, I wish I had not bought the DLC. Dungeons have no end, not worth venturing through them because they are of the same quality of the DLC.TLDR;It's OK at best, at least it kind of scratches the SoulsBourne itch, 5/10			"

Something a bit more down to earth would be nice xD Everything is way over the top. But I at least have fun with exploration and enemy design.			"
Not Recommended,43.6,"																I really enjoy this game.  Yes, it uses the souls mechanic but it's a lot more forgiving than actual Souls games.  I love the aesthetic and the music is pretty damn good.  I enjoy the combat, mostly.  I like I can dodge easily in this game.  The stats being a combo of level, Blood Code, and equipment can take a little getting used to but I managed to find a code that fit my style fairly early and it carried me through to the end of the game the first time.However, it is so damn easy to get lost.  Some areas' color pallets really confused the hell out of me, and the map was semi-useless, especially in areas with lots of different vertical levels.  I wish you could zoom just a bit more or be able to move the map around at the level you're zoomed in.  I did have a better time once I turned off the mini-map spin but it was still frustrating.Also, I hate how enemies can stand on top of one another and how their attacks go through one another.  There's nothing quite like dying from a blast from something BEHIND the giant while you're fighting.  Also, some can teleport through the walls.  I know some of this is I got very used to in Remnant: From the Ashes where enemies couldn't phase through one another there was also a chance they'd actually hurt one another with their attacks.  The sudden two enemy boss fight really hammers home how infuriating this can be.  Also, the occassional homing attack that goes through cover, not a fan.Was also a bit frustrated how enemies hold their attacks for so long, then move and attack.  I'm so used to enemy 'tells' but most adapt after you have and it took awhile to get used to.The isn't to say I hated all the combat.  Some of the boss fights felt fantastic.  The mechanics were learnable and telegraphed reaonsably and even if challenging, I super enjoyed.  Queen's Knight being a particular favorite.I enjoyed having a companion.  I mostly favor Louis and Yakimo, they just seem to gel with my play style.The abilty to go back to home base and get half of your haze back is a god send, especially early on when I was still getting the hang of things.  I have not attempted to try multiplayer yet.All and all, I really enjoyed this game.  Yes, some things left me cursing up a storm but I'm about to start my third playthrough to go for yet another ending so I'm very much getting my monies' worth.			"
Recommended,49.7,"																Great game. I was surprised with how good the story is! It differs from Souls in that the story is directly told and unlike souls you are meant to play through it all with a partner. Though it has soulslike mechanics (and a lot of not so subtle references) the game isn't actually that hard until the ending levels where there's a massive difficulty spike. Great boss fights. Level design is great for the most part but some areas did feel kind of repetitive (another switch and ladder...?). Repetitiveness is its biggest flaw in fact- way too much enemy recycling and oh god the repetitive voice lines are so annoying. Very good story, solid level design for the most part, just needs some ironing out in a couple aspects. OST is average, graphics are decent for an anime style game. Speaking of anime, there's a lot of fanservice. Anime tiddies for dayz. Performance wise it's not hard to run, averaged around 80fps on my ROG G531GT. ---{Graphics}---[] You forget what reality is[] Beautiful[X] Good[] Decent[] Bad[] Don‘t look too long at it[] Paint.exe---{Gameplay}---[] Very good[] Good[X] It‘s just gameplay[] Mehh[] Starring at walls is better[] Just don‘t---{Audio}---[] Eargasm[] Very good[X] Good[] Not too bad[] Bad[] Earrape---{PC Requirements}---[] Check if you can run paint[] Potato[X]Decent[] Fast[] Rich boiiiiii[] Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulty}---[]Just press ‚A‘[] Easy[] Significant brain usage[] Average[X] Difficult[] Dark Souls---{Grind}---[] Nothing to grind[] Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks[X] Isnt necessary to progress[] Average grind level[] Too much grind[] You‘ll need a second life for grinding---{Story}---[] Story?[] Text or Audio floating around[] Average[] Good[X] Lovely[] It‘ll replace your life---{Game Time}---[] Long enough for a cup of coffee[] Short[X] Average[] Long[] To infinity and beyond---{Price}---[X] Worth the price[] Get it on sale[] Not recommended[] You could also just burn your money---{Bugs}---[X] Never heard of[] Minor bugs[] Can get annoying[] ARK: Survival Evolved[] The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs			"

Recommended,128.3,"																Middling Souls-like.  I got exactly what I expected.Combat is the typical fare of rolling, light attacking, and backstabbing but lacking Souls' polish.   The wide variety of classes and skills adds some variety but doesn't change the underlying formula.Mediocre level design that feels very 'video-gamey'.   There's little sense that the levels are part of a cohesive world - just corridors and rooms full of enemies until the abrupt boss fight.   Bosses are a high point.  They're varied and (mostly) mechanically solid.  I enjoyed the dramatic entrances and the over-the-top animations.   The NPC companion trivializes this part, but luckily can be disabled.I didn't pay any attention to the story.  Thankfully, the cutscenes are skip-able and the basic premise is simple enough to follow along without added context.  I don't feel like I missed much.Ultimately, I had a good time with Code Vein.  I got the good ending in about 27 hours and didn't feel much of desire to play any of the rehashed side content.   I'd liken the experience to eating an average pizza: it's not great, but you're full now, and hey, it's pizza.Edit: Co-op isn't great, either.  Your level is scaled down to match the host, but your gear isn't so you can 1-shot enemies and 2-shot bosses if you're further ahead.  On top of that, there's no lag compensation so dodging attacks can be nearly impossible if the connection is bad.			"
Recommended,27.7,"																Code Vein is great for both anime game and Soulsborne fans.The art style, character creator, and storyline will appeal to anime fans. And the gameplay is a great and fresh take on the soulsborne genre. I thought overall the game was great and well worth the money. I had a blast and completed first play through at around 30 hours of playtime (which in my opinion is the perfect length; not too long, not too short). I'll just sum up the good and the bad below. But I must say, if you've been trying to scratch that Dark Souls itch, this will definitely do it for you.1. Fluid BuildsUnlike other games, you aren't locked into one build (mage, tanky, etc). You can pick up and use whatever weapon or skill you want, if the weapon/skill is incompatible with your current blood code you can switch in seconds. It is a great feature, there are more than enough abilities and weapons to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Plus you can ""learn"" abilities so that you can use them in other blood codes if you find some favorites or want to make a custom build.2. Storyline The story is entertaining. Each of the endings are very unique, and they do a really cool story-telling technique using vestiges. These are memories of other characters that you can find and walk through to see things from other points of view or just see some history to a bunch of the characters. It was really fun collecting them and walking through them all (plus they unlock new abilities).3.GameplayIt's your classic soulsborne gameplay, stamina bar and all. It really excels in how much you can switch your build on the fly and how many different abilities there are (like I mentioned above). The one thing I wanted to mention is the AI companion. You can run around with many different companions as you progress through the story. Luckily, the AI is really well done and I found them only helpful, they never got in the way. And if you want a more classic souls experience, you can leave the companion at home and do it all solo.Overall I would highly recommend this game. There were 2 or 3 instances of noticeable slowdown, but it wasn't bad enough to get me killed or anything. Hopefully a future update addresses that, but it is nothing show stopping.			"

A good amount of content, with each boss and area being rather unique, although initially the ispiration from ds is quite apparent.Particularly nice the multiclassing mechanic, allowing for a varied gameplay that never bores, and the way the story is told through Vestiges.

Not Recommended,23.2,"																If you like adventure games that have a similar play-style to Dark Souls then you will likely enjoy the gameplay that this game has to offer. The game also has a great character customization and a decent plot. I think the art and the setting of the game are also strong selling points similar to what the Dark Souls games had to offer. There are plenty of different play styles and builds to toy with that will keep you trying new things to farm areas and kill bosses. Overall I'd say the game is a solid 8/10. It's not perfect. There are some clipping issues with the character customization options and the story might be a bit underwhelming for some people, but I think the pros greatly outweigh the cons making this a worthwhile purchase.			"
Recommended,53.7,"																I'm just going to flat out say it, THIS GAME IS A MEDIOCRE SOULS-LIKE GAME AT BEST.I'll start off by saying that about 80% of the games environment is the same as those explored previously in the the early game and the enemies are boringly the same as those you fought earlier on. The other problem I have with the game is Cathedral of the Sacred Blood. That place is a straight knock off of Lothric Castle from the DarkSouls series with so much confusion to its structure and so bland that it often felt like a chore trying to go through it. The gameplay on the other hand is what you'd expect from a souls-like game with a new ""gift"" system adding to it but with the same enemies you'd be fighting it gets rather boring. Not to mention that this game is way too easy as it gives you a companion throughout the whole game.The thing that I really liked about Darksouls series is that it never failed or downplayed their enemies/boss designs, they were always or for the most part spot on and don't get me started with it's environment. Sadly, this isn't the case for Code Vein which is why I can't recommend this game. Sure, if you're new to difficult games I'd say go for it to try and get the jest of it but for others, its not worth your time unless its for $10.			"

Recommended,58.8,"																I've heard researchers say there is no link between video games and violence. These people have clearly never played Code Vein. Never has a game filled me with such rage, with such hatred, with such contempt as Code vein. The designer of Code Vein, Yuta Yamamoto, rarely leaves his home without abodyguard. Identifying himself as ""the guy who made Code Vein"" usually ends with him being unceremoniously punched in the nose.Is this game great? No, maybe for the first 2 hours until you realise how much the game repeats itself, most of the levels have the same enemy just re-skinned, and sometimes even the exact same enemy. The bosses are trivial and not that interesting many of the bosses not even having a second stage. Now on to the good stuff, ""The Cathedral of Sacred Blood"", most possibly the worst level designed in video game history, this level is so repeating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying to navigate through, it uses the same textures throughout the whole, with the same 3 to 4 enemies appearing over and over again, Let me not mention that these think that they are on level of boss monsters, bombarding you with teleport attacks and some attacks only players with godlike reaction time are able to even comprehend. The map is confusing and doesn't help with navigation, without finding a guide online I would of found it impossible to locate loot that I have missed.Now onto the Boreal Brute, they're like bonewheels from Dark Souls if they were abducted and selectively bred with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Warhammer 40k space marines for the most hulking munted speed demonry, with each subsequent generation being baptized in more and more increasingly concentrated vats of radioactive monster energy drinks, these ♥♥♥♥♥ literally never stop attacking and their entire body is a hitbox, even their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ranged attack is an icy MOAB that cleaves your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half if you even happen to be occupying space somewhere on the same godamn continent.I hope you don't flame me for my review, but I would appreciate a discussion, to further increase my crippling depression.

Code vein is the biggest example of character creation and customisation done correctly.The companion sysyem takes off some of the heat and loneliness that comes with all soulsbourne games. Plus you can also send and attend to distress signals thats essentially co op. Thus Code Vein manages to deviate from the *Frustratingly difficult* makeup that defines this genre.A word about the story and the plot....again this is one area where Code Vein fares far better than the other games in this genre. Good storytelling, albeit with anime-ish tropes, sets this game apart. It also adds weight to your comoanions, giving you a window into their take on this world, the burdens they carry and how you tie into their aspirations for a better world.Without being too verbose,Code Vein has something to offer to every true gamer, from the casual story loving weeb, to the hardcore, game techie who wants to spend hours perfecting parry and backstabs. The characters ,unlike many game do not lack character.....and the story is engaging enough for Code Vein to be a strong title on its own.Loved this game. Will love it when the sequels come in :) Take a note,developers			"

Feels like some animation frames get skipped and later ones happen thus way sooner. especially annying if boss has a dash attack>Audio quality is good, OST itself is nothing outstanding. all area zones have same boring combat music which annoyed me more with time after timeConclusioni cant really recommend an ARPG with an edgy/clunky combat system.Either get this game if you want to play COOP with a friend or if you fancy some anime booba.If you want good ARPG gameplay AND surpass Code Vein in every aspect i mentioned get Hellpoint,Surge1/2, DS Series or Nioh 1 (maybe 2 aswell, didnt play that one) instead.

Recommended,51.5,"																It's a decent game, but the Surge 2 was a more favourable Souls-like for me.There's more customisation of abilities, and actual abilities in general, and that's a very strong point for this game.However, despite the character customiser being excellent, I had a lot of problems with the RPG elements of this game. For it being a Souls-like, I found it:- Lacking different gear types - armour sets were sorely missed as well as buffed accessories.- Lacking in weapons. I'm up a fair way into the game and I feel like my arsenal is pretty small. Although trading valuables to NPCs and matching their favourites in order to maximise points and get their weapons is a nice thing (also something I really loved about the rep system in Dragon Age 1).Other than abilities, the combat is average and not entirely satisfactory. The melee combat is sluggish and I found there to be a few annoyances with the lock-on system and the dodge mechanics overall. Your character doesn't turn and face when a new target is auto-selected, which I found I really appreciated in the Surge 2 as you balance staggers on multiple enemies that way. With that in mind, the Surge 2 ONLY had melee combat (c'mon drone isn't much) and that had to be perfect, wheras the mediocre combat is Code Vein is almost made up for by the abilities. Leaping into the fray, smacking down huge combos and throwing ice bolts as quick finishers was very fun.One thing I detest about this game though is the unskippable unpausable snorefest that it drags you through. The memories. FML. Overall if you REALLY like anime it's a good game, but it isn't really a good souls game, which is what I perceive it to be.			"

Recommended,49.8,"																This game is one of the dumbest things I've ever experienced. When is the sequel?_________________________________________________________There are a lot of other reviews that cover most of what I'd say, so I'll get into the things I liked about this game. It offers a souls-like experience with way more flexibility than the other games in that style that I've tried. Don't like your character class? Change it whenever you want. Don't like your abilities? Unlock other ones and put together the whackiest build you can think of. Is the game too easy? Play it solo without a companion. Is the game too hard? Play it with the AI companion. Is it still too hard? Play it with a companion and a friend. The level of control you have over your experience is very refreshing in this game, and there is never a point where you are stuck in a certain playstyle or tactic. That's the main thing I liked about CV.This game is dumb, cheesy, completely un-self-aware, has some really questionable design choices (looking at that one pole-dancing salamander hatsune miku boss as an example), and it's excessively anime-y (like there is an early 2010s level AMV midway through the game). But underneath all that is a fun souls-like that really puts you in control of how you get beaten down by its brutal bosses. I give it 7/10 onigiri that you eat even though you don't need to eat them because you're a vampire, but they remind you of your anime cat-girlfriend so you're gonna do it anyways.			"

Nobody but the host can interact with objects or doors. You are effectively an Invader in Elden Ring. The little I played of this game until we found that out proved that the gameplay is over-complicated and padded with a billion different buffs/debuffs/items/abilities, the controls are unintuitive, and the story is overshadowed with how obnoxiously bad the English voice acting is.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER.

Recommended,43.7,"																Code Vein is a JRPG at heart. And as such is driven by a carefully unwinding story with a dark theme akin to a Soulsborne game. The music is relatively good except for the alert tune which cuts in and out periodically that makes me want to die. My favorite boss in the game,  Successor of the Throat  might have had a long run up but the moderate anger festering up was almost a livid excitement when I entered the final walk area quite a few times to the gradual buildup of the tune as you approach into the boss arena. I also like the reattempt at an Ornstein and Smough sort of boss gank, sadly the only one in the game, however I think the difficulty factor was cranked up way too high. To be honest I didn't know how online play worked till I got to the last form of the final boss that simply seemed unbeatable even with the best gear I could find(of which I have yet to acquire all of the equipment in the game for builds) and sadly there is no PVP, truly tragic as I think this game is only gonna last a bit over 120 hours in the long haul(assuming DLC extensions) and is not gonna be anywhere near the level of replayability of a mainline Souls title. And the cherry on top of it all is the relatively creative character customization, while it is lacking in a lot of slider freedom and the faces are all presets (no ugly monster faces boo) the attachments system is a really cool idea for personalizing your character and even made an abyss watcher waifu cosplay possible, though I wish there was a way to extend the number of points you are limited to on attachments that was fairly integrated in the game (like every ng+ you could get an extra 4 points in customization). On top of this I wish there was more variations of weapon types, for example one handed swords. There is a grand total of one rapier in the game that I found. A lot of the customized ""special"" weapons NPCs use are just reskins of another weapon that could have been made with much more striking or unique models with altered movesets. The number of unique movesets seems to be only at around 12 not including magic skills on the boss weapons.Now on to the bad, I have never had to reattempt the butterfly dragon moth boss, unacceptable in a souls game. This is mainly due to the game somewhat babysitting you with the ability to constantly carry a companion around that constantly banters with you and constantly taunts you after dying to a boss that makes you frustrated enough to see if there is a way to kill the companion by throwing them off a ledge. And the worst (but acceptable) part is that the companion can occasionally revive you immediately when you die but their AI is pretty random and aggressive to the point where a companion can die quite quickly and leave you hanging. They try to balance this revival mechanic by making it cost health to heal another companion. Which brings us to an irritating issue, that the estus flasks are just not strong enough to make playing solo possible for a significant portion of the game, you have at maximum 10 uses and at the max regen level appears to recover about 35% of your HP on an average build at level 120. And since every single boss aside from the butterfly moth dragon thing has the ability to straight up one shot, or one cycle combo, a moderately armored player it simply feels reckless to go into a fight when every boss was clearly designed to be taken on in a pair. I honestly am not even certain if the hit points of a boss scale with the number of teammates you have like in other souls games but most of the time in mid game it felt as if I was hitting bosses with a wet noodle until you buffed the weapon, stacking multiple kinds of buffs and debuffs to take advantage of gaps to strike. Another problem is that almost every boss can be staggered in some way after a certain amount of hits where they randomly convulse while kneeling. This could be fine for some bosses or if you took advantage of some weakness to initiate it. It makes these opportunities too long and are usually followed up with some kind of instakill self-immolation that usually kills your partner on low health with their stupidly aggressive AI. Another gripe I have is how open ended the start of the game was. Somehow I made it to the -insert swamp meme here- level with thicc rolling as my second dungeon when the intended player path was obviously to go first to the moth as the second boss and left me severely under prepared for the  Invading Executioner  and essentially allowed me to cheese the moth fight to trivial levels. Lastly, the level of copy and pasting enemies from the early game into later game levels without even bothering to at least retexture them is simply lazy and obvious padding, so much that even one of the characters makes a comment about the enemies wearing winter camo on the ice level when they simply look like the same basic enemies from the tutorial area and immediately caused severe internal brain damage. And lastly they try to pull the same power of friendship trope every weeb can appreciate up until the end of the tragically easy third to last boss that had so much hype building up to it for the fight to be as despicable as the villain portrayed up until the battle.I would ultimately recommend, waiting at least until the DLC(s) release to come to the decision to purchase. Even then consider picking the game up on sale as the PVP scene is non-existent and the number of players willing to activate summons seems quite low, at least on North America. There is not much reason to immediately pick up the game now for 80 bucks aside from instant gratification.			"

You could spend hundreds of hours just making characters. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone wanting to try out a souls like game. If you don't like dying a bunch though I'd give it a pass.			"
Recommended,12,"																I am only giving this game a negative review because of the price. The game is a fun and has a interesting story. The combat feels very eh, you can back stab any small enemy effortlessly. Majority of the bosses are somewhat of a challenge, just got to learn their attacks. Honestly the first few bosses were the hardest do to learning the game and not having good gear. The game feels very short and the areas don't have any depth to them. They are either progressing forward or a dead end path with an item. I have played all of the other Bandai Namco Souls like games and enjoyed them very much. This game to me felt like a good introduction to the souls like series. The game was a lot easier then any of the souls games out there. Not having the choice to leveling individual stats, made it feel like it didn't matter what your build was. You could for the most part with a passive boost could use most abilities. The game lacks a lot of content, you beat an area which doesn't take very long. Then you can revisit it to sometimes do side quests. The side quests though are very short and honestly pretty stupid. They don't offer great rewards, and none of them offered anymore challenge or decent content. So overall it was a fun experience, I enjoyed the story, and the few challenges this game has. I feel personally after being delayed for 2 years, it didn't have a ton to offer. This game could have great potential, but at the moment it is not worth $60. You could beat the game and play it on a harder difficulty or start a new character, with hope to play a different build, but not much will change. Wait for it to go on sale or see when the dlc comes out if it adds more content.			"

Not Recommended,13.5,"																I was really disappointed in this game. The character creation is easily the best part, and I absolutely love the anime aesthetic, but that's all it really has to offer. I love anime, and I love Dark Souls, so I thought I'd like this game, even if it had some flaws, but it let me down. The game is incredibly bland and repetitive--it's boring. Really freaking boring. And soulless. The combat is meh, but the environments are often recycled and reused so massive portions of the game feel the same as other parts, and there's not very many enemy types so it just felt like I was fighting against the same couple of baddies over and over again. Then there's the really bland level design--for example there's these mini bosses you can fight in each area, and each mini boss is just a slightly altered version of the same enemy, so each of these mini boss fights is basically the same, and each of the ""arenas"" is just a flat square. Every arena is basically just a perfect square and a flat platform. The combat feels kinda janky and there's a lot of bloated game mechanics that really have no business being in a game like this. There are so many things that the game has that are awesome on paper but executed lazily. I didn't finish the game but from what I saw, the writing was alright and there were some good cut scenes, and seeing the character you spent 2 hours making in these cut scenes was great, and the hub area was pretty decent, but the gameplay is just boring and soulless. The game has all of these cool quirks like changing the music in your hub area, online co-op, etc., but these quirks don't fix the boring combat, repetitive waves of boring enemies or boring and lazy level design. It's just not a fun game after the thrill of starting it, almost everything you do feels like a chore. I feel like most of the people that praise this game love the idea of it and not the game itself.			"

Recommended,20.7,"																To be specific I received this product free from a friend of mine, not as a review copy or code.TL;DR Game can be easier or harder based on decisions you make on progression, recommended for players looking for something middling to intense in challenge.In addition this game is a very smooth ride and beginner friendly Souls like. This is mainly because of a feature the game touts and that is the partner system. While traveling through the game you can pick one of many teammates to assist you on your way. If you'd like a considerably harder game that is arguably harder than the man souls franchise, turn off partners, and go for the bad ending. The enemy counts appear to be much higher (Can't say for certain as this is the only souls like I have completed) than your typical souls game.If you are looking for a much easier experience, play with Yakumo in the early game, dude can stun lock just about everyone, and  go for the good ending.Some parts of the game will test your patience, others may feel a little too easy if you're using partners. However I still recommend the title because as someone who couldn't play souls games before, I really got into this title, granted I had someone watching me early on to assist me and point me the right way, but I did not consult guides for specifics, good old bashing my face against the wall until I broke through.			"
Recommended,41.3,"																After playing almost 40 hours I think I can give this a fair examination; first and foremost the character creation is one of the best I Have seen in quite a while. The characters each have there own back story in this epic tale; to which its up to you to find these memories to truly appreciate the depth they gave to each of them. Now the combat is a little clunky not going to lie; however with so many options to create your own fighting style from 100 Abilities from many classes. You can mix and match to suit your play style and what best suits your situation. Texture variation is a little repetitive; each zone does however offer a different feel with some new enemies and challenges to overcome. Graphics overall are impressive with many options to improve the look and tweak performance to your liking; whether you running it on a NASA Computer or Potato. Multiplayer is a bit of a joke at the moment; matchmaking is a little off and you can get d/c'd before even joining the host. They do need to fix these network issues and perhaps improve upon the framework of multiplayer i.e where you can play; It currently follows a Dark souls method of certain areas only.In conclusion with some short comings on Multiplayer combat mechanics; it is however saved by the great story all be it a little short. With future content in the season pass I look forward to seeing what Code Vein can bring to the masses.So i cautiously give this title a strong and impressive 7/10... Good start but needs some improvements to standout from the overcrowded genre.			"

Recommended,2.5,"																This is good game, there are only 2 problems I have with it. Minor problems, but they are annoying when you think about it. Also calling it Souls-like might be a stretch since you've got a friend that can kick ass and help you out. But I guess you can go though the game without one and make it more difficult, but I'm not sure. It's still a good game, if this is on sale, get it.One: There is just one map that really suck to go through near the end. I can find my way around almost any map and have a good idea of where I am and where I need to go, but this one just sucked, really complicated with multiple layers. If the in-game map was 3D or better showed differences in height it wouldn't be an issue. There was another complex level earlier on with a lot of layers and a lot larger that I thought they did a good job on.Two: Kinda of a spoiler, so be warned, but the way the locking on to a target and the way the camera interacts was awful for the final boss. I had to lock and unlock off the boss so I could see what was coming and be able to dodge attacks with out dodging back into them. All the other bosses and enemies were fine, it was just the last boss were this fell apart.			"

Recommended,73,"																10/10 Core Game.Do you like the God Eater series? Do you like the Dark Souls series? if you answered yes to either of these then you will most likely enjoy Code Vein. The game has a great story, more than one ending, tons of gear for you to find, plenty of viable builds to suit most play styles and has replayability. Co-op is about what you would expect in Souls, with the exception that there's no need for a summon sign. All in all, a great game. Worth every penny.9/10 DLC Content.About the DLC content. I disagree with the majority of the negative reviews, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.The DLC's are worth the money you spend for them. You get new bosses with each of them, and they're at the difficulty par I'd hope for a DLC boss (downloaded the DLC's during NG+ and fighting them at level 200+ they're hard enough i haven't beat a single one of them in hours of attempts) The goodies you attain from meeting the trials goals are nice, and it gives you something to shoot for. Goals are always nice to have. Aesthetically I really appreciated the Hoarfrost map, but they all have their own appeal. The boss design is great if you're a fan of the God Eater series, you'll get vibes. Honestly that makes me pleased because when you play the core game and Deus Pita shows up in the cutscene (God Eater series Aragami) it made me wish i could fight some of the Aragami in Code Vein, the DLC essentially gives you that option.P.S.Don't let my hours played fool you, I've spent most of my time playing offline due to not having internet for a few years.

If you want a game for story, look elsewhere, if you want something that has fun gameplay, again, elsewhere.\For the time and effort this game wants you to put into it, there feels to be almost zero reward. For the actual gameplay, you have stats that can be altered by gear and 'blood codes', these will affect the 6 choices of weaponry you have, plus the light/dark spells damage output, but ultimately this does not matter as regardless of your level, enemies and bosses will scale with you. When it comes to level design i'm positive the design team made the first three areas then just reskinned textures and enemies and said: that'll do for the next 12 stages, except as you progress level design goes from being boring and tedious, to just outright unfair. Pitfalls with no way distinguishable difference to surroundings, wall traps with no way around other than just tanking the damage, enemies designed just to push you into the never-ending pitfalls. As you progress you will find the level will have only one spawn point, being at the start, nothing that bad, except now when you challenge the poorly designed boss and get killed by their completely unavoidable attacks, you now have to spend 5 minutes getting back there, and no damn well this will be a recurring pattern in the second half of the games because the developers don't know the difference between challenging and stupidly un-finished gameplay.

Recommended,46.7,"																If you like dark souls then pick this up. It can be very challenging and the gameplay is where it's at. The biggest difference is that Code Vein has a lot of skills to unlock and most likely you won't master everything unless you are farming and not progressing which I don't recommend. You can bring 8 active skills and 4 passive skills along with your items. For some reason the game says the keys are mapped to F1-F8 keys even though they aren't or don't have to be. It was very confusing to me until I checked the configuration. There doesn't seem to be a way in game to correctly show the correct keys but essentially F1 can be 1, F8 = 8 so if you remember them you can easily hotkey your skills in combat. I have a gaming mouse so it was very easy for me to get past this but I'm sure not everyone has one. May need to map it to other keyboard keys then but you basically can't use the UI to really help you remember.The story was okay but some of the cutscenes (vestiges) felt short and underwhelming but I loved the backstory overall for the world. The ending was magical af but it's anime. The voice acting was good with the option of Japanese language and there is a ton of dialogue even in areas of exploration. In fact I would talk to everyone every time. They might have something new to say. I actually had to bite the bullet and bring a NPC with me on my journey because I would be missing out on dialogue. Sometimes it feels like bringing a second person feels cheap but that's the accessibility everyone always wants right? I will definitely go solo on my second play through. My first play through took about 46 hours in 6 days and that's with searching every nook and cranny for the true ending. For $60 bucks I thought it was alright. I was worried it would only be a 20 hour game but the game has a lot of areas. I would be interested in watching a speed run of this. Most of the boss fights were kinda meh but the really tough fights are really fun. I wouldn't say the co-op is worth mentioning in this game because you'll have to keep resummoning people every time you have to rest at a mistle/bonfire. So it's not truly co-op like borderlands or something. Kinda of a weird implementation that I hope will be patched in the future especially if there are DLCs or sequels in the works.			"

Recommended,120.8,"																Tentative recommendation from me. It's good/has a lot going for it, but could really stand for some improvement especially with the level and enemy design both of which start to feel very repetitive after some time. There's also the animation, which is quite janky and awkward in a lot of places. I found it endearing in a way that overall improved my time with the game, but I can also imagine it being a put off for someone who really cares about that sort of thing. All that aside, the game is fun. The moment to moment combat is nice and slick and there are enough options that it can be fun to mess around with, the environments are just cool enough aesthetically that it almost made me forget how samey the actual level design was, the story is ridiculous in the best way possible (it's very lore heavy and hyper-emotional in that way that anime often can be), and, of course, the character creator is the perfect 'build-your-own-anime-hot-topic-big-sword-fighter-person' that I personally always dreamed of having as a dumb teen. I hope the devs get another stab at a game like this so they can iron out the weird kinks. There is a perfect game in here somewhere, I feel.Also the companions constantly bark their thoughts at you. Doesn't matter what you do, be it pick up an item, spot an enemy, run up a hill, whatever it is they will let you know their thoughts on it. Some people find this annoying but I thought it was cute. It's like when a puppy brings you an old shoe, or something.			"

Recommended,18.5,"																Game crashed and I lost about a hour of progress. Does not autosave in the same manner as the games it tries so desperately to emulate do (Dark Souls). Map designer should never work in this industry again. I can't use the gear I want to use, because the leveling system does not allow you to choose what stats to raise. Leveling only raises your HP, Stamina and physical damage output.Thus you're purely stuck to a certain build if you want to wear a certain piece of armor. Find a really cool cloak that has stats which would benefit your strength build? Well, you wont be able to wear it since you're missing the one stat (For example, willpower D+) which you can only get from either gear or blood code whatever the hell it's called, which essentially is the build/stat system the game is based around of. So to wear that cloak, you'd  have to abandon your entire strength build and choose a different build and style of play. I have worn the same armor set for the past 10 hours of gameplay, even tho' I have picked up and bought a ton of other sets, because their required stats are for different builds. Due to my build, my Strength is S-rank even without any bonuses from the armor system, but I can't wear any of the new armor I pick up because they all require some stupid stat like Willpower C or Mind D+ etc. etc.Story is your basic, ""friendship is magic uguu OwO you don't have to walk alone when you have me with you!!!11!"" anime garbage we have seen time and time and time again, just in a different setting. It's absurd this level of writing is still considered passable in any media. Other than that it's pretty fun.			"

Recommended,99.2,"																I really enjoyed this game, and after completing my first playthrough, here are my main thoughts:This game follows a similar style to the Souls games from From Software, with some differences. Some bad, some good.Starting by the negative points this game has:- Your character, while being the main hero of the story, has absolutely no agency in it. And yes, I understand that not all games need to have branching storylines where choices matter a lot. But apart from fighting, you're rarely invited to give any input to the game. Each time there's a dialogue choice it feels like the two possible answers are two ways of saying the same thing: ""Yes, you did good"" vs ""Yes, you weren't bad at all"" or something like that.- Speaking of dialogue, during character creation you choose a voice type, seems like you'll hear you character speaking right? NO, your character has literally two lines of speech. You hear more sentences coming out of their mouth during character creation while trying the voices than for the whole campaign. This feeds into my previous point. In Bloodborne and Dark Souls games your character doesn't speak either, but you don't have tons of cutscenes with characters talking with you while you nod in response or just look at them with a blank look.This was my main gripe with the game, adding the fact that some of the enemies feel like recycled versions of previous enemies, but that didn't bother me too much.On to the positive stuff:- The story, while not super mind-blowing nor with some allucinating twists, held its own, and keeps you with a sense of direction for the full duration of the game. That, to me, is a plus. The story is presented gradually and in a digestible way.- The characters that accompany you are likeable and all of them have at least a decent amount of backstory attached to them, that you can choose to dive into or not. - The combat system feels fluid, you feel the hits landing, and isn't clunky which is fundamental for this type of games. The backstabs are a bit weird, but you get used to them with time.- The build variety is huge. You can seriously build your character with so many different skills (gifts) both passive and active, as to keep the game fresh and with a constant feeling of progression. Also, you can change your build and your archetype (Blood Code) at any point in time, even during a boss fight, which gives you immense flexibility. This offers immense replayability. - Also, pretty much every weapon is viable, and it ultimately comes down to playstyle. So choose what you prefer, not what you see people mention in forums as OP.Ultimately, I reccomend this game, particularly if you get it on sale. You can play with or without a companion. I felt like the game is designed to be played with a companion, as otherwise some areas/fights would be straight up bullsh*t. And if you play with a companion, the game feels easier than Dark Souls and Bloodborne. If you play solo (which I did not in my first playthrough) then some parts will feel harder. Not because of the enemy design, but simply because of their numbers.			"

Not Recommended,5.9,"																Important Edit: Go to your AI companion and tell them to stay behind, you will enjoy the game significantly more. Significantly improves the difficulty as well as makes for more intense fights. I'm a touch farther into the game and I am still greatly enjoying it. So far I am genuinely impressed with Code Vein. Character customization is INTENSE, and the overall feel of combat once you adjust is pretty nice, especially once you get the hang of unlocking skills for specific weapons and using your Blood Veil. It definitely wears it's Dark Souls inspiration on its sleeve, but I feel like it has enough going for it to stand on its own as a fun JARPG. If I had to describe this game to another Dark Souls fan, I would say it's essentially a Souls-like with anime visuals that makes you feel like you're on an absolute power trip, because your character feels like an absolute badass. Not to mention I really do enjoy the world's aesthetic... But I've only seen the first few areas. Once I'm done with this one I'll return and post a final opinion, but for now it definitely exceeds my expectations (especially after seeing some less-than-glowing reviews from some certain ""journalists"") and I find it to be quite enjoyable.

Recommended,7.9,"																Quite à mediocre ""souls-like"".Pros- Character creation is ok- Some nice soundtrack- The Blood Codes mechanic is really cool- A few bosses have very good designsCons- Ugly, uninspired levels- Repetitive boring enemies - The Cathedral level : should make every dev involved in this ""thing"" feel bad, and I wish for them to step on a lego ; this level is a labyrinth made of only 6 different assets, you'll get lost in that white hell for hours and you'll hate the game for that. Everything looks alike, you'll just go crazy.- Frequent FPS drop for absolutely no reason other than bad optimization- Some special attacks just don't work, or only half of the time (like the double sweep from Yakumo's Blood Code most often goes through enemies without hurting them)- Invasion mechanic can just go f-k themselves (it's basically just a ""horde mode"" but the game is very bad at handling group fights and you'll get kill over and over because every enemy is going to attack with a different rythm. Roll to dodge one, get hit by its buddy after i-frames end)- Some very, very bad level design and mechanics (a lot of backtracking for no good reason, or that one in the snow level where the ground just opens up under you and you fall, and you have zero chance of finding where its going to happen). - Your healing items are worth nothing. Even after +5 upgrade, it still doesn't heal for more than 20% of your total life. Enemies can do 50%+ damage to your life bar and after one bad encounter you'll be out of healing. - Not a problem Code Vein is the only one to have, but staggering combos from enemies is just something I hate with a passion. Getting hit ONCE is sometimes all it takes for you to die, because after that you can't block or evade. At least in Ni-Oh 2 if you get staggered, you can actually block to save your life. Here, you'll just die. And some enemies have crazy staggering power, like those capoeira b-stards.tl;dr : just a boring Dark-Souls rip off with big tiddies anime girls, and crazy awful level design.			"
Recommended,38.1,"																If this review stops even one person from wasting their time on this painfully uninspired piece of dreck, it will have been worth it.None of the mechanics mesh, difficulty spikes are beyond insane, accessibility of worthwhile items even if you have limitless cash is zero. Most of all, though, the environments are terrible. There's generic underground, generic street, bog with 5ft visibility, and the all white ""cathedral"" maze that's the same blurry 2kb texture repeated over and over for over an hour. Your reward at the end of this is to be thrown into a ridiculously extended flashback sequence in generic street (but now slightly darker) with no warning, separating you from all the characters you've come to tolerate and maybe even found one to care about in order to be led by the nose while the game dolls out the same cheap enemies in the same terrible environments and tosses exposition at you pertaining to the least interesting story in the history of ever.Also, it takes 13 hours before you finally see ONE female character who isn't hyper-sexualized within an inch of their life (despite the fact that half of them are supposed to be sub-18) and the game has exactly 3 music tracks - all of which are horrible.Just.

Recommended,60.7,"																This might be the worst Soul-like game I've ever played. Nonetheless, the game itself still contains some interesting points though. To be honest, I don't recommend this game at all despite the pros it has as the flaws are way too much for me, but you can go for it when it on sale if want to give it a try since it still worth for a single or two runs, just don't go for the 100% completion because it's tedious as hell.Pros-Amazing soundtracks, literally one of the best for Soul-like. (Especially those songs that have vocal)-Very interesting story.-Cutscenes are pretty nice, they can portray emotions quite well despite the facts that their a bit stiff models.-Many famous JP voice actors are here, so the quality of the JP voicing is awesome and able to keep up with the expectation.Cons-The combat systems is the worst part of this game. (Hit boxes, animations speed, damages are seems unbalanced for me, but they're still good enough to complete the game thought)-The scaling of this game is a bit unrefined, some enemies will suddenly become harder when player reached a specific part of the game (aka. church of blood).-NG+ scaling also unbalanced for enjoyment. The early game difficulty is fine for me, but right after I reached church of blood the enemies started to become way too tanky compare to the amount of them and completely ruined my NG+ experiences.-The length of maps is unreal, they're way too long and complex for what they could be. (Too many unnecessary corner, straight way, and hole.) FYI, I'm playing a Soul-like game, not a maze runner simulator.Ps. If you think this game is a wonderful Soul-like game, then I strongly suggest you to try out Sekiro, Elden Ring, or Dark Souls 3.

Recommended,67.1,"																Honestly yeah, this game is pretty much anime Dark Souls. Down to the basics at least, so it's easy to pick up for those interested, although the controls are different. The advanced stuff and story is more what sets it apart and gives it a feeling of difference. It's not something I'd ever consider GOTY from a story standpoint, but it's still a pretty nice story. Of course the good sides and bad sides must be brought up.Pros:Easy getting into it, tutorial will teach things quick and it is just plain skippable if you'd rather learn through playing.The best ending is actually not that tough to get since it rewards looking around and gathering stuff within each location. Rewarded for giving yourself more options in combat and just learning more lore of the world and people.Music is pretty great, honestly the lead up to one boss has this amazing choir song and makes the moment much more special.Co-op is pretty simple to set up, with only one problem that will be explained later, as you just have to be in the same location to match up and you can set a password to make sure it is just you two. So long as the boss lives in that location you can just summon at any time, but they also have these maps you can always summon as the bosses respawn after reloading them.I like the armor having special types of animations, it makes the backstabs look really over the top and it's nice. Very edgy, but in a good way.So many abilities to try out and build. Literally so many options on how you wanna build yourself, the only downside is that not all armors/weapons/abilities work with every blood code so you aren't fully allowed every option. However you are still allowed to build several different options for use at the time or later.It has this partner system, which is optional to use, but is pretty nice. Never have to feel alone while adventuring even if you don't have a friend to join you. They do repeat dialogue and state the obvious, sure, but not to an annoying level at all. Plus if you die, they'll bring you back so long as they aren't stunned or dead.Io exists.Neutral:You feel frail a lot of the time. It really feels like everything can oneshot you if they feel like it. If quick dodging didn't exist I'd call it a problem.Animations aren't all amazing for cutscenes, even for characters that are pre-set look kinda iffy at times.Cutscenes that are needed to activate by walking a few feet after seeing a cutscene.. just to have that happen again. The ""loading zone"" hallways sometimes cause fps drops, but they aren't too bad a drop.While parrying isn't a must, it does suck that the armors have different parry times. So if the one you like to use has a slow one, you just plain won't parry unless they either wind-up slowly or you are a God at predicting.Cons:""Anor Londo"" location is terrible. It's a maze with hardly any landmarks, pure white everywhere, and enemies that are surprisingly tougher than later areas. Getting through the area is annoying, let alone getting everything. Probably the only reason a lot of people don't get the best ending first try.Trying to 100% the game is mostly easy, but one achievement is collecting 400 of this one item. You get one everytime you beat a boss in co-op whether you are the host or not. Going through it with a friend and doing pretty well everything we got around 100. From a full playthrough. You can collect these offline, but the tedium is worse.There's a co-op bug that makes no sense and has not been fixed despite how long it has been known. It's stated everywhere, but if you use this review to get yourself and a friend into the game I'll just post the way to fix it. When you use a blood code and you get finished with it or just want to change to another one, unequip every ability from it. If too many abilities are on, even if they are in reserve, they will not let you two connect. Sometimes items do this too, so just remember to store everything you don't need away on the off chance it can happen.			"

Recommended,59.7,"																game is super sick. feels like playing in a decent dark anime. Has enough dialogue and stuff to keep the game from being depressing and enough combat depth to be super fun. There's a lot of builds I wanna try out and the mechanics make a lot of the ideas I've had feel rewardingIt's only crashed twice both times are from leaving the game open for longer than 12 hours so I'd say it's pretty stable.The animations have so much love to them. After you parry there is a different animation if you don't move. For the claw, you shake your hand out as the claw disappears.My only complaints are that with all the waifus theres no romance options and some sections are too hard without a partner. Certain enemies can end up stun locking you when they attack you in pairs because their attack window is about the same size as their windup/cooldown frames. So dittos can get you stuck until you die. If you do die and you don't want to go get your XP then you can just rest in the hotsprings and get half.Really a great game.			"
Recommended,28.1,"																Something needs to be said about the story telling in this game.  Yes, Dark Souls has an amazing story, but often times you find it by going on the wikipedia and getting lost in the lore - there, you're literally a revenant walking through the world unaware of your true purpose save to move forward.  In dark souls, its poetically hidden, no matter how many times the poor bosses beat you down, you keep coming back, relentless.Here though, here you're not so alone, but you have that same sort of feeling 'something happened before I came here.'  At first it seems like a lapse in story telling, ""Did I miss the first game or something?""  But you carry on regardless, because the gameplay itself is satisfying.  Somewhere along the way however, you really get pulled into that question of 'what is happening and why?' Of course, you don't *need* to sit through all the vestiges and flashbacks (which by the way from an artistic and budget perspective, were done fantastically) but the game rewards you for doing so, and then you no longer feel like you're in a white room just killing baddies as a vampire.  No, there's really something much more going on here.TLDR:  The altering tempo of this game is phenomenal, you expect dark souls and get Angel Beats.  Also:#Attendants Lives Matter Too((And if your bitchass says something like 'wait for sale' or 'not worth $60' you really need to evaluate what kind of work you expect from devs, a lot of work went into telling a fantastically artistic story and building a world.))

Recommended,25.2,"																As a huge soulsfan I'd like to review this game and compare to actual souls games. With + I mark what I liked and - what I don'tRoleplay +As and rpg it serves its purpose. I'd say it's more roleplay than darks souls since there are more interaction with your char and npcs. Also, it's good to be able to see your char face in cutscenes as well. Char customization is good as well.Music +There wasn't as much OSTs as in DS. 90% of the bosses have the same theme for 1st and 2nd phases. Also, most of the vestages (flashbacks) have the same music. Is it bad? No. The music is good, moving, touching and fits mostly whenever it's played. So, the quantity of the music kinda compensates with its quality (not as good as DS anyway imo)Plot and characters +The plot is simple, the chars are pleasent. Some of them feels more alive than others (glimpses at Io), but overall they are fine.Now to minusesGameplay -Let's say it tried to be soulslike and hard at the same time, eventually failing at being both. If you just want to play a game for the plot and you aren't some hardcore gamer (casul) the game will be difficult due to its similarity to souls games in terms of locations and soul losing mech. If you are hardcore darksouls pro (got gud) then it still will be frustrating since the controls, skills, animations, i-frames feels extrimely clunky. I played DS Remastered recently and it felt much more smooth the CV. Moreover, it's not only your MC who has this problems, all the bosses, especially those who aren't ""main"" bosses (successors) have atrochious hitboxes on their attacks. Some of them have attacks that are undodjeble for tanky classes (e.g atlas). Most of the bosses were easy even without companion (I ran solo till I was able to have Io). Running to those bosses will be much more frustrating (yes, cathedral guy with mace). I can still add a lot about gameplay flaws, but lets say, it's not what I expected from soulslikeLevel design -Remember how well were DS1 location intertwined? Or how well placed were bonfires in DS3? CV took a stupidly difficult level design (**** the invasion system in offline) and corridor like aspect from DS3. But despite being corridory it still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maze (I hate cathedral, we all do). Leveling system - In DS series most of the leveling and progression is neat and never felt out of place. Yes, you can overlevel yourself in ds3 or get access to late game content in ds1, but you the vast majority of first playthrough won't be like that. What about CV? At the first half of the game you will feel yourself being underlevel. Most of the time you won't be able to outdamage even an average enemy. BUT, approximetely at the middle of the game (while or past cathedral) you will start gaining levels extremely fast, making you feel yourself being overlever, which will be frustarting for the hardcore fans. Traveling with companions also makes the game too easy, especially if this companion is the real person who is more or less familiar with souls gamesOverall, I will recommend this game, but be prepared for a tonn of frustration and don't expect it to be soulslike in terms of combat systemThanks for reading this wall o' text			"

Recommended,71,"																You wanna have your self-insert character be the core role for one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime stories I've seen in a long time? Then this is the game for you!Gameplay is intruiging, and I respect the devs for their innovative thinking with changing classes on the fly whenever you want and the partner system is actually pretty interesting, but it doesn't save this game from its incredibly unpolished combat system.None of your attacks have impact at any point and it genuinely feels really clunky. Backstabbing is a constant inconsistency at every point because sometimes it works and sometimes it just becomes a regular attack despite the fact that you're pressing the same button at the same position as you did last time and made sure that your enemy wasn't in any form of stun.Speaking of story, the game really REALLY wants you to be invested in it so they force you to go through a ""memory lane"" sequence every time you upgrade a class(which you can thankfully skip, but you're still going through 2 loading screens and potentially a conversation based on which upgrade you got so it's still a massive downtime). This is the only game that does this and it's definitely nothing to praise it about. This also happens when you beat a main boss but that gets a pass because THAT makes more sense.Cluster♥♥♥♥ of mechanics, the game doesn't know what it wants to be. I can't recommend it, sorry...			"
Recommended,58.2,"																While I'm a sucker for anime styled games, this was a rough start for me. It was hard to like Code Vein at first because I was so used to DS and thought it would feel very similar. It doesn't. And it isn't quite as mysterious either.  Story (so far) Code Vein's story isn't too special and pretty predictable. You're a vampire who needs to get blood in order to survive. The only twist I've seen is that instead of dying from either light or lack of blood you instead become the Lost a.k.a. lose your sanity. Once you're Lost you can't come back. A good portion of the story seems to come from the memories you pick up and go through in your journey but I found 3/4's of it to be boring to walk through and you get a summary for most once you're back out anyway. The main story besides that has just been 'we need to collect blood and find the source'. The voice acting is pretty typical anime acting. Sometimes it isn't bad and sometimes it can be really cringey. Gameplay This was shaky for me at first. Again because of DS and Sekiro. The gameplay is a mixture of Dark Souls and Devil May Cry with lots of both character customization and combat/ability customization. There are rarely open areas in this game so if you hate linear types stay well away. You can use swords, spears, axes and hammers with their own light and heavy attacks and style. You don't need to stick to just one as you can equip two main weapons and change classes on the fly to suit your needs depending on the situation. Being stunned is a bit more annoying in this game since you can't recover as quickly and guarding will still net you some damage. Multiplayer needs a bit of work as connections can be cut before you fully make it in to help or be helped and it works almost exactly like DS apart from having to use an item. They can only help you until you've defeated the major boss in the area. But you can help others indefinitely which is nice so long as they don't treat the game like a full hack n slash and die literally within minutes. Optimization *REALLY* needs work here. I have a monster PC and get unplayable frame drops first loading in and going to the home base and some areas. Healing also needs improvement. Not in terms of the actual healing but the animation time and the fact that you cannot move whatsoever. It takes a solid 4-5 seconds to use your quick items and the input doesn't always register when you need it in MP.  Graphics and Sound Beautifully styled. The weapons are all incredibly fancy, too damn big for one smol man/woman to carry and packs a lot of punch like Monster Hunter especially with the skills involved. The gear is just as stupidly over the top eccentrically stylish and that's partly why I love anime styled stuff. Each character can have his/her own unique style. The sounds don't sound realistic like the clangs of blades clashing in Sekiro but the hits sound sort've similar.  Overall (so far) While I *almost* decided to refund this, I stuck it out to see if it would get more challenging and more intense. It does! It's a really good anime styled lite Dark Souls for those that want a big challenge but don't want it feeling quite as unfair and rage inducing. Is it worth the full $60? It needs serious work for optimization and MP issues but otherwise yes. It's a nice change of pace from From Software.			"

All in all, it feels like they followed the Souls-like template to a point (customized builds, ""souls"" mechanic as xp/currency, dying/retrying, etc), but missed out on what truly makes those games great: combat that's challenging but fun and kinetic, loads of atmosphere, and a ""less is more"" storytelling approach.Also, big or small, every woman in this game has 3/4 of their sweater meat on display at all times.

However, if you aren't a fan of either of those, this isn't for you.I purchased this game to have a nice anime game, but I have a strong dislike for the soulslike genre, and this game is simply Anime Dark Souls.. and the anime aspect isn't strong enough to carry me through a souls game :P			"
Recommended,40.5,"																Code Vein caught me by surprise and it has no right to be as good as it is. Gamplay wise: as a souls like it brings a ton of good ideas to the table. It makes back-stabbing and parrying easier and for a good reason: drain attacks will provide you with ""ichor"" (mana) and you will need your powers (like, a lot, especially if you are playing without an IA partner), whatever ""class"" you chose to play. And speaking of class, building your character in Code Vein is a modular process: you'll almost get your powers from the get go and fit them together lego style. It's fun (though not necessarily intuitive) and leaves a lot of space for experimentation. Also you will die a f*ckin' lot, but hey, it comes with the territory: playing solo is a real challenge and bosses are a lot more agressive than in any Dark Souls. I'd say it's on Nioh's DLC's level.In terms of narrative, the game cleverly mixes gameplay elements with short reveals: you'll be scavenging through memories of past character through small and elegant flashbacks in order to unlock new powers. It keeps you invested in a quite adorable anime fashion. The story is cool and manages to walk the thin line between outrageous anime tropes and sophisticated fantasy. Yes, some characters are oversexualised, but in a ""Métal Hurlant"" style that seems to borrow from old 80's fantasy novel cover art. Didn't bother me, to be honest.On the downside, I did feel the level-design was somehow unequal. I ended up wishing every level was as meticulously crafted as the ""vestiges"" or the home base. Dark Souls was very good at environmental storytelling, and it's something that's really missing in Code Vein. Sure, it goes all-out in the last area, but I still feel the game would have been near perfect had it pushed more of its lore through vivid visual ideas. As it is Code Vein is kind of a rough diamond and if you're looking for a cinematic Souls like, with real character development and an anime twist, go play it !			"
Not Recommended,26.6,"																I wish I could recommend this game, but I just can't. I'm not one for long reviews, so I'll just TL;DR my problems with it:- Too short. 32.6 hours, more than one of which was idling, and I quit just before the final boss. Also worth noting that I didn't rush through; made sure to 100% every map and collect everything I could, as well as doing all the chalice dungeons Depths maps.- Too easy. The combat's good, and it's not the easiest game, but it's a lot easier than any Soulsborne (not to mention shorter)- The plot is very poor. Your standard cliche storyline is more than made up for by good character writing (for the most part) in terms of your companions, but it falls apart elsewhere. Lots of monologues about friendship and cutscenes where everyone awkwardly shakes everyone elses' hands. Worst of all, the main plotline meanders and changes course seemingly at random, while companions are giving dialogue that ignores the last change in direction. The mist is evil! Actually, it's the protect the outside from us. Oh wait, now it's to protect us from giant monsters. They look cool though, right? Well you won't get to fight them, they're only here for one cutscene. It really feels like they put minimal effort, and possibly several aborted rewrites that weren't fully fixed.Basically, it feels like it had so much potential, but was let down by a lack of effort outside of the combat system. Maybe if they add a lot of new material, but sadly it seems like it may take that season pass just to bring the game up to standard.			"

Not Recommended,21.3,"																General Tips:- The majority of hidden items and sections are found by dropping down from ledges, so look down them regularly if you want to find extra goodies. There are no illusionary walls of any sort.- The main method for permanently learning new Gifts is by killing enemies with the appropriate Blood Code equipped, but this Gift learning progress starts slowing down as you start outleveling the zone you're in, so striking a balance between spending Haze on Gift unlocks and level ups is recommended.- Certain zone bosses have an NPC standing outside the boss room who offers to repair a vestige from vestige fragments scattered in that zone. While doing so is optional, it can only be done before defeating the boss and not doing it first has both story and gameplay ramifications. Broadly speaking it's not a bad idea to try to restore all or at least most of them if possible, especially if you plan on only playing through the game once.- Giving gifts to your base NPCs can let you trade for some handy stuff from them like unique weapons, weapon transform materials or items that temporarily increase your maximum Ichor, but nothing critical to beating the game. Different NPCs like different gifts, and these gifts can also be bought with ""Old World Materials"" from a merchant who appears at the end of the first zone once the boss there is defeated.- The Depths side challenge areas can be unlocked by finding maps for them, and they tend to be worth clearing whenever you unlock new ones. Some maps are rewards from side quests which can be acquired from NPCs in previously cleared zones, so if you want to unlock all of them it's worth going around checking old zones for any new quest NPCs whenever you beat the end boss of one. This can eventually get kinda laborous, but side quest NPCs do at least immediately show up on the map without having to look for them.- Enemies tend to not pay attention to your AI partner before a fight starts. Additionally, if you draw an enemy away with a bayonet shot/dagger/projectile gift and you're a distance away, you can peel your target from a group and draw them somewhere else to deal with them. This can lead into situations where you can let your partner hit the enemy you targeted while the rest don't act at all, which can be handy if there's a troublesome ambush group that you fell for earlier that you want to deal with.Combat Tips:- The game is balanced around having an NPC follower with you, so while going solo is possible, it should be considered an optional extra challenge.- The training dummy in your home base is very handy for testing out weapons and Gifts. Also, different weapons even in the same weapon category can have different movesets or abilities, so it's usually worth giving new weapons a few swings to see how you like them.- The fastest Quick dodge is a dash that you don't have recovery/standing-up time from, though even the mid-weight Normal dodge does the job quite well. The Gift ""Hasten"" acquired from a relatively early Blood Code improves your dodge level and can be worth slotting in especially with heavy gear.- There are many good swords in the game but slashing weapons tend to do poor damage against armored enemies, so having a piercing or crushing one as backup is not a bad idea when facing them.- The Gift ""Shifting Hollow"" which teleports you a short distance forward and is learnable from one of the starting Blood Codes can remain very useful all throughout the game with some practice, in essence acting as an instant forward dodge with a good invulnerability period at the cost of 1 Ichor (MP).Gear & Stat Tips:- In addition to their numerical differences, Blood Veils (armor) are divided into 4 categories (Ogre, Hound, Stinger & Ivy) which governs their parry and drain attack animations. Notably the Ivy type which spawns blades striking up from the ground is a special case in that its charged-up drain attack can actually be moved around freely before releasing it, allowing for long-range enemy pulls even from long distances or around corners.- Gear upgrade materials are a pretty common find and all except the final +10 upgrade ones can eventually be bought from the store, so don't be too hesitant about upgrading your favorite stuff. Gear infusion items are more limited and mostly available from NPC trading, but these are not very important for a standard playthrough. If you want to go full tank mode though, infusing a very high-defense weapon like the Zweihander with Fortification can bring it up to 100% physical resistance when blocking.- A weapon's Drain Rating governs how quickly you recover spent Ichor when attacking an enemy, and is worth paying attention to especially on builds that cast things a lot. It's also not to be confused with the Drain Attack stat which governs the damage of drain attacks.- In a similar vein, the Light and Dark Gift stats for the most part only govern the direct damage dealt with Gifts of the appropriate type, and not the duration or effect of buffs. A couple of notable exception to this later in the game are the Drain Rating buff ""Bloodsucking Blades"" and the damage buff ""Bridge to Glory"", both of which can get very potent with high caster stats.Enjoy this good anime game!

One big difference is, that you don't level your stats separately, but only your character as a whole. There are many, many classes you can choose from and that you can change on the fly. Each with different stat distributions. In this way you aren't locked into one build that you don't really like (like can happen in the souls games) but you can try different tactics and builds.Another big difference is that you actually have cutscenes and dialogues conveing a story.

Recommended,11.2,"																Its a pretty solid souls-like game. It is a little too like Dark Souls in a lot of aspects, but if you just want more of the same this game is perfectly fine. It is a little brutal sometimes however, since you're expected to have an A.I. companion with you at all times to revive you it uses that to give it more lee-way in terms of difficulty. Also worth mentioning is that the co-op mechanics actually work in this game. This game's equal to signs respond almost instantly and from anywhere on the map. The password matchmaking lets you pair with friends, and the game will scale you down to their level, equipment and Estus pretty well while not crippling you. The netcode can be a little wonky in strange ways though, and I  probably wouldn't do a coop run of this game with a friend who has >200 ping. Even with a friend with a low ping, it can still sometimes have some really strange desync problems, but nothing that makes the game unplayable.TL:DR - If you like Dark Souls you'll probably like this, it is more of the same in most aspects. Would definitely pick up on future sales.			"
Not Recommended,2.8,"																If the words ""anime Dark Souls"" intrigue you, then this game is right up your alley.  While the combat can be clunky at times, its pace is somewhere between Dark Souls and Bloodborne.  The story isn't terrifyingly convoluted, and the edginess is often outweighed by the idea that with friendship all things can be overcome.  Hilariously anime at times, but overall fun.			"

There isn't really any issue that i have with any bugs, bosses etc. id just say to keep an open mind to how you play because it tries to focus off of playing one specifc class or code			"
Recommended,15.6,"																Code Vein is a solid game for fans of Souls-like or action RPG genre. Granted, the graphics style and anime tropes in story can be turn-off for people who don't like this, but if it's your thing, that will make the games even more enjoyable. To each of their own I guess.GameplayBesides the core gameplay style of Soulsborne games, Code Vein bring its own ingredients to the old recipe. Bloodcodes, which are basically ""classes"" in this game, affects your stats and grants different skills (Gifts). Once you have mastered a skill, you can use it even while equipping another bloodcode (with a few exceptions). These skills can be active or passive, you can have 4 passive skills and 8 active skills at the same time. You can even change the bloodcode on the fly to customize your combat style further. With a big arsenal of available skills, there are a lot of builds for you to discover. I do wish Code Vein has more weapon and armor variety though. Combat feels challenging, but also more forgiving for new comers of this genre, since you have strong skills (as stated above) and a partner to help. It makes exploring less lonely too, especially in maze-like maps (I'm looking at you, Cathedral of the Sacred Blood). If you are an old fan and prefer more hardcore combat, you can leave the partner behind and try Enhanced difficulty in NG+ (be careful, it's a steep increase in term of enemy HP/damage). All in all, fun and challenging game to play.StoryIf you don't like anime/manga tropes, then Code Vein story really isn't the best out there for you. But the settings are pretty attractive, side characters have their own story which you can explore via the fragments (called Vestiges) that can be collected throughout the game. And I have to admit that the story attracted me quite a bit, with touching moments, and sometimes quite intense too. You still have to somewhat stitch the details together, but main plotline is not as vague as in, say, Dark Souls series (DS fans love that though, lots of space for speculation and imagination). With 3 different endings, Code Vein can keep you busy for a while.Graphics and Music2D fans would love the extensive character creation. Code Vein looks pretty nice, with overall bright and colorful landscapes. Each map/area has distinctive color pallette too, makes them unique and easy to recognize. Men of cultures will definitely be interested in female characters *wink* Bosses looks intimidating enough for me (the fact that they kicked my ass helps too...). Animation has room for improvement, but it's actually not bad. The audio is surprisingly high quality, and got me hooked. From the BGM to voice acting (I actually like the Eng dub for once) to vocal songs, very few things to complain about this part.ConclusionCode Vein is easily an 8/10 for me. Admittedly, it has some great premises but can't realize all of them, but the final product is still an interesting journey with compelling gameplay. It's not for everyone, but for its target audience, Code Vein surely delivered.P/s: oh, and no one judges if you spend 3 hours in character creation, so feel free. Feel more like 4 or 5 hours for me though lul.			"

Why ruins our fun, why say it's Co-op then do this? What is this stupid idea, did you find this idea in a pile of poop? What does it bring to your game to limit players in such ways?			"
Recommended,14.2,"																Game so good, it motivated me to finally get some batteries for my controller.I mean, it's true, but the game has... issues.TL;DR: It's an easy mode souls-like with character abilities and it's anime. The story is horrible, the characters are boring, the level design is not up to par, but it's fun slashing things. Also, titties to the point of cringe. Somehow it justifies its own existence on gameplay alone. Get it on sale and for the love of Cthulhu do yourself a favour and skip the story, and turn off partner chatter.You're already dead. NANI?In CODE VEIN you're a Revenant (read: vampire) in a walled-off city full of hollows the Lost. That's about as much exposition as you need. There is a plot, but it boils down to (Frampt's voice) KILL MORE BOSSES (damn straight). To this end, you're equipped with not only armour and weapons, but also some anime superpowers, as well as an AI partner. Relax, my fellow lone wolves, you can turn the partner off, or make them quiet. The game obviously had a large budget, it even has an fully animated anime opening. It looked like it's going to be a cool anime story. But no. It feels like the story was written by robots who never saw human emotion. I'm going to write more about the story, but maybe let's talk about the gameplay first, as that's where the game shines.Hiten Misturugi-ryu: Anime slash attack!So, it's kind of like a step between Dark Souls and Bloodborne. You're only equipped with a weapon and blood veil (read: entire armour), but you can block using the weapon. Parrying and backstabs are present and encouraged, as they provide you with Ichor (read: mana). What Soulsborne series didn't have, though, is Gifts (read: abilities). You can use Haze (souls) to buy abilities for the classes you have unlocked, and after mastering them by using them in combat you can mix-and-match them however you see fit. The abilities are both passive and active: you can have 4 passive ones and 8 active ones equipped. There's a LOT of them (I believe the number is between 150 and 200).There's your genereic ""teleports behind you"" (nothing personell, kid) attack, there's a frenzied combo, there's a blood bullet... but there's also mines, regeneration of damage you're about to take, hell, there's even an ability which heals and buffs you but kills you after a short while, for when you need that final burst for the boss. Something for everyone. Depending on your build, you're bound to find something that works pretty much every time. Oh yeah, let's talk about builds.Babby's first SoulslikeA lot of things are incredibliy simplified in this game. Instead of having stat points, you have stat ratings, which automatically translate to points under the hood. How do you influence the ratings? By changing your blood code (class), and (I think) equipping a different blood veil. Which you can do at almost any time - in theory you'd probably even be able to do it in combat, but if something's active or on cooldown you can't, so probably not. This means you can completely effortlessly change your build from a STR-tank to a caster just like that.Now, I know a lot of people say GIT GUD and all that jazz, but I personally think giving you the option to try out different playstyles without commiting is great. A welcome addition to the series. Another simplification is the armour: there's only one piece. Not only it's much easier to upgrade/maintain, but also always makes sure your character stays stylish, no mismatched gear pieces. Loving that.And then there's the fact that you have an AI partner, who can not only take the heat off you, but also can revive you if you take fatal damage. It makes things so much easier. You plow through the areas like it's nothing. You could of course turn off the partner, but the areas are not quite as interesting or varied as in Soulsborne, so it's actually better to go through them quickly. Going through the same area 10 times in DaS is one thing, here it would be a chore.You're still reading? That's where the good things end.Flat is (not) justiceYou thought I'm talking about breasts, huh? Well, I was talking about character depth, but actually, let's talk about breasts. The vast majority of women in this game have cartoonish, almost hentai-sized breasts. There's four that don't, out of which two are typecast as lolis. Most of them are also constantly in various states of undress, wearing tattered clothing just cause (men of course don't).If this sounds like it's not a problem: for one thing, it's just simply embarassingly childish. Second, it's distracting, and third, I'm playing a game, not watching soft porn. What I'm saying is there's a tasteful way of doing titties in games, and this game is very, very untasteful. The women in general feel like cardboard cutouts. Generic personalities, acceptance of being seen as homemakers, laser focus on serving others. Wait, did I say women? Scratch that. All characters are horribly flat. They're so flat, so uninteresting, so generic, that even though the game really goes out of its way to tell you their backstories and show you them in emotional moments, you just can't be bothered to care. I don't think I've ever felt 'I DON'T CARE' of this magnitude. The story has nothing to give, yet somehow gives too much of itself.Fermented anime mixThe characters are very 'Japanese'. They're repressed, can't express their emotions, stick to traditional tropes and roles. One guy is pretty openly sexist. Guys like brandy, girls like chocolate. Because of all this, the story just doesn't stick together so well. Or at all. Yes, there is a story. If you like anime because of great stories with unexpected twists, well, you're not going to like this one. Is this the standard for JRPGs these days? I don't know, as I don't really play them anymore, except the occasional Final Fantasy. Don't expect mystery and intrigue like in Souslike games. This game shows that less is indeed more. The setting is alright, barely escaping being bad. The plot, such as it is, never manages to capture you. I'm too stubborn to skip cutscenes, but I implore you: Do that. Really. You won't lose anything. And whatever you do, don't do side quests. Absolute waste of time. Hint: You can skip vestige memories as well, and I recommend you do so as well. I watched them all and they almost universally disappointed me. They boil down to ""Oh, look, this villain was secretly good too, oh no, or this good guy was a villain secretly"". Nah man. Get a plot that works.There's some cool music in this game, but it only plays during cutscenes. All boss fights (sans the last one) have the same battle music. Such a waste.Such a wasteThis looks like it could've been a really great game. But it wastes all the potential in an almost masterful way. In spite of that, the gameplay is just plain fun. That's why I end up recommending this game. After all, games are things you PLAY. Game PLAY. And the gamePLAY in this game is just fun enough. When I wasn't rolling my eyes at yet another pair of tits shoved into my face or cringing from the music swelling during an appalingly devoid of emotion scene, I had fun. Good ol plain slashy slashy fun. Just... like I said. Skip the story.			"

Recommended,17.2,"																Well , the definition of ""anime dark souls"" is pretty correct , but to sum it up here are the pros and cons.Pros+ The combat is great , and a bit challenging , if you leave your partner at base you'll notice that+ The game is well optimised , it barely ever runs under 60 fps for me and I have a 1050Ti.+ The story is interesting ( for me at least ) it keeps me wanting to play more and more.+ The character creator has a lot of options , so you can try to make your perfect OC.+ A lot of attention to detail like the characters falling asleep after idling and a lot of animations for certain things , that would otherwise be ignored.Cons- The multiplayer is far from perfect , getting the guest kicked out after resting at a mistle , with no other option to heal except use some code related ichor abilities is pretty unacceptable , not to mention it's hard to find a session,nevermind getting help from people. I get that it's trying to have the same system as dark souls , but here it makes no sense , firstly you can't place a mark somewhere for players to summon you , you just have to spam the search button and change regions hoping someone request help , not to mention in dark souls it made sense for the spirit's to fade after resting at bonfire or not interact with the world due to their form , or not be able to beat the boss if the host dies , since they are tied to the summoner , but here it makes no sense for you to return mid bossfight since the host died and you have like 3 seconds left on the revive ability.- There are few clothing options and there is no option to hide or at least customise your bloodveil , therefore depending on yourplaystyle you may not see your default customisation.- There is an accessory limit , that sounds stupid to me , I don't know why it's even there .- A few bugs here and there , one time I fell through the map ( though only one time )- I still haven't figured out why you are restricted to co op only in unexplored areas , so basically if you want to replay an area with a friend you have to either play on their save , either make a new save and play there.OverallI think the game deserves it's price and if you're interested give it a try , it's no masterpiece , but it sure is fun not to mention well made. At least half of the issues I've mentioned can be fixed through small updates or upcoming dlc's.			"
Recommended,6.1,"																Code Vein : By Triple F""Code Vein"", the action RPG developed and published by Bandai Namco, emerges from the shadows as a magnificent symphony of gothic artistry, thrilling combat, and a deep, emotionally charged narrative. Drawing inspiration from the Souls series while infusing it with its own unique flavor, Code Vein stands proudly as a captivating and unforgettable experience.From the very first frame, ""Code Vein"" enchants players with its breathtaking visual design. The post-apocalyptic world is gorgeously detailed, a mix of desolate landscapes and grand architecture overtaken by nature's reclamation. The character and enemy designs are an exquisite blend of elegance and darkness, reflecting the game's central theme of vampiric beauty amidst ruin. Each locale is distinct, offering a diverse range of environments that seamlessly weave into the narrative, making exploration a genuinely enthralling journey.The character creation system is a highlight, allowing players to sculpt their revenant avatars with astonishing precision. From facial features to body types, every element can be tailored to one's liking, resulting in a truly unique protagonist. Further personalization comes from Blood Codes, which function as distinct character classes, granting players access to varied abilities and play-styles. This depth of customization fosters a strong connection between the player and their avatar, enhancing the immersive experience.Combat in ""Code Vein"" is a mesmerizing ballet of precision and strategy. Drawing inspiration from the Souls-borne formula, battles are intense and demand a careful balance between offense and defense. The introduction of Blood Veils and Blood Codes adds an innovative layer to the combat, allowing players to drain enemies' blood to enhance their abilities, reflecting the vampire lore beautifully. Weapons feel impactful, and mastering the various skills and combos is deeply rewarding. Moreover, the AI companion system, which grants a partner to assist in battles, adds a layer of camaraderie and tactical depth.At the core of ""Code Vein"" lies a narrative that surprises and resonates. The story is not just about survival; it delves into themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the nature of humanity. The game's NPCs are memorable, each with their own tragic tales that weave into the overarching plot. With a world shrouded in mystery, unraveling its secrets is a driving force that keeps players engaged throughout their journey.The musical score of ""Code Vein"" complements the visual grandeur impeccably. From hauntingly melodic tunes to pulse-pounding battle themes, the music serves as a vital emotional anchor, heightening the impact of every moment. Voice acting is well-crafted, breathing life into characters and adding emotional weight to their interactions.While ""Code Vein"" stands tall as an exceptional RPG, there are minor areas that could benefit from refinement. Occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-ins momentarily disrupt the immersive experience, though they are infrequent and do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.Ultimately, ""Code Vein"" is a masterpiece that successfully carves its niche in the action RPG genre. It captivates with its gothic beauty, combat finesse, and deeply moving narrative. Fans of challenging games with rich lore will find themselves entranced by the world of Vein and its cast of characters. Bandai Namco has crafted a symphony of darkness and blood that will resonate with players long after the final credits roll. In a sea of games, ""Code Vein"" shines as a unique gem, a testament to the power of creativity and storytelling in the medium. It stands as a reminder that even in the midst of darkness, beauty and resilience can emerge, and that the bonds formed through struggle can be the most enduring of all.			"

Recommended,22.1,"																Anime, Souls series and a pinch of God Eater for flavor. Fairly good character customization, an interesting story and as much as I hate the term, it IS fitting - great souls-like gameplay. Nothing thus far has been blatantly unfair, though there are some cheap shots on blind corners here and there (like any ""good"" souls game, am I right?). Level scaling doesn't seem to exist - Level up as often as you like, or spend your haze on gifts instead. Levelling up is the one of two primary methods to increase any of your stats beyond the base levels from your currently active blood code. Upgrading gear would be the other. No flat treadmill that kills any sense of progression here, if you level up and want to go stomp the lowbie zones in your endgame gear/stats, you go right on ahead, you monster.Some of the codes are a bit broken (*cough*atlas), while others are utterly worthless (harbinger for instance is literally garbage and shouldn't even exist). But it's a PvE game so balance means nothing - You can either pick the easy, ""OP"" codes and breeze through with a great sword, or give yourself a challenge by doing something insane like actually trying to use a bayonet.Graphics are great, and I've had zero performance issues. One single crash in the home base is the only technical issue I've encountered so far.			"

Something about it just didn't quite appeal to my Dark Souls sensibilities.I was so wrong.  I chewed through this game when I finally picked it up.  I'm putting it aside for now, but already eager for a future play through.It will feel familiar to any Souls player, but it deviates here and there, particularly in combat.  I dare say, the combat improves on the Souls formulas in many ways.  Flashy, punchy specials that feel weighty are available through an interchangeable class system that allows you to cherry pick passives and actives to build your toon.  You can also change these at ""bonfires"" for free.  So if you want to rip through mobs as a glass cannon and then swap to a tanky greatsword build for the bosses, you can (and I did and it was great fun).It's not as challenging as Souls, the atmospheres lacks the majesty that Miyazaki weaved, the lore is not as esoteric (though the story is developed more traditionally and quite good), but it is an AMAZING game in it's own right.9/10My only major gripe is that most females are presented as ridiculously over-sexed, which removes any actual allure.

The story is easy to follow especially if you were to forget what happened (instance: you did not play the game for weeks) you can go to the spa and there is past check to take the grasp of the story again. The main character which is you of course , forgot who she/he is. The vestiges which allow you to check the back story of the other characters is a huge plus for me, I loved exploring and taking my time taking those vestiges just to see the memories of their character before. Side quests are important as well if you want to learn more about the itself situation overall that's what really grabbed me and urged me to complete every side quest (not necessary plus take note to side quests give you depths map sometimes, so I completed most of them for that reason). The story is a 10.The mechanics and the character customisation are well-made (+boob size). Overall 9.6Gameplay (combat wise) to be fair some of the skills were really easy to be countered and cancelled by the enemy. The range is confusing and I never played it so no opinion ab it. Parry...you guys parry...?not going to say anything ab it. 9.5 cause of the parrying mechanic that I never understood.Difficulty is.. from my experience since it's my first souls game that I complete so uh.. not hard and not easy.. in the middle somewhere to be fair.

Recommended,38.4,"																Never played a ""Souls-Like"" game before. I appreciate the mechanics, and the combat. This is a fairly fun game to dive into and feel good about your own growth, tactics, and experimentation with your build. It's nice that you don't need to feel tied down to any one style, either; If long-range, evasive, or ailment-based combat isn't doing you any good, it's trivial to equip some heavier armor and complimenting abilities, and go in swinging. Overall, the gameplay is good and that makes the game recommendable.The story and dialogue are lacking, however. The visuals are beautiful, the character customization is top-notch, and the overall level design is nice! ...It's just.. I feel like I'm coming home to a parody of a post-apocalyptic teenage dream, that's populated by dramatic-sounding, but ultimately boring dolls. The game's whole setting revolves around these characters' memories and revealed pasts, but the player's a mostly silent protagonist with dialogue that matters in no way, and whose only true decisions involve walking in one direction, or pressing a button. But hey, at least they're darn handsome.			"

Not Recommended,16.8,"																 Personally i rate this a 3 / 5 I had purchased the game with the  Multiplayer Coop   inmind, which they do proudly boast about on the steam page.And if you are planning to buy this game to play Coop, do read the features i was  disappointed about. I had to change it from a 4 to 3, as i discovered much more ''features'' in the game.I don't understand how no one mentions these. Regarding Multiplayer: *Note you have to set  matching passwords  to join one another.**Note that these seem to be features not mentioned on the front, so probably won't change.*- You can only join each other for  duration of the selected mission,  not in Town.- You can only join each other if the  Boss for that map is not defeated  yet.- Player joining the Host,  cannot pickup/get items from boxes , but may still get loot from monsters.- Player joining the Host, has  reduced healing items , understandably.- During Multiplayer,  both players cannot access the checkpoints , meaning in order to use it you have to disconnect and reconnect again(Joining player will have loading time)... GamePlay Nitpicks: * People seem to dislike the DLCs, as they only add dungeons to fight in and get loot. But i got them cos they add a small amount more of gameplay for me and my bro.  But the DLC price seems ridiculous ** Customization of Character is quite amazing good, except for the fact of  limited costumes , no unlockables added so far. ** Don't seem to be able to customize your blood veil color (Cloak/Armor), so you're stuck on a red color palate for the whole game.* Replayability seems limited from what i can tell so far,  As compared to God eater or Dark Souls 3 or even monster hunter, Plus the price difference is a whopping X2?, Does not seem worth if you ask me.** Inclusion of the partner system  (A.I Bot), destroys the gameplay,  makes it extremely easy, but frustrating:1. There are no perks if you remove the partner, therefore why would anyone do that.2. Bot kills everything with ease for you, so you cant drain them for energy.3. Bot likes to alert enemies if you planning to go stealth kills.4. Because of this, the fear and difficulty of the game is drastically reduced.* Lastly the game is unnecessarily slow (Probably why people say they spend 40 hours to complete), lots of walking through empty corridors, water to slow you down,(All with no enemies OR nice scenery), once again as compared to Dark souls 3. Conclusion * So if you plan to  play this alone, you'll have a blast.  Multiplayer is possible and quite fun, if you don't mind the features i pointed above.*I will still say it is fun on its own, but  greatly underwhelming,  as it seem like it was suppose to be something different from a regular ''Souls'' game,Instead it really is 50% shorter than a dark souls, sad, cos the inclusion of blood veil(Armor base drain) and blood codes (Magic skills) made the game extremely fun, but  the game is short ...If they removed the Bot partner entirely, or gave a perk to going without it, the game becomes more fun, or if they allowed Coop players to atleast access the Checkpoint to level, that would make Multiplayer more fun.Only recommend getting this game if you don't mind the price.I gotten 2 copies when it was on 40% sale, to play with my brother.I also hope that this is not the only 3 DLCs this game gets, and it may get more updates,if not i'll regret not getting Dark Souls instead...

Not Recommended,15.7,"																43 hours in, and not even done with my first run yet. Quite a lot to explore, decent story, and a well polished combat system. I've seen a few complain about having NPCs with us on missions, but you can just remove them from your team, and you'll be playing solo-mode. I personally love this option, as it allows for both casual and more hardcore players to have fun with the game. I also have yet to encounter any bugs, so that's another big plus.overall, a quite polished games, with a good amount of content, and worth a replay for the different endings one can get.			"
Recommended,15.9,"																Don't get this game, just play Dark Souls instead. Every good thing this game has going for it is cancelled out by something else.The character design is unique and interesting, but the characters themselves are extremely boring.The lore is really interesting, but the story and the way it's told is awful and sucks the life out of the world.The gameplay is really good, but only because it's carbon copied from Dark Souls.The only thing this game really has going for it is the character creator, but Dark Souls has one of those too. Just play Dark Souls instead.			"

Not Recommended,46,"																They made this tweet https://twitter.com/RashMok/status/1186312983544242178?s=20And promised an update on the currently unavailable pre-order weapons.In PS4 these are available to be bought in a separated DLC, yet in Steam, it has been 3 years and these weapons are still locked for any player that did not got the pre-order.It is infuriating that a developer do this to the game, if these were only cosmetic weapons, then it would be fine, but these are unique weapons with customized stats, and now nobody can get them.

Recommended,53.5,"																This game does so much right, but also so so so so so much wrong. In this games case good beats bad. Definitely buy when it is on a sale. It has glitches and bugs, lack of difficulty. The game is also short and the maps are so maze like and late game become painstaking vs. pleasurable to explore. It has great customization and co-op. It has a ton of classes and build potential. This game also has a lot of cool stuff to find, collect, and unlock late game. To do everything in this game it will take upwards up 50 hrs. I got for $30 USD. Well worth it.			"
Recommended,4,"																First things first, don't be fooled by advertised concepts of this game. It is very shallow and does not fulfill on what it tries to accomplish. It is best to view this game subjectively and without any conceived notion to get a better understanding of what to expect.I genuinely disliked this game. It was very boring, long, redundant, teenage fantasy that was very poorly written and often conflicted with its main theme. So, this game was gravitating to being a ""Souls Like"" title, whatever that means since i honestly didn't feel a connection with the two core ideas. The only thing is that, like the Souls series, when you die you lose your currency until you pick up later or die trying and lose it forever. That is pretty much it. The thing that made the Souls series such a juggernaut of a design is that it leaves you feeling isolated, vulnerable, and clueless of anything in the world or your quest. Code Vein goes the entire opposite direction, which would be fine if the game wasn't conflicting with themes and ended up a boring long stroll. It was rather easy for the most part, information is everywhere about everything, and you are given a partner. It is optional to quest alone but most of the game feels as if it was designed to have a partner. A side note, which ever npc you choose to accompany you, they will annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you from how much they repeat their lines and how often they talk.As stated, the game is very easy, until you get to a boss which is just cheap not hard. A hard boss by design is like a puzzle, you need to approach the challenge within a certain direction to achieve your goal, while the boss is telegraphing it's actions and posing mechanical difficulties by nature due to it being a part in the game to test you skills and wits. Code Vein throws conventional design wisdom out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ window, the bosses deliver devastating, sometimes one hit kill attacks without even telegraphing them. It's just weird, you could find a boss charging up for a weak beam attack and the very same boss would, within a split second, dive into the arena and freaking kill everyone. That is what a cheap boss feels like, it is less of a challenge and more of a chore and a test of luck.Standard enemies are dumb, not much of a challenge and pretty much-repeated variants through the entire game with just more stats. Anyone who has ever played a JRPG knows how that feels.Monsters and bosses have a weird design when it comes to attacking, as in, for example, a monster has it's weapon above its head ready to strike your general direction, you would naturally dodge away from the soon to be struck area, but here is the kicker, the aim just magnetically follows you. I cannot emphasize enough how this does not make sense. You might not think this as a concern but wait till you see how dumb it is in game. You dodge ninety degrees to a side and it just magically turns on you like a lock aim. It almost makes dodging meaningless. Story wise, I would have loved for it to not exist. It is mindless nonsensical babbling, even when it makes sense it somehow feels dumber, it’s like a Young Adults novel, world is doomed and you the shiny hero with bizarre abilities come to rescue everyone and whatnot. A generic story is fine, but one that feels so heavily pampered to teenage audience, with its EDGY aesthetics and DEEP CONVERSATIONS which ultimately hold little to no value, it's just exhausting go through. Don't expect much story wise from here.Something that confused me was music choice, you would often find vocal opera like themes in most of the game, except in the base where there are music boxes here and there, turning one on will play a metal rock piece. Why does that exist? Maybe I am overthinking this detail but it kind of bugs me.Finally, while there are a lot of potential builds for you to brows and try, most of the time you will stick to something familiar because most of the playstyles feel the same. So, it is variety without much quality. I was bored to death and was barely forcing myself to just pickup the game and finish it, I even checked the mod scene for anything that would excite me to continue, I ended up with a model nude mod (Wrong type of excitement but at least it did the job).You have the choice to buy this, just don’t get your hopes up or you will be disappointed.

Not Recommended,12.8,"																Ive been enjoying the game so far, sunk over 20 hours into it over the past three days and I would have to say I have a bit of an addiction.The story is pretty typical for a shonen anime with you being the chosen one- who only you can save the world etc.etc but even so I still find it charming. I must be a sucker for these kinds of things.The soundscape is great and the music tracks fit the game really well. The memory scenes are phenominal and I cant help but watch and stare as the game pulls them together in a fluid motion. I really like the way how they deliver the stories of the characters, it really reminds me of the fallout 4 memory chair section. Its beautiful.The combat is by no means super fast, the enemies DO hit like trucks and if you misplace yourself, especially in the early game you will die quickly but that will be offset by your companion and their abilities as you grow.I dont even have to mention the character creation. Its perfect, I love it.Overall I would strongly reccomend this game who loves souls-like games and is up for a mediocre challenge.			"
Not Recommended,18.7,"																This game is getting held back by the dark souls like mechanics. It should be closer to anime DMC than anime dark souls because it feels like the devs read the first chapter of ""Why dark souls is good"" and winged from there. It is a but annoying to play before the half why point but it picks up from there when your build becomes fun to play. I hope a second one comes out with less dark souls and more anime to be honest.			"
Recommended,66.2,"																Had a good time playing this alongside with a friend. Exploration is fun and there's a decent challenge (and sometimes more than decent...) at least for me, who hasn't played Dark Souls and was kind of nervous about the ""Souls-like"" tag. Character creation is super fun and all the armor looks great, I liked the story and the multiplayer.			"

Having multiple endings makes for several hours more worth of gameplay than one would originally anticipate. Definitely a challenge for anyone looking for something similar to Dark Souls in difficulty.			"
Not Recommended,58.7,"																Too hard. The first main boss has very poorly telegraphed attacks, The boss hits too hard, you don't have enough heals or hp, don't do enough damage, don't have any way to cure status effects that the boss spams, etc.I think I need to give this piece of advice to every single developer interested in making a souls-like: you need to PLAYTEST your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Fromsoftware used to do this, and then they released the absurdly bad Elden Ring.Then we have games like Nioh, which are preposterously hard, then we have this game, which is bad hard.Terrible. Hire me and i'll make a better game for you.Boobies don't make a good game.			"
